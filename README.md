# Repostitory stats

Here are some quick and dirty stats for he Canterbury Institutional Repository ([http://ir.canterbury.ac.nz])

Data has a snapshot of all the metadata for the IR, and repostats.py is a generalised script for pulling out metadata based on a header (which should be a dublin core metadata field).

Subjects.txt is output from repostats looking at ANZSRC based fields.
