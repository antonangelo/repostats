Trump as President, and in the context of the large degree of support he received from white women. This paper analyses the event of the ‘women’s marches’ that took place globally the day following Trump’s presidential inauguration for its significance for the present and future of feminism. The consequence of the marches has been debated both by participants and non-participants, due to the broad range of issues, interests, and demands present at the events. While there was a diversity of participants in the marches, a common criticism from non-participants was that the march was insufficiently political in its goals and manifestation, too novice and too disparate to constitute real political action. This paper responds to this concern and its implications by staging an exchange between Hannah Arendt and Jacques Rancière, in order to clarify the possibilities of movements such as the marches for the future of feminism.",,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/13481",,"en",,,"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.","Hannah Arendt, Jacques Rancière, Feminism, Political theory, Women’s Marches",,"“White Women Elected Trump”: Feminism in ‘Dark Times,’ Its Present and Future",,,"Journal Article"

Conceiving of financialisation as a strategic response to a threat that must be brought under capital’s control through reorganising the exploitation of labour-power, it provides a reading of the seemingly abstract sphere of financial circulation as fundamentally dependent upon the very material and primary labour of reproduction. The article undertakes an analysis of how social reproduction is increasingly financialised today, in ways that play on and reinforce the persistently gendered reality of this work for the purpose of financial accumulation and increasing the profitability of labour. From the gendered targeting of financial instruments, to discursive tropes of women’s pathologies and responsibilities in household financial management, financialisation both creates new terrains of reproductive work and deepens households’ and women’s entanglement with financial markets to ensure their survival. Drawing on the critical writings and political strategies of autonomist feminism, this paper argues that women’s reproductive labour is central to the continued ascendancy of finance capital and, consequently, that feminist struggle’s for autonomy, self-valorisation and socialisation of reproduction are central to its destruction. Understanding what finance means to feminism and, in turn, what feminism might mean to finance today is imperative for a relevant contemporary feminist politics and to effective anti-capitalist strategy alike. This begins with a critical re-examination of the emergence of the hierarchical sexual division of labour particular to capital relations and its status in contemporary finance capital.",,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/13485",,"en",,,"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.","financialisation, social reproduction, gender, autonomist-feminism, finance capital, Wages for Housework",,"Feminism, Finance and the Work of Reproduction",,,"Journal Article"

I then  elucidate how Weeks’ Marxist utopia (her demands of basic income and less work) require a “hopeful subject” and positive freedom, while Zizek’s Hegelian logic and vision of a communist future require the negativity of freedom, a divided subject, and hopelessness.  Weeks’ feminism posits a direct opposition to capitalism, setting boundaries to its external limits, while Zizek’s Hegelian logic would require the reconfiguration of capitalism’s internal limits.

This (imperfect) reference to Freud’s question hopes to draw attention to the particular and the universal underpinning the signifier feminism, a slipperiness that works idiosyncratically at the threshold of public and private politics which, though it is perhaps the most unifying aspect of feminism, nevertheless undermines it. To politicize the personal one must question the signifier that comes to universalize an indefinite article for, as I argue in this paper, what ‘a’ woman wants is beneath the bar of what Feminism wants when it is mounted in public discourse. To continue to invest publically in a signifier of personal politics––as Jacqueline Rose advocates (2014)––then, one must rephrase the question: of what does this signifier Feminism speak when it is mounted in public discourse? This paper considers some mechanisms by which this signifier generates and mobilizes desire, fantasy, and phobia in public politics where feminism’s knowledge product covers over or, in Rose’s terms, “sanitizes” those “disturbing insight[s]” (2014: x) of experience, “everything that is darkest, most recalcitrant and unsettling” (2014 xii), in the “furthest limits of conscious and unconscious life” (2014: x). Here, where this signifier constitutes an ideal-ego, its effects are inhibiting. In short, this paper argues that before any future of feminism can be imagined, those occupying a feminist position—discourse, politics, or identity—must ask what their unconscious investment in this signifier is. In Lacanian terms, one must relinquish feminism’s discourse of protest and complete the circuit through the analyst’s discourse to ask: what does <em>a</em> woman want in feminism?

Expanding on Baudrillard&rsquo;s critique, the paper argues that the engine of neoliberal capitalism is a trade in abstract negativity that obfuscates its catastrophic consequences for both marginalized populations and the global environment. In this context, the task of criticism thus is not to enumerate political prescriptions for the immediate alleviation of the present and ongoing catastrophe but to advance an ethical sensibility that can situate what Bataille calls the &ldquo;restrictive economy&rdquo; of debt within a &ldquo;general economy&rdquo; that emphasizes expenditure over accumulation. Wallace&rsquo;s novel provides a literary frame in which to imagine such an ethics by suggesting that the first step toward addressing the end of the world is to assume responsibility for the excesses of consumerist desire, that is, to realign our attention away from the debt&rsquo;s abstract negativity and toward the mounting trash heap that literally and symbolically obscures the possibility of another future",,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/13088",,"en",,,"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.","Debt, Garbage, neoliberalism, Baudrillard, Bataille, Infinite Jest, Environment, Psychoanalysis",,"The Real (of) Debt: Notes Toward an Ethics of Trash","Journal Articles",,

It goes back to ancient Southwest Asia (and Rome), where we find three functions of debt. It was primarily a means for securing labour of the context of a chronic shortage of labour. Its secondary features included the flow of wealth to the lender and the securing of class differences. However, we need to distinguish debt from credit, since the two are often assumed to be part of the same structure. While debt was extractive, credit was allocative. It relied on a mutual system of knowing interaction among village communities. With these distinctions in mind, it is possible to return to the question of remission or amelioration. On this matter, I argue that such amelioration was only partial and targeted, functioning as a safety valve for an economic system facing crisis. It was also the opportunity for significant political spin, and did little to alleviate the actual problems.

Where Hume and Nietzsche located the origin of trust in the capacity to make promises - debts conceived in terms of values &ndash; this article explores the origins of modern distrust and its concomitant pursuit of selfinterest. Examining the market economies of the 16th and 17th centuries in England, one finds these were characterised by a shortage of coins so had to rely effectively on trust. Wealth consisted largely of &lsquo;credit&rsquo; or trustworthiness, for this was the basis for access to goods and services with a promise of later payment. As such, wealth was not a possession but a reputation, and the pursuit of reputation took precedence over the pursuit of possessions. Since default on a debt could easily spread by contagion, the basis for collective welfare was personal morality. The key question, then, is how this conception of credit came to be replaced by one equivalent to debt, given a precise value and time for repayment. It will be argued that in this context the best way to prove one&rsquo;s creditworthiness was to pay on time with the debt issued by a sound institution such as the Bank of England or the Exchequer. The financial revolution in England had the effect of turning the pursuit of &lsquo;credit&rsquo; into the pursuit of wealth, where debts assumed the money functions of means of payment, unit of account, and store of value. The result was a transformation of morality: pursuit of self-interest, in the form of an ability to pay in money, became the basis for personal morality, while money became the measure of value",,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/13079",,"en",,,"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.","Value, debt, credit, money, trust, Friedrich Nietzsche, William Petty, financial revolution",,"On the Origins of Modern Debt and Value: Revisiting Friedrich Nietzsche and William Petty","Journal Articles",,

The argument of this paper is that value plays a key role for losing dignity or a loss of dignity both in the contexts of labour and of debt. Namely, in the context of labour what is critical is the value of things, and in the context of (public) debt what is critical is the value of debt, since both values are considered to be in a contraposition with the human value or the value of man (worker and debtor or rather &ldquo;debtor&rdquo;). It is thus reasoned that value held primarily in the interests of the economic market is counter to human value and human dignity; however, it is not also counter to moral value, as dignity is not just a human value but also a moral value. Namely, it is noticed that the role of the moral values is to mask the importance of such value held primarily in the interests of the economic market on the one side and the simultaneous unimportance of the human value on the other side. Thus, although the European Union publicly promotes both sides of value, the difference is that the value held primarily in the interests of the economic market is being promoted in actuality, whereas human value is being promoted only in words, first and foremost v&iacute;a statements of morality.",,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/13090",,"en",,,"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.","human dignity, human value/worth, moral value, (public) debt, labour, value of things, value of debt, European Union",,"Debt, Value and Dignity – as a Human Value and as a Moral Value","Journal Articles",,

I argue that we are living in a fetishistic society insofar as fetishism is not only collective but also objective. However, I am not opening up totally new territory here, since, for example, Zizek argued that commodity fetishism is &ldquo;the unconscious of the commodity form,&rdquo; and Jameson expanded the idea of the objective quality of commodity fetishism towards what he calls the &ldquo;historical amnesia&rdquo; of consumer societies. However, I hope that my reflections can be seen as an extension of these positions in two important respects: first, they go beyond the concept of commodity and tie the concept of fetishism back to the concept of capital, and, second, they tie the problem of amnesia and fetishism back to Marx&rsquo;s method.",,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/13082",,"en",,,"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.","Marx, commodity fetishism, capital, debt, abstraction",,"Fiction without Fantasy: Capital Fetishism as Objective Forgetting","Journal Articles",,

Benjamin&rsquo;s account of capitalism as a permanent cult gives a clue to its peculiar infinity. Debt shows the traits of a messianic time. More precisely, it partakes in the increasingly dominative temporality of preemption, where a catastrophic future is endlessly postponed by a homeopathic kathecon which in its action remoulds also the past. Disentangling from this logic through its intensification can hardly be successful, if anything because the capitalist engine is running idle at faster and faster speed. Alternatively, one should look for an interruption, a disengagement from the thrust to infinite valorization, in the direction of inoperosity, as a possibility that messianic time also discloses. To redeem our enslavement to debt, however, we have not to look at our relation with money, but at our relation with the world.",,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/13084",,"en",,,"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.","debt, pre-emption, messianic kathecon, Benjamin, Agamben",,"On the Infinity of Debt","Journal Articles",,

The first part addresses the nature of critique in general and of &lsquo;critique of political economy&rsquo; in particular which has traditionally been conceived as a critique of a mode of production in Marxian terms. The displacement of this object of critique - the mode of production - requires an understanding of the problem of the unity of this mode of production. The second part of our discourse addresses the problem of the money commodity, of credit and debt in relation to the unity of the mode of production. We deny, contrary to Marx, that money is a commodity and affirm instead the importance of a categorical analysis of credit and debt. Adducing an argument advanced by the Italian economist Augusto Graziani, we affirm that money is credit and debt in the initial phase of commodity production. The unity of the Marxian &lsquo;mode of production&rsquo; comes to depend on credit and debt and thus a &lsquo;mode of indebtment&rsquo; must be postulated. This consequence we name Lazzarato&rsquo;s problem in honor of Maurizio Lazzarato. We finally affirm that any future &lsquo;critique of political economy&rsquo; must address both the analysis and the treatment of Lazzarato&rsquo;s problem.",,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/13085",,"en",,,"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.","credit and debt, mode of production, money, the indebted man, critique of political economy",,"The Displaced Object of Critique: From the Mode of Production to the Mode of Indebtment","Journal Articles",,

Yet, the key tenet of these theories has not been Marx’s radical emphasis on the foundational role of production in human subjectivity. Marxist theories of art have, generally speaking, either examined the arts’ capacity for signifying social relations and class struggle – as seen in many a Marxists’ penchant for realism – or they have seen the arts as little more than aesthetic legitimations of ruling class ideology, a view which, in its most positive manifestation, can be found in the experimental and modernist tendency to undermine the morals and mores of the bourgeoisie by committed artists. Neither of these approaches, at any rate, sees art as a form and outcome of production in itself. In this article, I wish to present a Marxian theory of art, based on Marx’s entire oeuvre, from his earliest journalistic writings to Capital, which presents art as neither an aesthetic mimesis nor an ideological alibi of production.

The dominance of neoliberalism as policy has revived the notion of capitalism as human nature. At the same time the anti-humanism of poststructuralism has been replaced with posthumanism. There has also been a revival of the question of humanity in light of the anthropocene. Given all of these developments its seems worth posing the question of the human in Marx again. Taking its cue from the Sixth Thesis on Feuerbach which argues that the human essence is the ensemble of social relations, this essay examines the way in which labor constructs and destroys the generic figure of humanity. Ultimately, it argues that Marx can be understood as making a unique contribution to philosophical anthropology, not one that argues about any fixed essence, cooperative or competitive, but understands history to be the generation and corruption of different essences, of constituting the basis for solidarity and antagonism.",,,"2463-333X",,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/14505",,"en","University of Canterbury",,"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.","General Intellect||Etienne Balibar||Paolo Virno||philosophical anthropology||labour||Capital||Marx",,"Man is a Werewolf to Man: Capital and the Limits of Political Anthropology",,,"Journal Article"

Along with the capitalism and Protestantism arising in the sixteenth century, the natural science originating in the early seventeenth century is a foundational component and key catalyst of modernity as such.

The model: a labour theory of value wherein surplus value is created in production and this amount (sometimes less, never more) is distributed through the sale of commodities (which embed the surplus value / socially necessary labour time) but not necessarily at their value because of the operation of rents and interest. This modelling does not give a clear prognosis for capitalism. For a prognosis, I turn to Mandel. Mandel’s Late Capitalism describes imperialism as the search for super-profits. Part of this is the penetration of firms with higher levels of productivity into new sectors (thereby raising the organic composition of capital in the sector and reducing the rate of profit), and part of it is rent-seeking around minerals and land. This suggests that primitive accumulation is an ongoing process. It is certainly not a finished process as perhaps Marx suggested in his circuit of money-capital. Indeed, to what extent does M — C ... P ... C' — M' capture all the forms of revenue creation and distribution in general, and the creation and generation of surplus value in particular? What is the extent to which the events of the Great Financial Crisis necessitate a rethinking of Marxism, in terms of constitutinga challenge to the model and methodology in Capital, for example: (1) financialization, (2) primitive accumulation, and (3) class and consciousness.

This argument entails three steps. The first is to locate in Marx’s work the distinction between capitalism and markets, with the point that a market is not necessarily capitalist. Indeed, the history of markets indicates that most markets have not been capitalist. The second step approaches the question of contradiction, which takes on somewhat different meanings in European and Chinese situations. Whereas the former tends to see them as either-or, the latter tradition develops a stronger sense of both-and. In this light, the possibility arises that markets may have more than one feature, which in our time means both capitalist and non-capitalist – especially socialist – markets. The third step develops this point further, through the work of Ernst Bloch. Here I argue that modes of production do not supersede one and thereby negate one another, but that each subsequent mode of production absorbs the contradictions of the former and transforms them in light of a new situation.

The interesting aspect of these works is that they draw the implications of Marx’s critique of political economy not only for the comprehension of the fetishised forms of social objectivity in capitalism, but also for the comprehension of the forms of subjectivity of the modern individual. More specifically, all these contributions broadly share the insightful view that the content of the simplest determination of human individuality in the capitalist mode of production is its alienated existence as ‘personification of economic categories’. However, this article
argues that the limits of these perspectives become apparent when it comes to uncovering the grounds of the revolutionary form of subjectivity which carries the potentiality to transcend capitalist alienation. For these perspectives fail to ground the revolutionary form of subjectivity in the immanent unfolding of capitalist forms of social mediation. In the case of the Neue Marx-Lektüre, it quite simply leaves the problematique of the revolutionary subject outside the scope of the critique of political economy. In the case of Open Marxism, despite
valiant attempts at overcoming all exteriority in their conceptualisation of the relationship between human subjectivity and capital, they end up grounding the revolutionary transformative powers of the working class outside the latter’s alienated existence as personification of economic categories; more specifically, in an abstract humanity lacking in social determinations. In contrast to these perspectives, this paper develops an alternative approach to the Marxian critique of political economy which provides an account of the revolutionary potentialities of the working class as immanent in its full determination as an attribute of the alienated or fetishised movement of the capital-form.",,,"2463-333X",,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/14496",,"en","University of Canterbury",,"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.","Open Marxism||Dialectics; Neue Marx-Lektüre||Revolution||Fetishism||Capital",,"Fetishism and Revolution in the Critique of Political Economy: Critical Reflections on some Contemporary Readings of Marx’s Capital",,,"Journal Article"
"17811","10092/11654",,"Cassano, Graham",,,,,,,"2017",,,"This essay provides a close reading of Capital, Volume I, Chapter 15: “Machinery and Large-Scale Industry.” Part one examines Marx’s theory of the capitalist machine. Under capitalist conditions of production, the machine appropriates the worker’s skill, transforming that worker into an interchangeable adjunct or appendage. At the same time, machine driven industry employs women and children in ever-greater numbers, displacing male hands, and feminizing production. Finally, the machine emasculates the workingman and turns the world upside down. To dramatize this emasculation, Marx uses health and safety reports that rely upon gendered anxieties and masculine fears of the social disorder brought about by liberated women. Thus, I argue, Marx utilizes the gendered anxieties of his audience in order to construct an argument against capitalism. The second part of the paper examines the “invisible threads” that bind factory production to domestic, sweated labor. Marx provides an analysis of sweated labor that connects severe forms of economic exploitation to gender ideology, and he takes great pains to render visible the otherwise concealed labor of women in sweatshops. In telling the story of sweatshops, Marx once again finds women’s labor to be a fundamentally important force in capitalist development. Sweating allows some capitalists to accumulate excess profits through artificially cheapened labor. This early accumulation puts those firms in a position to succeed once factory legislation forces them to centralize production and eliminate their
“outworkers.” Thus, for Marx, women workers are central to the story of capitalists’ accumulation and capitalism’s development. Yet, at the same, Capital offers a normative vision of labor that assumes the masculinity of the working population and represses the political agency of women workers. The paper ends by comparing Marx’s fundamental ambivalence toward women workers with the more straight-forward “radical paternalism” and gender essentialism of Marx’s contemporary, the U.S. labor leader, William Sylvis. While this comparison highlights Marx’s difference with gender essentialists, nonetheless Marx’s fundamental ambivalence toward the necessity of women industrial laborers leads him to a theoretical blindness regarding the possible militancy of women workers. Even as he rendered visible women’s work in the formal economy, he was unable to see their militancy as workers.",,,"2463-333X",,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/14497",,"en","University of Canterbury",,"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.","radical paternalism||reification||machinery||gender||labor history||Marxian political economy||Sylvis, William||Marx, Karl",,"Capital, Gender and the Machine",,,"Journal Article"

This coincidence, however, only further highlights the utter incommensurability between these two events, between the theoretical and the practical achievements of Marxist and communist thinking. As Slavoj Žižek suggests, there is something of a “parallax"" between the critique of political economy and the political activity in Marxism, so that the proper engagement with one of the two tends to reduce the other to an inconsistent or even hopeless endeavour1. Usually, this is not taken as problematic, mostly because we are used to understanding Marx’s work as concerning the social organization of capitalism, while the work of revolutionaries would concern itself mostly with the dis-organization of this same society – so, for a while, we could compatibilize the objective temporality of the crises of capitalism with the subjective temporality of the political opportunity, the cyclical and the periodical points of view. However, today when the management of perpetual social and economic crises has become a form of government and we can no longer afford the luxury of concerning ourselves solely with how to undo or deconstruct pre-established orders and norms, the problem of social organization suddenly emerges – perhaps for the first time – as an urgent and central concern of anti-capitalist militant practice. Rather than wait for us on the other side of an insurrection, the problem of how to relate our critical theory of capitalism and a constructive,
affirmative view of social relations poses itself now, as a contemporary challenge. To recognize the emergence of this problem is, however, to also recognize this incommensurability, identified by Žižek, between Marxist theory and communist practice: between our conceptual resources – developed in view of rendering capitalism intelligible – and our practical experience – focused mostly on the interruption of pre-existing social orders.",,,"2463-333X",,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/14495",,"en","University of Canterbury",,"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.",,,"Organization and Political Invention",,,"Journal Article"

Debates have centred around the nuances of Marx’s conceptual complexities as well as how to interpret these to make sense of contemporary events, phenomena and crises. Such debates have also extended to the author himself – the degree of reflexivity as well as his ability to control the mastery of his own work.

This re-emergence of personal forms of domination takes place in the context of the impersonal domination that structures capitalist social relations. However, since fictitious capital is not a product of production, it therefore has not gone through the valorisation process necessary for the realisation of capital. Thus, fictitious capital represents unrealised value. In order to account for this inconsistency, fictitious capital is premised on a contract (debtor-creditor) that makes a claim on future labour, and therefore the valorisation of fictitious capital is suspended and accounted for by the dependence on the valorisation process to occur in the future, with its premise in future labour rather than past as in the case of realised capital. This temporal discordance results in placing increased pressure on social reproduction, a function that insures the reproduction of labour power, a variable at the heart of the justification of the circulation of fictitious capital. Significantly, this re-emergence of personal forms of domination is not solely based on the relation of the debt contract, as the debtor might not be a worker or even an individual but a bank or a hedge fund, but also the personal relations that uphold the ability for society to as a whole to reproduce the
labour power that will in the future account for the repayment of the debt. Therefore, personal forms of domination implicated in social reproduction of labour power re-emerge as a site with increased pressure as a result of an increased circulation of fictitious capital.",,,"2463-333X",,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/14503",,"en","University of Canterbury",,"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.","value-form||time||social reproduction||personal domination||Fictitious capital",,"Fictitious Capital and the Re-emergence of Personal Forms of Domination",,,"Journal Article"
"17821","10092/11654",,"Smith, David Norman",,,,,,,"2017",,,"The originality of Marx’s Capital is often underestimated. Countless commentaries have appeared, but only a few have taken the full measure of Capital’s truly unique and counter-intuitive outlook. Critics generally assume that Marx was pursuing familiar questions of economics or philosophy in a fresh way – that his aim was to explain profits, history, or ontology. Those goals were indeed part of his mission. But Marx’s wish to revolutionize society ran deeper than most commentators have realized. His goal was not just socialism or a classless society but, even more profoundly, a post-commercial society in which self-emancipated workers associate freely to share what they make, rather than producing for sale. He envisioned a society entirely free of commerce, in which products cease to be commodities and become freely shared goods that satisfy human needs directly, without facing daunting obstacles of cost and affordability.
Visions of this kind are ordinarily called utopian. And despite Marx’s reputation for radicalism – his standing, in the immortal words of Jimmy Carter, as “the grand daddy of Communism”1 – his utopianism is rarely fully appreciated. Several factors have contributed to this result. Not least is the fact that Marx’s name and ideas were coopted by parties that sought, and won, state power. These parties portrayed Marx as an advocate of centralized planning, and they had the resources to give this claim the veneer of orthodoxy. Marx’s actual vision of a society with neither exchange nor an executive branch of government was neglected.2 Another barrier to insight is the assumption that Marx’s agenda can be found mainly in his political writings. In fact, the deepest roots of his thought appear in Capital, where Marx not only “theorizes” value but opposes it, with utopian implications. To clarify this point, which Marx explains awkwardly, I offer a fresh account of his core argument.",,,"2463-333X",,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/14507",,"en","University of Canterbury",,"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.","Utopia||Commodity Fetishism||Abstract Labour||Value-Form||Exchange-Value||Use-Value||Price||Value||Capital||Marx",,"Sharing, Not Selling: Marx Against Value",,,"Journal Article"

Unlike Marx’s analysis of the commodity, his vision of communism is untenable because it lacks an adequate social ontology and rational conceptual structure: in short, it represents what can best be described of as an atopia. We detect what amounts to an Oedipal fantasy in the theory of communist association in which the famous general intellect is taken back from Father Capital such that liberated subjects enjoy the immediacy of perverse enjoyments offered up by the repossessed means of survival, the new Machine Mother that hums along in the background. Lost are the mediating particularities of callings and specializations necessary for life in a modern world. Primitivism, anarchism, and neoliberalism exhibit a similar atopic structure, in which callings and even jobs are negated, while the latter embodies a new transcendental logic that can summarized as an X –– anti-X –– non-X dialectic.

More than a 'mental experiment' the notion of interpassivity not only provides a theoretical workframe, but it also renders a practice. The fundamental tension provided from within interpassivity, fills the necessary requirements to properly examine some of the deemed mysterious and curious elements of the civilised post-modern existence. With this investigation, the author provided a theoretical perspective that opened up different possibilities of approaching or re-approaching crucial elements for many different fields, as well as, provoked an opening to many insightful articulations. From philosophy, psychoanalysis, art theory, literature, and now reaching many others fields, the consequences of interpassivity and its productive

It is never clear whether Standing wants to rid capitalism of its perversions, and thereby restore markets to their purified form, or whether this ethical-moral framing is a rhetorical strategy—a form of immanent critique – aimed at exposing the hypocrisies of those proselytizing the free market creed. At times, Standing sounds like a cross between Noam Chomsky and Milton Friedman. It is this schizoid movement from left to right and back again – a dialectical intertwining – that gives rise to what one might call Standing’s centrist libertarianism. He borrows from both right and left, ultimately serving up a strange ideological brew, advocating for the idea that markets should be made free, restoring the welfare state of postwar social democracy, freeing all manner of “commons” (from nature to intellectual property), enclosed within a universal basic income scheme.

What might it mean to interpassively respond to Interpassivity? Is not this collection of essays in this special issue itself a potentially doubly interpassive event (that is, interpassivity redoubled): delegate others firstly, to read the book and secondly, think about – and it is assumed, enjoy – the book to the point of writing about it? Of course, to claim that these series of events are interpassive is to also claim that many of the readers of these essays are in fact “delegating their enjoyment”1 of reading Pfaller’s Interpassivity. This delegating of enjoyments signals that enjoyment – or perhaps more so – the type of enjoyment delegated is a type of action and work in itself. Therefore, that enjoyment so delegated can also be a demand upon us that we seek to displace and in displacing we seek to replace our own, expected work of enjoyment. So, interpassivity – using these essays on the book Interpassivity as an
example – is the shift from production to consumption; or rather, is this not the consumption of others as displaced and replaced work of and for ‘you’?",,,"2463-333X",,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/15473",,"en","University of Canterbury",,"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.",,,"Interpassivity: The necessity to retain a semblance of the mundane?",,,"Journal Article"
"19103","10092/11654",,"Khan, David",,,,,,,"2018",,,"This paper explores the implications of Robert Pfaller’s conception of interpassivity with reference to a predominantly Lacanian perspective on subjectivisation. In so doing, the aim is to engender a conversation encompassing art criticism, cultural theory, and psychoanalysis. The reference to an “Interpassive Anti-aesthetic” is intended to suggest how considerations of interpassivity present challenges to the humanist-metaphysical prejudices and phantasms of the Western tradition. Specifically, it is suggested that interpassive phenomena expose as illusory (i) the presumed agency and autonomy of art subjects and art objects, (ii) the supposed emancipatory and democratic potentials of interactive and participatory artworks, and (iii) the ideological underpinnings of postmodernism — particularly insofar as the postmodern is defined in terms of its opposition to the modern. In accordance with Pfaller’s contention that interpassivity involves “selective contact with a thing in order, in exchange, to entirely escape that very thing”, on which basis, “Interpassivity is thus a strategy of escaping identification and consequently subjectivisation”, two primary moments of interpassivity are elucidated: interpassivity-as-delegation and interpassivity-as-resistance. The paper presents an understanding of the twofold nature of interpassivity in terms of the psychoanalytic treatment – specifically, the Lacanian proposition that “the experience of the fundamental phantasy becomes the drive” for the “subject who has traversed the radical phantasy”. In keeping with Pfaller’s original
intentions for interpassivity to provide a way of reflecting critically on arts discourse in the mid-1990s, these theoretical considerations on interpassivity and subjectivisation are applied to Nicholas Bourriaud’s promotion of relational aesthetics and relational art, as well as objections to this advocacy raised by Claire Bishop.",,,"2463-333X",,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/15479",,"en","University of Canterbury",,"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.",,,"Interpassive Anti-aesthetic",,,"Journal Article"

Once we have been introduced to the concept of interpassivity, once we have recognized it in our own actions with an amused smile – for instance, to use Robert Pfaller’s wonderful example, in the pleasure we as academics derive from photocopying books, from the delegation of our pleasure of reading to the machine, from staging the illusion of reading, an illusion for which a naïve observer could fall2 – we suddenly see the world through a new lens. Interpassive phenomena pop up all around us and with a childish pleasure we exclaim: interpassivity, again! Therefore, the theory of interpassivity must be highly credited not only for the introduction of a valuable concept and a theoretical tool, but also for being a source of pleasure (consisting in recognizing previously obscured sources of pleasure and finally being able to name them).",,,"2463-333X",,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/15472",,"en","University of Canterbury",,"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.",,,"Interpassive Phenomena in Times of Economic Subordination: From Self-playing Games via Cryptocurrency Mining to Dressing Up in Subversion",,,"Journal Article"

“The theory of interpassivity has at this point presented us with an unanticipated benefit in terms of a solution to a fundamental problem of cultural theory.”

Is this not a nice thing concerning theory; that it thinks in our place, that it unexpectedly gives a solution when we ourselves are stuck? And in a further turn of the screw, as I write these comments on Robert Pfaller’s book Interpassivity. The Aesthetics of Delegated Enjoyment, I cannot but see myself caught in this dynamic of delegation and outsourcing: for, am I, myself not put to work by this theory? Am I not hired so to say by the theory to do its work (however, arguably, with no guarantee of delivering the goods)? Of course, here one gets easily confused, what, exactly is doing the thinking? Is it active or is it passive? That is to say, thinking with theory, or, outsourcing one’s thinking to theory, or, becoming oneself the tool of theory; are these not all modalities where the line between activity and passivity becomes blurred?

In the latter case – and if the fake succeeds – you will be objectively clever and participate in the benefits of the people who really knew it – whether they exist in reality or not. This special variation of interpassivity is not only a more or less lame game for the reception of postmodern movies: There are hints enough to assume that the Middle High German literature strongly promoted interpassive cleverness. And for the courtly audience of a medieval literary performance, the showmanship was way more important than for the audience of a today’s movie. So, medieval narratives gave the opportunity of two complementary games of reception: Interactive engaging and interpassive participating.

My aim is to understand the various levels of significance interpassivity has in Pfaller’s thought, particularly as it is related to politics. Towards the end of this paper, I briefly bring Pfaller’s thought into dialogue with the work of Alain Badiou and Jacques Rancière, and assess the degree to which his polemic against the Left’s call for increased participation in politics is consistent — albeit paradoxically so — with the way these two thinkers relate politics to equality and to the category of the impossible.

Interpassivity describes the pleasure yielded by a subject when his or her acts of pleasure are experienced via the body of another. Simple examples include telling your friends to ‘have a drink for you,’ egging them on to create an online dating profile or asking your kids to send you a postcard. Something like the common parlance for the idea is the concept of ‘living vicariously.’ For Pfaller, ‘rather than delegating their responsibilities to representative agents, interpassive people delegate precisely the things that they enjoy doing – those things that they do for pleasure, out of passion or conviction’.

Sometimes philosophy can be seen as the ultimate clash of thought boxed into a field. We could name pairs and pairs of opposing sides, of opposing schools of thought, opposing rationales, opposing concepts and with time, see the in-depth level of complexity added to the homologies and analogies derived from the clashes embedded within this field. The investigation of a knowledge issue is a challenging proposal, especially when we are dealing with a field build upon diversity of thought. There are many risks and very few shortcuts. Well, it is safe to say that one of the fundamental issues of philosophy does revolve around the affirmative aspect of being or its negativity. In other words, all which is derived from the discussion if the being is or if it is not, is an open invitation to one of the greatest (if not the greatest) motif of philosophy.

Millions of women have joined the workforce. Leaders like the Prathibha Singh Patel, Sushma Swaraj, Anandiben are role models who show that women can rise to great heights.

This group of Urdu writers produced various influential works between 1935 and 1955. With the help of her works, Ismat made prominent presence by writing on areas which had not been earlier discussed or explored. She spoke for the exploited lot of the Indian society- the women. She gave to their feelings words and wrote many such works which discuss various issues which were hidden behind a veil. She wrote in a time when women in orthodox Muslim families were supposed to obey quietly the instructions given to them by their elders. Her stories had female characters which gave a blow to the dominant patriarchal ideology that a woman is the sanctum sanctorum of the home and therefore she is restricted from exploring various dimension of active sexualities. This paper deals with prevailing definition of sexuality in the backdrop of patriarchal society and the protagonist's deviation from this dominant definition in the short stories by Ismat Chugtai. The paper has a close focus on two short stories, Gharwali (The Homemaker) [1940] and Til (The Mole) [1950].

In this social commentary I will raise several concerns regarding the rehabilitation of rape victims. The information is based on my personal observations and conversations and interactions I had with the doctor of the mental health institution. I have also used data from secondary sources in order to provide a better insight into the situation facing contemporary India. Many of the women in the hospital I visited had been homeless before they were picked up from the roadside by government bodies and NGOs; many of these women had been staying in the hospital for many years. My observations show how different factors such as homelessness and a lack of adequate resources for mentally ill women lead to their victimisation and marginalisation from society. I will make recommendations for the rehabilitation of these destitute women that will help them to break this vicious cycle of marginalisation. Some of these recommendations are: involvement of different agencies for the resettlement of women, providing them with government jobs and ensuring they have adequate housing.",,"Ramavat, S. S.

Janie Crawford is the black female protagonist of the novel who dreams of reaching far horizons and for a relationship of equality in marriage. The novel is a saga of Janie Crawford’s journey towards enlightenment and developing an independent feminist identity. The present paper aims at analysing Janie’s struggle from a follower of patriarchy to becoming a self- asserting woman with Downing and Roush’s five stages of feminist identity development. I posit that Janie defies the stereotypical gender roles and breaks the conventional patriarchal boundaries that keep a woman’s movement in check i.e. within the four walls of a house. Although suffered degradation and humiliations in her attempts to realise her dream marriage, she is successful in the end. A step by step analysis of Janie’s journey reveals how she gains her voice, how she builds her identity and how ultimately she reaches the far horizons, the destination of her dreams. In the first phase of her journey, she accepts passively the accepted notions of gender roles and follows the well-trodden path of marrying a wealthy man to have shelter and financial security. Unable to establish any emotional connection with her husband, Logan Killicks, she leaves him for Joe Starks. With Joe Starks, Janie becomes aware of her further degradation. She is reduced to the status of the possession. Slowly and gradually she gathers strength inside her to raise a voice of protest against this sexual oppression. This revelation helps Janie to integrate her fragmented self and she learns to maintain a separate public and a separate private self. In the person of Tea Cake, she has a self-fulfilling and reciprocal loving relationship. Janie learns to acknowledge herself and her strengths. She becomes conscious of her own individual identity. She does not hesitate to shoot Tea Cake as an assertion of her identity. As a mature woman, full of Tea Cake’s love and remembrance, Janie is satisfied with her life",,"Kaur, S. (2016).

Within the last few years forced marriages have received media attention in New Zealand. However, it is important to note that there is no specific legislation to curb this problem precisely. As a result, women within these diaspora communities suffer breaches of their women’s and human rights. I will argue that in the context of forced marriages women from these communities are subjected to multiple forms of discrimination against them both at public and private level owing to their gender, race and ethnicity. At the private realms of their family and communities women are subjected to patriarchal violence, whereas at public level their race and ethnicity play a crucial role in their marginalisation. This results in denial of their basic rights. To address this issue I will expand the concept of public and private patriarchy given by Sylvia Walby. This is in order to elucidate that western societies are no longer Western, rather they are multicultural societies where the needs of women from diverse backgrounds should be addressed in culturally competent ways. Furthermore, I will employ the theory of intersectionality to elucidate how women from diaspora communities are further marginalised at a public level. For my methodology I will use secondary data. I will discuss two cases of forced marriages, in this article, that were published in the New Zealand media a few years ago. I conclude that a multicultural approach is required while framing and amending policies in contemporary New Zealand that will deal with different forms of cultural abuses.","The Journal of Project Monma Research Centre","Ambika Kohli, Forced and Underage Marriages in New Zealand: Some Reflections on Public and Private Patriarchy and Intersectionality, International journal for intersectional feminist studies, 1, pp.58-70.","2463-2945",,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/11180",,"en","Monma Research Centre",,,"CC-BY","forced marriages||underage marriages||diaspora||violence against women||women’s rights||public patriarchy||private patriarchy||patriarchy||intersectionality||New Zealand",,"Forced and Underage Marriages in New Zealand: Some Reflections on Public and Private Patriarchy and Intersectionality","Journal Articles",,

When slam poetry, a performance oriented oral poetry gathers momentum, it is worthwhile investigating, how this new style of poetry, that is far different to canonical forms, connects the contemporary literature back to oral poetry tradition among Blacks. The project investigates and establishes such connections of slam poetry to oral poetry. Black females were the doubly oppressed minorities whose voices were strangled in throats by the colonial patriarchal society for ages since they were not given the freedom to speak out their minds first because they were women and they were Blacks. Yet, they found spaces for the ideas in performance poetry through others who spoke for them and the poets they inspired and later through genres like slam they are successful in voicing the centuries old sufferings of Black women. The Black poets who got international critical attention were mostly from America and it was only towards twentieth century that we have Africans writing about Africa.

It gives me immense pleasure to write the first editorial report on behalf of our editorial collective. International journal for intersectional feminist studies is a publication of Project Monma research centre, and is published with the aim of providing opportunity for young researchers, scholars and postgraduate students to publish their feminist work and share it with the world. The journal also provides the young scholars a chance to peer-review other researchers’ work. This prepares them for future challenges and introduces them to the world of publication.
For the first issue we received diverse submissions on various feminist issues which highlights the different challenges faced by women across the globe. The first article from Aisha Bhatti & Dr. Rabia Ali provides an interesting description of the lifestyle and health of professional Pakistani women. The article sheds light on how social transformation has increased the burden of both paid work and unpaid domestic work on these women which affects their health.
In “Leaders in the desert: The Sahrawi women of Western Sahara” Johanna Higgs & Dr. Christine Ryan discuss the experiences they had with Sahrawi women in refugee camps in Southern Algeria.

Kohli argues that this suggests that the current legislation is based on the ideology of public patriarchy that is mainly experienced of by European women in New Zealand. However, the multicultural fabric of the New Zealand society.

However, the area remains under-published in the context of Pakistan. The present study was conducted in 2013 to explore the effects of lifestyle on women’s health in public and private organizations in Pakistan. The study was quantitative in nature and a sample of 330 professional women was selected by adopting a purposive sampling technique. A self-designed, close-ended questionnaire was used to collect the data. The results of the study highlight that health is strongly related with the lifestyle choices of the participants in modern organizations. Clearly, transformation and reproduction of gender roles have provided a space for women to enter the public arena to meet the demands of the globalizing world. Yet unfavorable working conditions and excessive work at the workplace coupled with traditional household responsibilities put immense pressure on women. As a consequence of this double pressure along with socio-cultural constraints arising from the existing power structure, professional women do not exercise, skip meals and consume junk food. This in turn leads to stress and health issues such as obesity and cardiovascular diseases among professional women. It is imperative that women realize the importance of maintaining a healthy lifestyle through personal efforts and a change in health behavior.","The Journal of Project Monma Research Centre","Aisha Bhatti & Rabia Ali, Lifestyle of working women in modern organization: Implications on health, International journal for intersectional feminist studies, 1, pp. 5-28","2463-2945",,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/11182",,"en","Monma Research Centre",,,"CC-BY","Lifestyle||health||professional women||modern organizations||diet||exercise||sleep||obesity||heart problems||Pakistan",,"Lifestyle of working women in modern organization: Implications on health","Journal Articles",,

This adds a duty on its legal system to ensure that its current laws can protect minority groups and adequately deal with culturally specific issues that arise due to different cultural norms. Many argue that the current legal system fails to provide adequate protection for girls and women from an Asian, African and Middle Eastern (AAM) origin; this is due to a lack of multicultural consideration and the addressing of specific issues linked to these ethnic groups. One such issue is the problem of forced marriages among AAM communities living in New Zealand. This article argues that New Zealand’s laws and processes do not adequately protect women of an AAM background due to a lack of specific laws and policies that can protect against culturally specific abuse. This argument is reached through the consideration of approaches and procedures through socio-legal methodology. This includes the review of governmental documents, semi-structured interviews with relevant organisations and experienced individuals in the field, case studies and independent research. I will conclude that there is a lack of cultural understanding within support organizations and public institutions regarding the forced marriage issues. Moreover AAM women are also not completely aware of their rights and the available support. Finally, I will provide some recommendations based on knowledge I have gained while conducting my research.","The Journal of Project Monma Research Centre","Sandra Iskander, Dealing with allegations of violence against women in a multicultural environment: Consideration of approach(es) and procedure(s) with regards to abuse allegations of women of an Asian, African and Middle Eastern origin in New Zealand, International journal for intersectional feminist studies, 1, pp. 40-57","2463-2945",,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/11183",,"en","Monma Research Centre",,,"CC-BY","Forced marriages||dowry||domestic violence||Middle-Eastern and African women||New Zealand",,"Dealing with allegations of violence against women in a multicultural environment: Consideration of approach(es) and procedure(s) with regards to abuse allegations of women of an Asian, African and Middle Eastern origin in New Zealand","Journal Articles",,

As two anthropologists we travelled to the refugee camps near Tindouf in southern Algeria to learn more about the leaders of the camps who we had heard were predominantly women. The Sahrawi became refugees after the Moroccans invaded Western Sahara after the Spanish withdrew as a colonial power in 1975 starting the Sahrawis long struggle for independence. Throughout our research in the camps women did not speak of violence or of rape. They did not complain of harassment or physical violence from their husbands. They instead spoke of the burning heat, the difficulties of not having enough water and their struggles for independence. The governing body of the Sahrawi, the Polisario Front was built with women’s equality being one of the strongest features of their social organization and that women’s equality was the dominant theme of life in the Sahrawi camps. Islam has also played a key role in the empowerment of women as the Sahrawi understand Islam as acknowledging men and women equally throughout the Koran and that Islam calls for the respect of women. Thus the example of the Sahrawi demonstrates that the equality amongst men is not only possible but that it is possible regardless of environment, culture or religion.","The Journal of Project Monma Research Centre","Johanna Higgs & Christine Ryan, Leaders in the desert: The Sahrawi women of Western Sahara, International journal for intersectional feminist studies, 1, pp. 29-39","2463-2945",,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/11184",,"en","Monma Research Centre",,,"CC-BY",,,"Leaders in the desert: The Sahrawi women of Western Sahara","Journal Articles",,
"15754","10092/12905",,"Albury, Nathan John",,,,,,,"2016",,,"Norway’s policy on its indigenous Sámi minority is oftentimes heralded as best practice in
fostering self-determination and home language maintenance. Norway’s policy rhetoric indeed
promises that all Sámi have a right to develop their home language, and that all Norwegian
children will become familiar with Sámi languages and culture. However, this paper takes a
more critical perspective of Norway’s policy. It argues that rhetoric has not been
operationalised to benefit all Sámi nor promote Norwegian familiarity with the languages.
Instead, the state appears to juggle its legislative obligations to promote the Sámi languages
with an ongoing ideology in the community that the Sámi languages cannot be seen as
contributing to the contemporary Norwegian nation. To make this argument, the paper firstly
reviews the state’s Sámi language policy to discuss fractures between rhetoric and policy. It
then reports the findings of a case study whereby public online debates over the past five years
about the Sámi languages in a national context were critically analysed. The case study indeed
reveals a vigorous preference to hold the Sámi languages at arm’s length, for reasons such as
that the languages endanger Norwegian identity, that the Sámi do not deserve an indigenous
status, that the Sámi are foreign to Norway and, conversely, that the Sámi do not fulfil their
responsibilities as Norwegian citizens. The paper concludes that a potent Norwegian ideology
against the Sámi languages may explain the state’s reluctance to implement its high-level
policy promises.",,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/12906",,"en",,"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"cc-by",,,"Holding them at arm’s length: A critical review of Norway’s policy on Sámi language maintenance","Journal Articles",,

The research investigates the attitudes of a group of first generation minority language children, of various ethnic backgrounds, to home language maintenance and development as well as their experiences of home language use both in school and in the family home. Data were collected from 17 minority language children, aged between 10 and 13 years and living in Ireland for a period of between three and seven years. Data collection methods included focus group interviews and semi-structured individual interviews, during which participants expressed beliefs, opinions and attitudes surrounding language practices. Interviews conducted with four parents of the child participants provided additional data. In addition, an interview with the teacher of a complementary language school for Polish children highlighted the efforts made by the Polish community; the largest non-Irish group in Ireland, to promote home language maintenance in the family. The data show that while the majority of children and parents display positive attitudes to home language maintenance and development, children face challenges in continuing to develop the literacy skills in the home language. The importance of maintaining and continuing to develop the home language for continued communication with extended family members is clear. The need for familial support in relation to the opportunities children have to engage in home language learning is evident. The perceptions of English as a global language and as a valuable asset were evident among both children and parents. There is no provision made for the formal learning of home languages to children in Ireland, and the only opportunity for children to do so is limited to privately run complementary schools, which are not always accessible to all nationalities. Concerns of children and parents regarding continued development in the home language are voiced, and in most cases, these concerns are borne out of a possible return to their native countries.",,,"2537-7043",,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/14402",,"en",,,"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.","home language maintenance||first generation||minority language||majority language||language attitudes||family domain.",,"Home language maintenance and development among first generation migrant children in an Irish primary school: An investigation of attitudes",,,"Journal Article"

This article responds by presenting family language management data from Ethiopian and Colombian refugee families living in New Zealand. As part of the researcher’s ethnographic involvement in both communities, data was obtained through participant observations, interviews with parents and children, and recordings of naturally-occurring interactions between family members. Findings from both communities differ greatly: While many Ethiopian families used explicit management for their children to speak Amharic in the home, Colombian families tended to prefer laissez-faire policies as they did not direct their children’s language choice. Nevertheless, their children typically spoke Spanish, their heritage language. 
As a theoretical contribution, a model is developed to coherently present the caregivers' choice of language management and their children’s typical language practices. This model helps to uncover similarities and dissimilarities across families and communities. Since families typically moved through different management and practice constellations over time, the model also assists in identifying recurrent family language policy trajectories.

In the second part, the parents reported that they relied both on productive and receptive acquired linguistic knowledge to negotiate linguistic contexts with the child. Language negotiation has been described by the parents as involving the practice of intercomprehension, a plurilingual communicative strategy, which allows participants to speak their first language, while exhibiting receptive competences in the language of the other. Eventually, in the third part, we will describe how the mothers and the fathers rationalized the children’s linguistic transition from their first language to the parents’ language and, finally, we will explore the parents’ discourse around language shift.

The focus is on how heritage (Polish) language socialisation goals affect these children’s identity negation as they grow up in a multilingual environment, and as they try to find their place in a new country and society. In particular, this paper examines the ways in which the children construct themselves as authoritative or unauthoritative heritage language speakers
The theoretical background, methodology, and final results are set from the longitudinal study (5 years) involving such students and their families, two of whom also attend weekend Polish schools in addition to mainstream secondary schools. The theoretical and analytical approach combines an Ethnography of Communication approach to data collection and field work, such as participant home and school observations, audio-recordings of children’s interactions with their peers, their teachers and parents, open-ended interviews, children’s samples of school work with Discourse Analysis approaches (Duff, 1995; Davis & Harre 1990, Harre & Langenhove, 1999, Ochs & Capps, 2001).
A particular focus is placed on epistemic, moral and affective stances taken by the children in question. Certain aspects of agency, such as variable participation, allegiances with heritage language peer groups, affective and epistemic stances taken with respect to sociohistorical norms and values of the Polish language and culture are illustrated. The results of the analysis are interpreted in terms of heritage language socialisation (Ochs, Schieffelin, & Duranti, 2011), describing how different educational contexts may influence children’s identity negotiation. This micro-analysis of heritage children language socialisation is contextualized within a more holistic account of the Polish community in Ireland (Singleton, 2007) – a community culturally shaped by, and in turn shaping, wider societal and educational ideologies, values and power relations.",,,,"2537-7043",,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/14903","en",,,"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.",,,"To be like a home extension’: Challenges of language learning and language maintenance - lessons from the Polish-Irish experience",,,"Journal Article"

Research shows that students from disadvantaged minority groups experience poorer achievement outcomes than students who are provided with equal academic opportunities. In education, it is important to understand how ST affects the performance of stereotyped students (Taylor & Walton, 2011). Reminders of negative stereotypes create questions of self-perception and uncertainty about one’s abilities. This process of suppressing negative thoughts and feelings manifest a fear of confirming the stereotype, which impairs cognitive ability and causes anxiety that affects performance during assessments. Fortunately, evidence suggests that value affirmation can help eliminate the negative effects of ST on assessment and learning (Taylor & Walton, 2011).

One important aspect of inclusion is how Gender and Sexuality Diverse (GSD) students are being supported in educational settings. This critical literature review identified three key challenges facing educators that prevent GSD students from being fully included at school. Teachers require professional development in order to discuss GSD topics, bullying and harassment of GSD individuals are dealt with on an as-needs basis rather than address underlying issues, and a pervasive culture of heteronormativity both within educational environments and New Zealand society all contribute to GSD students feeling excluded from their learning environments. A clear recommendation drawn from the literature examined is that the best way to instigate change is to use schools for their fundamental purpose: learning. Schools need to learn strategies to make GSD students feel safe, teachers need to learn how to integrate GSD topics into their curriculum and address GSD issues within the school, and students need to learn how to understand the gender and sexuality diverse environments they are growing up in.",,,,"2463-4417",,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/12841",,"en","University of Canterbury, College of Education, Health and Human Development",,"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.",,,"Challenges facing Educators with regard to Gender and Sexuality Diverse Students","Journal Articles",,

The results of the review indicated that the influence of positive behaviour management strategies was mostly positive, for instance student achievement, behaviour and school outcomes were all shown to increase when positive behaviour management strategies were implemented in a range of studies. There were a number of factors identified as fundamental to the implementation of positive management strategies, such as the necessity of the whole school being involved, and accurate data gathering in order to foster efficacy of these programs. Although the findings were mostly positive, there were gaps identified in the literature. There was a lack of gender identification as reported in the results of the studies, and there was also a lack in ethnicity data provided which is important in a New Zealand context. More research is needed in the New Zealand context in order to take into account the unique culture of Aoteoroa, as the results may differ from the findings of studies overseas.

Historically, literacy has mainly been a focus for teachers within the classroom, however a growing body of research has established correlations between parental involvement and students’ literacy achievement. This literature review critiques the body of research examining the relationship between both home-based and school-based parental involvement and literacy development. Studies have consistently found positive associations between parental involvement in literacy practices and students’ literacy achievement. Research indicates that despite these positive correlations, many parents do not engage in literacy practices with their children. This review discusses the barriers which prevent some families from engaging in these literacy practices with their children and presents a New Zealand case study highlighting a home-school partnership programme which addresses these barriers with the goal of raising student literacy achievement. Through the conclusions drawn from the critique of the research and case study presented, this literature review establishes best practice for parents and teachers and suggests relevant direction for future research into home-school partnership programmes aimed at increasing parental involvement.",,,,,"2463-4417",,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/12847","en","University of Canterbury, College of Education, Health and Human Development",,"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.",,,"Presenting a United Front: Parental Involvement Facilitating Children's Literacy Development",,"Journal Articles",

Despite the high uptake of this practice, the exact definition and nature of mentoring remains controversial. Several types of mentoring, with potentially contrasting goals exist and these can affect teacher outcomes, students and the positioning of teachers in society. Mentoring programmes also have effects on pedagogical practice, instructional effectiveness and the commitment beginning teachers feel towards teaching. Mentoring programmes are shaped by a number of interconnected issues, including dispositions of mentors and mentees, mentor training, the context in which mentoring occurs and societal expectations. Although the broad uptake of mentoring programmes appears to indicate that these programmes are beneficial, empirical evidence on the effect of mentoring is limited. The literature supports the assertion that mentoring helps reduce beginning teacher turnover, increase job satisfaction and raise student achievement. However these issues are not necessarily those novice teachers are most concerned with and few articles examine ways in which novice teachers can best utilise mentoring for their learning.",,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/14636",,"en",,,"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.",,,"The Effect of Mentor Teachers on Initial Teacher Training and Emergence as a Beginner Teacher",,,"Journal Article"

Secondary school counsellors are used for early intervention, with primary and intermediate schools lacking government funding to provide this support currently. The findings discussed support the relationship between academic achievement and mental health in adolescents. Current research has found that depressive symptoms for adolescents were 2-3 times higher in poverty groups compared to students not experiencing poverty. Adolescents (15-24 years) had the highest rate of suicide, accounting for one in three deaths in 2013, with rates of suicide in M?ori adolescents persistently higher than non-M?ori. Research has found that offering free counselling can be used as an effective method for reducing mental health symptoms and concerns for both M?ori and lower socioeconomic adolescents. Caring relationships between parents, schools, and community have been found to be important factors influencing happiness among adolescents.

Camellia, whose research focuses on decolonisation in Melanesia, had recently returned from the 2016 Australian Association for Pacific Studies (AAPS) conference in Cairns at which she had hoped she would meet other researchers of the Pacific from WSU; due to the multi-campus structure of WSU, it is often difficult to know if there are others at the university working in similar research areas, and conferences are a chance to find out. But there were no other WSU attendees at AAPS that year.

"19257","10092/13586",,"Diane, Colman",,,,,,,"2018",,,"In a recent report on Papua New Guinea (PNG), the United Nations Human Rights Commission (UNHRC) noted its concern at the alienation of land held under customary title through the granting of Special Agricultural Business Leases (SABLs). Its concern centres on the impact of SABLs on human rights, with the UNHRC citing that the granting of these leases “had negatively affected the ability of indigenous communities to maintain customary land use patterns and sustain their traditional way of living” (UNHRC, 2016:12). Yet, I contend, such an Indigenous rights-based approach to the issue is problematic on two levels. First, it is not clear which groups in Papua New Guinea should be considered ‘Indigenous’ given the country’s universal franchise and the lack of a politically or economically dominant identity group. Second, such an approach does not account for the widespread commodification of land held under customary title. The majority of land in PNG is held under customary title and is occupied by Indigenous smallholders producing crops for immediate consumption, the local market and for export. These two problems show that framing the question of land as an Indigenous rights issue glosses over the ongoing struggle between these smallholders and the Indigenous capital class in Papua New Guinea. This means that challenging the use of SABLs to alienate land held under customary title by positing such use as an infringement of Indigenous groups’ rights to traditional or non-capitalist land use would have little potential to protect customary land rights in PNG, seriously circumscribing the capacity for achieving positive development outcomes.",,,"2463-641X",,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/15614",,"en","Macmillan Brown Centre for Pacific Studies",,"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","CC BY 4.0","land||customary||rights||Indigenous||Papua New Guinea",,"Customary land title and Indigenous rights in Papua New Guinea",,,"Journal Article"

I suggest that by using an anti-oppressive social work practice approach where power imbalances are examined and understood within a wider context, we, as a Pacific community, are better equipped to create strategies and solutions that are inclusive of those traditionally not included in the conversation for change. We need to promote the importance of creating a shared, collaborative stance on the social and welfare needs evident in the Pacific diaspora in Australia and to involve diverse voices including the voices of non-Pacific people genuinely wanting to assist our own cultural capital and growth in Western societies. This can positively influence the people with the power to make social change to share control of change-making processes and to create multiple discourses that reflect the cultural diversity of those working for justice; this will allow us to move beyond the traditional, individualistic rhetoric of ‘us and them’ to ‘we’.",,,"2463-641X",,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/15613",,"en","Macmillan Brown Centre for Pacific Studies",,"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","CC BY 4.0","collaboration||anti-oppressive approach||Indigenous perspectives||decolonising Oceania",,"Connecting and collaborating across Oceania and its diaspora: A shared approach to meaningful development and engagement",,,"Journal Article"

Over seven thousand of these were Muslims who, like their fellow Indians, hoped to return home after earning enough money in Fiji. However, after the end of their tenure, some remained to start a new life in Fiji. Muslims gradually established themselves and their religious life started to flourish. Over time, as Muslims became better organised and more resourceful in Fiji, Islam slowly assumed a public and institutionalised role. However, it also developed in a syncretic manner because of the intimate interactions and mutual support structures between Muslims and Hindus. Over the last several decades, Islam in Fiji has taken a new turn with the arrival of the Tabligh Jama’at. There is a process of de-syncretisation in motion involving the abandoning of certain symbols and practices associated with “popular” Islam and the promotion of strict observance of scripturally based teachings and practices among Muslims. In the literature such a phenomenon is known as Islamic revivalism. This paper investigates Tabligh Jama’at’s revivalist activities in Fiji.

Often, students from minority backgrounds face mental, emotional and physical challenges associated with university study alongside the reality of living in two worlds – the first of their heritage cultures, and the other of the university as a Western learning institution. This article explores the experiences of the author, an associate chaplain at Western Sydney University, and the establishment of a monthly event called ‘Fellowship Over Food’. This is a night for Pacific students enrolled at the University based around spirituality, building social networks and, of course, food. It explores chaplaincy through Heshusius’ (1994) notion of a participatory mode of consciousness, alongside the experience of Flinders university chaplain Geoff Boyce (2010), which highlights the role of multifaith chaplaincy within university contexts framed as hospitality to strangers. This article uses the author’s reflections on the first ‘Fellowship Over Food’ night, which took place in August 2017, to consider how a non-Pacific chaplain can engage meaningfully in this cross-cultural space.

We discuss the challenges and advantages of doing so, in particular the need to develop shared ‘languages’ for description and analysis.

Since their arrival in the British colony as sugar plantation labourers, Indo-Fijian activists led counter hegemonic movements against the colonial government during and after indenture in 1920-21, 1943 and 1960. Indo-Fijian activists demanded political equality with Europeans and constantly agitated for better wages and living conditions through disruptive strikes and boycotts. After independence, the focus of Indo-Fijians shifted to political equality with indigenous Fijians and access to land leases from indigenous landowners on reasonable terms; and these were ongoing themes in the 1972, 1977 and 1982 elections. However, Indo-Fijian counter hegemony took a new form in 1987 with the formation of the multiracial Fiji Labour Party and National Federation Party coalition government but indigenous Fijian nationalists and the military deposed the government and established discriminatory policies against Indo-Fijians which were dismantled by the Fiji Labour Party-led coalition government in 1999. However, indigenous nationalists regrouped and deposed the government in 2000, prompting another round of protests and resistance from Indo-Fijians. Using Gramscian conceptualisation of counter hegemony as disruptive protest, resistance and dissent, I argue that political mobilisation of indentured labourers and their descendants was aimed at restoring political rights, honour, self-respect and dignity lost during colonial and post-colonial periods in Fiji. In this article, I argue that Indo-Fijian counter hegemony was in the form of mobilisation, based on assembling alternative ideas to create a culture of disruptive protests and rebellion against hegemonic social forces. Indo-Fijian dissent aimed at elevating the voices of the exploited, marginalised, discriminated against and disenfranchised in a society preoccupied with ethnicity and race. In this regard, the history of Indo-Fijian counter hegemony in Fiji is narrated within the historical structure of protests, boycotts and strikes and constant political agitation.",,,,,"2463-641X",,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/13642","en","Macmillan Brown Centre for Pacific Studies",,"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","CC BY 4.0",,,"Indo-Fijian Counter Hegemony in Fiji: A historical structural approach",,,"Journal Article"

In July 2015, New Zealand marked the thirtieth anniversary of the bombing in a more subdued manner than a decade earlier. While there was considerable focus on a rehashing of the French spy drama from a narrow “how we covered it” perspective, there was little introspection or reflection on broader issues of regional security. For example, the sabotage of the environmental flagship was not addressed in the wider context of nuclear-free and independence movements active in New Caledonia, New Zealand’s near Pacific neighbour, or of nuclear refugees such as those from Rongelap Atoll, from where the Rainbow Warrior had relocated an entire community to a safer environment following United States nuclear tests in the Marshall Islands. At the time of the second anniversary, Le Monde exposed the responsibility of President François Mitterrand for Opération Satanique and later revealed much of the detail about the so-called “third team” of bombers. This paper examines the broader context of the bombing in the Pacific geopolitical challenges of the time and the legacy for the region, from a journalist’s perspective, as the region has moved from the insecurity of nuclear refugees to that of climate change refugees, or climate-forced migrants.

Focus groups held with Pacific audiences at several urban centres in New Zealand found that Pacific news media are a key site of Pacific people’s publicness in New Zealand. Audiences looked to Pacific media (and, interestingly, Māori media) to fulfil their expectations for timely, in-depth and high-quality journalism, and for a space in which their communities could safely discuss issues and enact their citizenship. However, it is clear that more could be done to realise this role, not just on the part of Pacific media producers, but also funders and policy makers whose focus on Pacific media in terms of ethnicity and culture tends to overlook audiences’ demand for in-depth news and debate. This paper concludes that viewing ethnic media within categories of ethnicity or culture (as do funders, scholars and, often, media producers) risks both exaggerating the ‘otherness’ of ethnic minority groups and overlooking Pacific audiences’ media needs in terms of their participation in society.

MacArthur’s General Headquarters not only achieved demilitarization and democratization of Japanese society, but also economic growth through decentralization, equalization and liberalization. Military occupations throughout the world have ever since drawn on this Japanese experience.
However, seen from the recent example of Iraq, lessons drawn from Japan have not necessarily been very successful, since the country has not escaped from chaos and instability.
Most academic research in the past has focused on political and economic reforms carried out by General MacArthur. This paper will attempt to emphasize two factors rarely accounted for: 1) attainment of postwar internal security through anti-disturbance measures, and 2) marginalization of the occupation of outlying regions, such as Okinawa. The first factor established the ground for the execution of the better known postwar reforms, and the second factor shows that occupation of some peripheral Japanese areas has been much less successful than has been the case for the mainland.
The results of this research are twofold. That 1) stabilization was not the achievement of the occupier, but rather the result of the conscious efforts by the occupied, and that 2) the occupation of Japan was inextricably linked to the marginalization of Okinawa. In order to be more realistic, the lessons to be drawn from the occupation of Japan should be less focused on the occupation as a U.S. undertaking and should take into consideration important socio-cultural factors.",,,,,"2463-641X",,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/13647","en","Macmillan Brown Centre for Pacific Studies",,"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","CC BY 4.0",,,"The lessons from the post-WW2 occupation of Japan",,,"Journal Article"

Between 1841 and World War I, Tahiti attracted three permanent European Jewish settlers, Tonga three, and Hawai’i perhaps some 100 (typically more transitory) Jewish settlers from both Europe and the U.S. Descendants of these pioneers survive in Tahiti and Tonga as either Christian or New Age; in Hawai’i, however, only four of the early Jewish families have been locally located, each identifying Christian. Yet despite Christian or New Age affiliation, some descendants reveal palpable connection to modern Jewish culture.

Coming at the height of renewed Cold War tensions between the USSR and the West, this unprecedented manoeuvre provoked a significant international uproar and briefly placed Kiribati at the forefront of international geopolitics. Although the Cold War has long since passed, Kiribati‟s Russian gambit remains a unique example of how confronting and impactful small state foreign policy can be, given the right circumstances. Drawing on media reports and academic writing of the day, as well as interviews conducted with relevant officials during 2017 fieldwork in the Pacific, this article offers an analysis of the Kiribati/Soviet fishing pact. It examines the issues – both at home and abroad – which motivated Kiribati to engage with the USSR; the international and domestic reactions to the Government of Kiribati‟s actions; and what occurred in the aftermath of the agreement being signed. Finally, it considers the changing nature of foreign policy in the Pacific in the present day – and suggests that Kiribati‟s 1985 actions provide an insight into what might be seen in Pacific international relations moving forward.",,,,"2463-641X",,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/14904",,"en","Macmillan Brown Centre for Pacific Studies",,"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","CC BY 4.0","small state||Pacific||fisheries||international relations||cold war||Soviet Union||Kiribati",,"When the ‘tuna wars’ went hot:  Kiribati, the Soviet Union, and the fishing pact that provoked a superpower",,,"Journal Article"

In New Caledonia, as in the rest of the world, we are witnessing an extension of the duration of studies. It is important to ascertain that this ―massification of schooling‖ comes hand-in-hand with a reduced correlation between gender and ethnic origin on the one hand and education destiny on the other; in other words, that schooling is being ―qualitatively democratised‖. This study highlights the differences in school achievement between Kanak (indigenous people) and non-Kanak, female and male, as well as a combination of those groups. Using data from the four most recent censuses (1989, 1996, 2009 and 2014), we show that dramatic progress has been made in the area of school achievement; this improvement is particularly marked within the Kanak population. However, at all census dates, there have been fewer Kanak than non-Kanak diploma holders. When using odds ratios, we observe a strong decrease of inequalities in access to education since 1989. However, this decrease has slowed down since 2009, and there is stagnation for the 20- to 30-year-old age group. The general assessment of inequality reduction should therefore be nuanced when focusing in detail on the types of diplomas obtained (in particular the range of higher education diplomas) and on the level thereof (the higher the education level, the greater the inequality).",,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/14900","en","Macmillan Brown Centre for Pacific Studies",,"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","CC BY 4.0","Social and ethnic inequality||school achievement||closing the gap policy||New Caledonia",,"Twenty-five years of inequality-reduction policies in school achievement in New Caledonia",,,"Journal Article"
"18344","10092/13586",,,"Espesor, Jovanie C.",,,,,,"2017",,,"Liberal peacebuilding is the prominent and popular framework employed by intergovernmental organisations and many international non-government organisations in conflict management and resolution in conflictual societies globally. This peacebuilding framework is based on the liberal peace theory, which advances the idea that liberally constituted states are more peaceful in comparison to their illiberal counterparts. With the significant decline of interstate conflicts in the post-Cold War era, IGOs and NGOs shifted their focus and attention to intrastate conflicts in the developing world using the same liberal peacebuilding framework. This paper seeks to explain the process whereby IGOs and NGOs transport, and therefore domesticate, the liberal peace in the context of intrastate conflict in Mindanao—a war-torn region in the southern Philippines. The primary argument of this paper is that the commodification of peace is a strategic mechanism of IGOs and donor agencies to incentivise NGOs in transporting the liberal peace in Mindanao, which has been riven by decades of insurgency conflict and violence. The arguments presented in this paper are drawn from in-depth interviews and ethnographic field observations in conflict-affected communities in the southern Philippines. This paper offers two major contributions. First, it seeks to advance the scholarly understanding of the nexus between liberal democratic peacebuilding and the politics of aid in the context of intrastate conflict. Second, it presents the different ontological and empirical referents of the domestic variants of the liberal peace theory, which are embedded in the activities of NGOs in Mindanao.",,,,"2463-641X",,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/14899","en","Macmillan Brown Centre for Pacific Studies",,"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","CC BY 4.0","NGO||foreign aid||Mindanao||peacebuilding||liberal peace",,"Domesticating by commodifying the liberal peace?

It’s a great pleasure to be here today. I want to say vinaka vaka levu and thank Professor Steven Ratuva for inviting me to speak. I have been asked to cover one of the great challenges of our region: The Future of Pacific Regionalism. More specifically, I’ve been asked to speak on the challenges and prospects for regionalism.
Regionalism has always been a goal of Pacific leaders, yet somehow the benefits have been elusive. The regionalism theme in the Pacific is not new. In the 1970s one of my predecessors at the Pacific Community, Dr Macu Salato of Fiji, defined Pacific regionalism as “unity in diversity” – recognising the region’s rich diversity of geography, cultures, and so on, and many common interests and challenges – not least the shared resource of the Pacific Ocean.
The Pacific Islands region is one of contrast – from Papua New Guinea with more than seven million people, to Niue and Tokelau, each with populations under two thousand. It is clear that development potential varies considerably, along with the capacity and capability of Pacific Island Countries and Territories (PICTs).
First, let me tell you a little about the Secretariat of the Pacific Community (SPC)–an organisation that I now have the honour of leading.",,,"2463-641X",,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/14977",,"en","Macmillan Brown Centre for Pacific Studies",,"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","CC BY 4.0",,,"The future of Pacific regionalism: Challenges and prospects",,,"Journal Article"
