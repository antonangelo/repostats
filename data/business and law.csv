various groundwater problems. We show how to use MODMAN to create an LP suitable for sustainable water trading. The LP includes required environmental conditions (e.g., head levels, flow to streams) as constraints, guaranteeing sustainability. The objective is to maximize consumer surplus. The objective coefficients are taken from users' bids to buy/sell from their water allocation, ensuring that no water users lose from the auction. Our approach implies an institutional arrangement for a water market in which a regional agency acts as a broker for a given catchment. Users bid for water through a web page, thus virtually eliminating transaction costs. The agency then solves the LP, which gives the optimal prices and allocations.

In seeking to understand almost any aspect of taxation, we need to bear in mind that it is much more than the study of the revenue law itself. For example, legal researchers may be well qualified to study the meaning of the letter of the law, but find that they are not quite so equipped to study how people respond to the law.   This paper focuses on the issues that arose from a single case study researching into the life of Mr J G Russell, the creator of New Zealand’s most prolific tax avoidance template that has led to over three decades of litigation.
Looking forward, the tax affairs of Mr Russell are in their final stages, with bankruptcy likely. Mr Russell was a guest at the University of Canterbury on two occasions, the purpose primarily being for the recording of in-depth interviews capturing his life story. Looking backwards it appears that the capturing of this narrative history was timely as it has been reported that Mr Russell has the onset of dementia.  Mr Russell also addressed our students by way of seminar on both Christchurch visits, a unique experience for both cohorts. The duration of research spanned over three years and again a relationship can develop with a research subject, in particular seeing them in a way vastly different to that portrayed in the media and by Inland Revenue.
One observation is that Mr Russell is caught in a tax avoidance time warp, as reflected in the Challenge case, and unable to accept judicial interpretation of tax avoidance law has moved on.
The issues that arose from this study included validation of data presented by Mr Russell, and being aware of researcher bias developing over time.  In addition the research raised issues around future availability of material as the final study had to be redacted indefinitely.",,,,"Hodson, A.

"14348","10092/161","Maples, A.J.||Karlinsky, S.",,,,,,,"2015",,"Political commentators have long said that the enactment of a comprehensive capital gains tax (CGT) in New Zealand (NZ) would be political suicide.  However, sentiment towards a CGT in NZ has softened more recently with a number of commentators as well as business and political leaders supporting the introduction of a CGT. 
In both the 2011 and 2014 General Elections the centre-left Labour Party campaigned on inter alia introducing a comprehensive CGT levied at a rate of 15 per cent. They lost in both elections but on the basis that a CGT is now clearly part of the NZ political agenda of the left-of-centre parties coupled with the current mixed member proportional (MMP) electoral system (which lends itself to coalition-based governments) it is arguably only a matter of time before a CGT is introduced in NZ by a Labour-led coalition.
This paper, using Adam Smith’s canons for a good income tax, considers the Labour Party CGT proposal and the United States (US) experience in dealing with capital gains. It notes that the NZ proposals are consistent with CGT regimes generally, such as it being realisation-based and not permitting indexing, but may involve complexities and pitfalls that the US system has previously encountered.",,,,"Maples, A.J., Karlinsky, S.

Methodology – The arena framework developed by Renn (1992) and applied to accountability research by Georgakopoulos and Thomson (2008) is implemented and developed, and informed by interviews with key actors in the arena.
Findings –Actors perceive accountability for risk to come down to process. Accountability for risk is about providing an account for actions, past, present and future; a forum to debate this account; and a consideration of the Other in decision making. It was also found that diverse understandings of responsibility, including the Māori guardianship value of kaitiakitanga, can inform decision-making and challenge existing interpretations of corporate and public responsibility.
Originality/value – Aotearoa New Zealand is a country built around an official ‘partnership’ arrangement between the Government of New Zealand and Māori, and exploring this provides unique insights for accountability relationships. This is enhanced by examining a novel and controversial activity, deep sea petroleum exploration. The ability to participate in decision-making, the forum for the account, was more important for actors than the account itself. This research has also given ‘voice’ to actors not often considered in accounting research and policy-making and has thus uncovered a novel understanding of ‘accountability for risk’ in a conflict arena.",,,,"Scobie, M., Milne, M., Love, T.

It is a journey worth recounting because it reveals how starkly our administrative law has changed over a short, finite period of time.  The transformative nature of this change beguiled some into believing that judicial review was a strictly post-war phenomenon.  This was palpably not so; judicial review has an absorbing history reaching back to the early jurisdiction of the Court of King’s Bench.
This article critiques nine judicially-constructed dichotomies that dominated administrative law following the war.  These dichotomies were fixed and unforgiving, portraying administrative law as rigorous and analytical.  They lent respectability to a subject that naturally spawned suspicion.  Senior judges denounced the subject as “Continental jargon”  and the work of “academicians”.   The irony is that the dichotomies employed to invigorate the subject were transparently false.

volumes growing by over 350% over the last decade. However, as trade steadily increases, so does the discrepancy
between China’s reported exports and New Zealand’s reported imports, and vice versa. Trade data discrepancies are not
a phenomenon unique to China and New Zealand and extensive research has been carried out into what causes
differences to arise. Explanations particularly relevant to the China-New Zealand case are transshipment (re-exporting
through Hong Kong is common practice in China) and intentional mis-invoicing for tax evasion purposes (China’s VAT
system incentivises under-reporting of exports). China is known for having abnormally large discrepancies in its export
data compared to its partners’ import data, with exports undervalued relative to imports, and understanding how and why
these discrepancies emerge is important. Major trade mis-invoicing could signal de facto capital account openness or
corruption, and has implications for the accuracy of customs data.
In this paper we examine the full extent of the discrepancy between New Zealand’s and China’s reported trade figures.
Using HS 6-digit trade data and tariff data from New Zealand Customs Service we examine industry- and goods-level
patterns in the discrepancies and provide an explanation for why these discrepancies exist in the New Zealand setting.
After controlling for CIF-FOB measurement differences and misattribution due to re-exporting, we consider whether tariff
rates, China’s VAT and capital control policies, or transfer pricing are driving trade misinvoicing between New Zealand

"14373","10092/161","Sawyer, A.J.",,,,,,,"2015",,"New Zealand (NZ) has taken a path towards tax simplification with respect to individual taxpayers who are not involved in business or self-employed, since the mid-1980s, following the election of the Fourth Labour Government in 1984.  The governing principle has been to enhance efficiency and reduce complexity from the perspective of the NZ Government and Inland Revenue, while placing less weight on potential equity issues.  This has seen the removal of deductions for wage and salary earners, the removal of the need to file returns (accompanied by personal tax summaries) for those with income taxed at source, and formalising self-assessment.  For individuals who are in business or self-employed, the drive more recently has been to reduce their compliance costs following significant tax reform since 1984, while retaining their ability to claim deductions.  This differential approach has placed greater emphasis on the employee versus self-employed distinction.  Going forward, Inland Revenue, in conjunction with the NZ Government, is embarking on the largest IT-focussed project in NZ’s history – the Business Transformation Programme – that is intended to take tax administration well into the 21st Century.  Further simplification, greater withholding accuracy, and an online environment as the primary interface between Inland Revenue and taxpayers, are key themes.  Thus like the Peoples Republic of China (PRC), NZ is undertaking significant reform of the way individuals will engage with, and meet, their tax obligations","Keynote Presentation",,,"Sawyer, A.J.

Therefore it is crucial to understand more thoroughly the communication roles and responsibilities of interagency team members and to examine how individual members communicate within a complex, evolving, and unstable environment. It is also important to understand how different organisational identities and their spatial geographies contribute to the interactional dynamics. Earthquakes hit the Canterbury region on September, 2010 and then on February 2011 a more devastating shallow earthquake struck resulting in severe damage to the Aged Residential Care (ARC) sector. Over 600 ARC beds were lost and 500 elderly and disabled people were displaced. Canterbury District Health Board (CDHB) set up an interagency emergency response team to address the issues of vulnerable people with significant health and disability needs who were unable to access their normal supports due to the effects of the earthquake. The purpose of this qualitative interpretive study is to focus on the case study of the response and evacuation of vulnerable people by interagencies responding to the event. Staff within these agencies were interviewed with a focus on the critical incidents that either stabilised or negatively influenced the outcome of the response. The findings included the complexity of navigating multiple agencies communication channels; understanding the different hierarchies and communication methods within each agency; data communication challenges when infrastructures were severely damaged; the importance of having the right skills, personal attributes and understanding of the organisations in the response; and the significance of having a liaison in situ representing and communicating through to agencies geographically dispersed from Canterbury.

Studies in the academic literature, however, reach conflicting conclusions concerning which measure of inflation a central bank should target in a small open economy. This paper examines the properties of domestic, CPI, and real-exchange- rate-adjusted (REX) inflation targeting. In one class of open economy New Keynesian models there is an isomorphism between optimal monetary policy in an open versus closed economy. In the type of model we consider, where the real exchange rate appears in the Phillips curve, this isomorphism breaks down; openness matters. REX inflation targeting restores the isomorphism but this may not be desirable. Instead, under domestic and CPI inflation targeting the exchange rate channel can be exploited to enhance the effects of monetary policy. Our results indicate that CPI inflation targeting can deliver price stability across the three inflation objectives and will be desirable to a central bank with a high aversion to inflation instability. REX inflation targeting does well in delivering output stability and has a relative advantage in economies where demand shocks are predominant. In general, the choice of the inflation objective affects the trade-offs between policy goals and thus policy choices and outcomes.",,,,"Froyen, R.T., Guender, A.V. (2013) What to Aim For?

The paper has outlined the law of redundancy as it has developed over time, as well as providing an overview of the law of directors’ duties.   The paper finds that in recent redundancy cases under s 103A of the ERA, a sea-change has occurred in respect of the nature of the analysis applied by the Courts to the substantive element of an employer’s redundancy decision.   The level of scrutiny is now heightened, and in particular employers are required to present detailed financial evidence to justify their actions in terms of s 103A.   This new approach, it is argued, makes it more difficult for an employer to run its business in accordance with its management obligations, but at the same time appears to lack any properly-developed policy foundation and is problematic as a matter of statutory interpretation.   The paper concludes by suggesting that the Courts should therefore return to their earlier approach to redundancy decisions, which focussed primarily on procedural fairness and applied a test of genuineness to the substantive element.   There is ample scope for the good faith requirements in s 4 of the ERA to guide the Courts’ interpretation of s 103A so as to resolve the tension between the competing interests in future redundancy cases.",,,,"Holderness, H., Schofield, S.

"15247","10092/161",,"Mills, Colleen||Winstone, K.",,,,,,"2010",,"Objectives: The literature on brand-led new business ventures is extremely scant (Merrilees, 2007). Typically entrepreneurs have a product or service concept that drives their enterprise development initiative. Corporate branding follows business establishment rather than leads it. This paper tells the story of an enterprise development that radically deviates from this conventional approach. It profiles a thriving New Zealand business that had its genesis in a corporate brand concept. The paper’s objective is to present this company’s unique corporate brand development approach and show how it provides a template for SME startup that could contribute greatly to their chances of long-term success.
Prior Work: The concept of brand-led startup is largely absent from the SME startup literature. This business startup case study is unique and represents the only known empirical study of its sort.
Approach: This study involved semi-structured interviews with internal and external stakeholder groups (e.g., business founders, customers and suppliers) of a highly successful brand-oriented New Zealand company in order to produce a comprehensive profile of its founders’ brand development strategy. The qualitative data from these interviews were used to develop a conceptual model of his development strategy This model was then contrasted with the most widely used models of business start-up and corporate branding referred to in the entrepreneurship literature. From this analysis implications of the emergent model for SME start-up were identified.
Results: This paper presents Icebreaker’s corporate branding model which, while sharing features with Urde’s (2003) model, is distinguished in ways that have significant relevance for those starting SMEs. It positions ideology rather than market opportunity at the heart of the brand development process and shows how brand development can integrate all aspects of enterprise creation. In so doing it proposes a fundamental shift in thinking which enterprise development thinking.
Implications: The model, by positioning a corporate branding ideology rather than market opportunity at the heart of entrepreneurship, represents a new way of thinking about enterprise development that encourages an integrated approach and gives new businesses advantages over their established competitors.
Value: Firstly, this paper challenges conventional views of business start-up by revealing a distinctive business development model. In so doing, it makes a valuable contribution to both the corporate branding and SME startup literatures. Secondly, the model it presents promises to be a valuable template for guiding new businesses development in a way that leads to robust and competitive corporate brands.",,,,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/12693",,"en",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Field of Research::15 - Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services::1503 - Business and Management::150304 - Entrepreneurship||Field of Research::15 - Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services::1503 - Business and Management::150314 - Small Business Management||Field of Research::15 - Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services::1505 - Marketing::150506 - Marketing Theory",,,"brand-led business start-up||entrepreneurial ideology||corporate branding||SMEs",,,,"Brand new: A case of brand-led business start-up","Conference Contributions - Published",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Whilst not all activity occurring here is subject to particular international legal instruments, most is. A cluster of Antarctic-specific instruments, comprising the 1959 Antarctic Treaty, 1972 Convention for
the Conservation of Antarctic Seals (CCAS), 1980 Convention on the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR) and 1991 Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty
(Protocol), form what is termed ‘the Antarctic Treaty System’ (ATS) and address a large part of present activity. Whaling and harvesting of Southern blue-fin tuna are regulated under the 1946 International Convention for the Regulation of Whaling (ICRW) through its International Whaling
Commission (IWC), and the 1993 Convention for the Conservation of Southern Blue-fin Tuna (CCSBT) through its Commission respectively, legal instruments that are external to the Antarctic Treaty System.
Other high seas activities in the region are subject to the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS).
Modern integrated environmental management approaches are largely confined to only two of these six instruments - CCAMLR and the Protocol. The obligation for prior Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA), one of the major tools deployed in modern environmental management globally, is
confined to the latter. EIA obligations in the Protocol are coupled with the advance notice obligations of Article VII.5.a of the Antarctic Treaty. Although EIA has been applied to national Antarctic
programmes and tourism activities, as a matter of state practice this has (drawing on a number of considerations) generally excluded EIA application to any whaling or fishing activities (although there
are exceptions in relation to one state). States active in the region, whatever their positions on whaling and the modalities of other marine harvesting, have generally resisted calls to broaden the range of
activities subject to EIA.
This paper documents the basis for EIA within the Antarctic Treaty System, examines the arguments that have been used to deny its applicability to the wider range of Antarctic activities, enquires into the
exceptions, considers the place of EIA in the context of the declaratory positions of Antarctic-active states in relation to ecosystem maintenance and environmental and other use values, and suggests
mechanisms whereby some broadening of EIA coverage might be achieved if the political will existed.",,,,"Hemmings, A., Scott, K.N., Rogan-Finnemore, M.

This process would lead to a European Union Constitution upon which to base future development of the Union. The rejection of the Constitutional Treaty which eventually emerged from the Laeken Process at the hands of the French electorate and their Dutch compatriots thus marks and equally serious reversal for those with such high hopes for this document.

The failure of the Constitutional Treaty is more than a mere rejection of a European Treaty. This has happened before, both after Maastrict and Amsterdam, but the rejection of the Constitutional Treaty in core Union states marked a crisis not only in terms of this treaty but in the confidence in the European project as a whole. For the first time since 1957, the onward march of the European regionalisation process was clearly and unmistakably halted by the populace of its Member States. Their had been warnings before and rocky times along the way but this event, public as it was, could not be wished away by any amount of spin or political manoeuvring. The people had been allowed to speak and their voices were an unmistakable Non or Nej. 

However, although the failure of the Constitutional Treaty is clearly a fundamental problem for the continuing development of the Union it also has significant implications beyond Europe's borders. The success of the Union and the realisation that the same drivers that brought the Union's Member States together in 1957 apply increasingly to nation-states across the globe has led to interest in and the creation of international regional organisations in every populated continent. From the NAFTA agreement, to the CER via the Andes Community, nascent regional organisations are now the rule rather than the exception. Such developments are now to be seen taking shape in East Asia. The European Union, however, has had more of a role than merely convincing other regions of the advantages of regional co-operation, its success has led to its development being seen as a model for others.

This paper examines this phenomenon in the light of the crisis that currently affects the Union in the wake of the TCE's demise. The crisis of confidence that now afflicts the EU gives significant food for thought to those countries considering regional cooperation in their own corners of the world. What does the failure of the ECT mean for European model of regionalism? Is the European model such a success after all?",,,,"Hopkins, W.J.

suspicion that teachers and bureaucrats are motivated by self-interest rather than the
public good). The ability of Economics to ‘colonise’ education appears to echo

"1301","10092/161","Leane, G.W.G.",,,,,,,"2005",,"The ‘socio-legal’ has always been a vigorously contested space in International
Law theory. The ‘legal’ has been consigned to near-irrelevance by realist international relations theory on the one hand, and lauded as a remarkable achievement of modernity on the other – a civilising enterprise aspiring to the preservation of peace by the State under the rule of law.
The instrumental role of International Law in achieving the peace is now being reoriented by liberal institutionalists such as Anne Marie Slaughter. This theory
postulates a regime of international, or at least transnational, law formulation
through the interaction of networks of non-state actors such as domestic courts,
regulatory agencies, executives, NGO’s and other discursive communities. There is
a ‘thicker’, more diverse set of international relations which erodes the sovereignty of State from without and within. Globalisation can be characterised as a context and a vehicle for this new liberal-cosmopolitan project. The theory is not limited to procedural innovation, however, for it carries within it the specific telos of liberal internationalism, or in its strongest form a liberal millenarianism which aspires to
something like a Kantian peace in an expanding zone of liberal law.
If there is an ongoing tension in International Law theory between the theory and the practice then this new liberal institutionalist approach at least has the virtue of claiming to describe practice. However, its teleological claim must bear closer scrutiny from perspectives of both theory and practice. Is it really ‘new’ or just a light shone more brightly on old practices? Is there such a fundamental shift as to amount to a disaggregation of the State and an undermining of the centrality of the State in the global order? Do these networks represent something authentically
‘liberal’ or are they merely opaque, unaccountable, self-selecting elites? Are they really just a kind of vulgar interest-group liberalism or do they represent an
embryonic civil society? Finally, can or even should liberalism make any claim to
a post-historical space that leaves the non-liberal world mired in ideological
backwaters?",,,,"Leane, G.W.G. (2005) Socio-legal currents in International Law Theory.

However we need first to consider the New Zealand to which he was returning. 
This was a New Zealand which was enjoying renewed prosperity after the long depression of the 1890s, with very substantial population growth through migration and natural increase, and not a little proud of its status as a laboratory for social and political reform.  It is the era of Richard Seddon – “King Dick”  and the beginning of “God’s own country” – but even more it is the country working through the effects of great social and political experiments – female suffrage, inaugurating  a system of industrial conciliation and arbitration, and the being the first state to grant to its older citizens [at least those not of Asian descent] an old age pension. These developments all reflect a strong belief in many quarters of society  in an activist state rather than individualism.  Other social issues remained in contention – especially the question of control of the liquor trade and whether majorities of citizens should be able to enforce prohibition within their districts.

Such reflection should also improve how learners perform accounting work and how they continue learning how to perform accounting work. This study draws on the experiences in a university setting for four months in 2008 of fifty learners and two learning facilitators who elected to collaborate in a course involving management accounting learning. Using data amassed through participant-observation, action research, course records, group learning and assessment outputs, assessment scripts and course evaluation questionnaires completed by students, the two facilitators analyse various aspects of the learning, including its design, structure, process, assessment and evaluation. This analysis includes matters of wicked competences in learning outcomes; implementing learner-centred learning, including group interaction; using instructional cases and case-study research articles in an active way; the two facilitators working as a team inside as well as outside the formal learning space; the facilities available for learning having to be worked around to provide formal learning space; a virtual learning environment emerging supported by Blackboard; using group assessment to award individual grades, including having group members assess each other’s contributions confidentially; and using seen questions in an otherwise conventional final examination.
Findings indicate that the learners had little exposure to collaborative learning before engaging in the experience on which the study focuses. The learning method in the course did not suit everyone. Those it did suit found it refreshing, and those it did not chose alternative courses, or were critical in their course evaluations. Many learners reported that the learning and its assessment inspired them to change their ways of studying. These ways had certain novelty values, opened up opportunities for networking, and were in line with things they expect to be doing when they are in practice.

Against this background this paper examines recent judicial trends in New Zealand as evident in two 2006 cases to ascertain what guidance they provide in this complex area. The first, a decision of the New Zealand Court of Appeal, concerned the tax treatment of legal expenses incurred by the taxpayer in unsuccessfully seeking compensation arising from alleged unlawful acts or omissions in the course of a tender process the taxpayer was involved in (Fullers Bay of Islands Ltd v CIR). The overall approach of the New Zealand High Court in this case is also very instructive. At issue in the second case, TRA Case W26, was whether expenditure incurred in earthquake strengthening a building was deductible. These cases provide guidance on a number of issues including the continuing use of the fixed and circulating capital test; the use of the accounting treatment adopted; the impact regulatory requirements have on deductibility and the manner in which work is undertaken (including the issue of deferred maintenance).",,,,"Maples, A.J.

individuals and tertiary graduates. Haylock (2005), observing that 80% of accounting
firms are finding it difficult to find and retain good staff, asked, “Where have all the
accountants gone?” Hooks (2005) replied, “Overseas, especially to the UK [United
Kingdom] and Australia”. Her reply was based on a survey of Kiwi expatriate
business professionals (also reported in Inkson et al., 2004; Jackson et al., 2005;
Hooks et al., 2005). This study extends their findings by surveying potential
accountants before they leave New Zealand (NZ).
This survey of 177 accounting students in their third or fourth year of study found that
87% of the respondents intend to work overseas, especially in the UK and Australia.
The reasons provided for intending to work overseas were heavily weighted towards
higher incomes, developing their careers and having fun. This loss of graduates
should be a concern for accounting firms, as it will add to the shortage of entry level
accountants. Accounting firms may need to look outside NZ for skilled labour and
may need to take advantage of international students already in NZ. Overall, there
does not seem to be an end in sight to the brain drain of young accountants from NZ.
NZ will continue to lose trained accountants to the UK and Australia and increasingly
to other countries until we are able to offer them higher incomes and career
opportunities.
Responses suggest that students will eventually return to NZ for family and lifestyle
reasons, although these are less influential for students than for the expatriates in
Hooks et al. (2005). However, NZ is attractive for its safety.. Return of the students
could lead to a brain gain as suggested by Inkson et al. (1997) where expatriates
return bringing new skills, knowledge and capital.
Until long-term strategies of economic growth can be put in place, firms will have to
deal with the skills shortage in two ways: firstly, through attracting skilled workers
from overseas, this could be achieved in part through retaining international students
through the provision of work permits. Secondly, firms can build loyalty in order to
retain current staff, as suggested by Boress (1999) and Haylock (2005). Thirdly, NZ
needs long-term strategies of investment in technology to grow the economy as
implemented by other countries such as India (Cervantes and Guellec, 2002).",,,,"Pengelly, R., Lord, B., Shanahan, Y. (2008) The Accounting Brain Drain.

ADF unit root test and familiar causality test using unique highest frequency energy price
data sets (ten-day interval spot prices). Meanwhile the paper has estimated the rates at
which relative prices converge to their long-run values and observed the flow of energy
price between cities. The major findings are as follow:
First of all, both common ADF unit root test and panel unit root test have shown that
gasoline and diesel markets are fundamentally integrated because almost all tests reject
unit root hypothesis. Taking into some special and remote cities (some western and
southwestern small cities, such as Lhasa, Wulumuqi, Guiyang and Lanzhou), it may be
safe to conclude that gasoline and diesel markets are fairly integrated. This finding is
consistent with international literatures (Fan and Wei, 2006; Panagiotidis and Emilie,
2007).
Although all tests disclose that coal and electricity markets in mainland China seem
not well integrated as gasoline and diesel markets, this may be most partly due to bulk of
coal and non-storability of electricity and power network disconnection. As a
consequence, panel unit root tests rejected null hypothesis, which may imply that coal
and electricity markets in Mainland China are still quite integrated as a whole.
Second, there are not any significant intercept terms, electricity prices empirically
and theoretically converge to absolute price parity due to no more transportation cost
once started. However, coal and gasoline prices more likely converge to their relative
price parities due partly to significant transportation cost.
Third, the rates at which relative prices converge to their long-run values are very
close between each relative price series within the same energy product and also fairy
short compared with those internationally.
Fourth, there are rich causality relationships between cities for coal and electricity.
Causality not only originates from supply cities but from demand cities as well.",,,,"Ma, H., Oxley, L., Gibson J. (2007) Energy Market Integration in China.

"13991","10092/161","Gunby, P.||Jin, Y.",,,,,,,"2015",,"From 1982 onwards, the Chinese State Council and the National People’s Congress have had a standing policy of reducing the size of the public sector of the Chinese economy. The aim of this policy is to increase the share of Chinese economic activity that is conducted in the market sector. The reasoning behind this policy is that resources that are controlled by the public sector are used relatively inefficiently, impeding Chinese economic growth. 
	Several attempts have been made to reduce the Chinese public sector since 1982. Most regard these previous efforts as having been unsuccessful.  This suggests that general economic and social factors may be determining the size of the Chinese public sector. A better understanding of these factors could enable the Chinese government to implement policies that have a greater chance of success.  
	Accordingly, this paper will study the factors associated with the size of the public sector at the level of Chinese provinces. We will use Leamer’s Extreme Bounds Analysis (Leamer, 1985, 2008) to identify robust correlates with public sector size. Explanatory variables include provincial income, share of the population that is working, urbanisation, and ethnic diversity. Policy variables of particular interest include fiscal decentralisation, the “flypaper effect” (i.e., the importance of central government fiscal transfers to provinces), and the previously unexplored factor of the degree of corruption across provinces. Significance of the latter variable would give added support to the Chinese government for it’s current policy of reducing corruption by government officials.",,,,"Gunby, P., Jin, Y.

Late in the course, many students stated that they urgently needed the system for revision, but even fewer used it. At the same time, lecture attendance appeared to be lower than normal.

electricity in New Zealand, the approach would accept bids for the purchase or sale of water, and then
find the water allocations that optimise the economic benefit to society.
The approach uses a number of constraints on optimisation reflecting the physical limits to water
availability, and also reflecting environmental objectives. The latter can include a minimum stream
flow constraint and a maximum drawdown constraint to limit seawater intrusion. Unlike other water
trading approaches, this approach does not require negotiating and evaluating a series of transfers
between pairs of users; instead, the approach can consider all water users and their unique needs
simultaneously, while ensuring environmental compatibility. The research is advancing along three
lines: (1) investigation of the level of model sensitivity and its effects on the operation of the market,
(2) study of the potential methods of operation of the model (e.g., 'user-pays', 'user-trades', user cooperative),

The relationship between the yields on these various securities is the province of the term structure of interest rates literature which has a long history and can be traced-back formally to Keynes.
With the popularity of cointegration and VAR/SVAR approaches to estimation in econometrics, a separate literature using these approaches to estimate and test term structure models and implications has developed.
Here the papers are typically motivated by a concern to understand the term structure for the related monetary policy control issues and focus either upon technical estimation issues and often the validity of inferences derived including, importantly, causal inference, the effects of structural change or the testing of various hypotheses. Causality is a particularly important and popular issue given the role of monetary policy intervention.
In this paper we wish to add a significant extra dimension to the debate by using graphical modelling to identify causal mechanisms within multivariate time series models.
This paper considers an application to the term structure of interest rates where little consensus seems to exist on the causal nexus and direction between long and short rates of interest. In particular, there are three alternative views on causality; short rates cause long rates (broadly the traditional Expectations Hypothesis view); long rates cause short rates (here rational inflation expectations have a role); or the market segmentation, or preferred habitat approaches, where causality is discontinuous across maturity periods. The outcome in an empirical sense will be crucial for the efficacy of monetary policy design and implementation.",,,,"Oxley, L., Reale, M., Tunnicliffe-Wilson, G.

Design/methodology/approach: Utilises an exploratory case study, including interviews with senior staff and an analysis of University reports and plans.
Findings: Related sustainability activities have been implemented on a small scale, take a long time to become established, and are driven by a few concerned staff. Some aspects of environmental performance, such as electricity consumption, waste removal, fuel consumption and air travel miles, are measured and recorded, suggesting that the EMA information is systematically generated. However, EMA data are not reported on or compared to goals or targets. Interviewees, however, favoured the idea of EMA to communicate environmental performance, provide targets for comparison and enable better long-term decisions.
Practical implications: There is significant potential for developing EMA at the University of Canterbury, but the concept is not well understood and therefore is unlikely to be an organising concept for systems development. EMA is a useful starting point for the University’s purported, but unrealised, commitment to sustainability reporting. Existing information systems could produce EMA information, but codes would have to be disaggregated and more software would be needed.

Throughput Accounting (TA) (Noreen et al, 1995; Dugdale & Jones, 1998; Jones
& Dugdale, 1998), to date there has been a paucity of published studies of TA.
This paper argues that TA, and the production management system it supports –
the Theory of Constraints (TOC) are fads/fashions in accordance with
Abrahamson’s (1996) framework and posits that negative connotations regarding
the term fads/fashions along with the likening of management fads/fashions to
aesthetic fads/fashions could be likely reasons for the lack of scholarly interest
from accounting researchers. Furthermore, this paper extends the management
fads/fashions literature by extending the debate to include accounting academics
and research networks. It is argued that accounting researchers, accounting
research agendas and accounting research networks can be deemed to be
fads/fashions as they exhibit many of the characteristics of management
fads/fashions including, lifecycles, rhetoric and gurus. Such a classification
however, does not rule out the potential for theoretically sound scholarly research,
rather it widens the opportunities for researchers.
This paper demonstrates empirically that TA is a topic worthy of inclusion in
research agendas. TOC implementation causes several changes to management
control systems and uses accounting information as the primary method of
production scheduling. In addition, operational staff in firms with TOC use
accounting information to plan and manage their work on a daily basis. Firms
with TOC change the way they measure and evaluate performance as well as
include throughput information in their capital budgeting processes. It is argued
that a firm which implements TOC will change its Management Control System
particularly in relation to overhead allocation and the dissemination of financial
information to all levels of the firm. These changes are driven by an apparent
paradigm shift in operational thinking by managers and staff of firms that have
implemented TOC. Furthermore these changes are significant enough to warrant
further investigation into TA and the processes relating to management control
system change. This paper concludes with some suggestions for future research
and poses some challenges to accounting scholars.",,,,"Jackman, S.M. (2008) Innovations in management accounting research and practice: Whatever happened to Throughput Accounting?.

for risk in the deep sea petroleum exploration arena of Aotearoa New Zealand.
Methodology – The arena framework developed by Renn (1992) and applied to accountability
research by Georgakopoulos and Thomson (2008) is implemented and developed, and informed by
interviews with key actors in the arena.
Findings –Actors perceive accountability for risk to come down to process. Accountability for risk
is about providing an account for actions, past, present and future; a forum to debate this account;
and a consideration of the Other in decision making. It was also found that diverse understandings
of responsibility, including the Māori guardianship value of kaitiakitanga, can inform decision making
and challenge existing interpretations of corporate and public responsibility.
Originality/value – Aotearoa New Zealand is a country built around an official ‘partnership’
arrangement between the Government of New Zealand and Māori, and exploring this provides
unique insights for accountability relationships. This is enhanced by examining a novel and
controversial activity, deep sea petroleum exploration. The ability to participate in decision-making,
the forum for the account, was more important for actors than the account itself. This research has
also given ‘voice’ to actors not often considered in accounting research and policy-making and has
thus uncovered a novel understanding of ‘accountability for risk’ in a conflict arena.",,,,"Scobie, M.R., Milne, M.J., Love, T. (2016) It might never happen, or will it?

While a few companies produced social and/or environmental reports in the early 1990s, and the practice diffused a little during the 2000s, New Zealand remains an outlier with the vast bulk of New Zealand’s largest organisations still not producing such reports. Early commentators noted that the practice was “desperately seeking volunteers” (Gilkison, 1998) and with reporting rates languishing the practice was still considered to be “starting behind” by the KPMG international surveys in 2011, 2013 and 2015.
This study aims to gain insights into why reporting has not flourished in New Zealand, despite its early start, and despite considerable efforts on the part of not only those few organisations that have reported, but also other business intermediaries dedicated to promoting sustainable business practices including reporting. We map the sustainable business field and identify influential players. We undertake semi-structured interviews with two Chief Executives of New Zealand sustainable business intermediaries (SBIs) and with senior managers of eleven of their reporting and non-reporting members. We use neo-institutional theory (NIT) to frame and analyse our findings.
We find that reporting rationales identified in the literature and promoted by the business intermediaries both motivate and cause resistance to reporting. Reporting seems far from an inevitable outcome for organisations engaging with sustainability in New Zealand, and while the SBIs appear to facilitate weak isomorphic pressure, the absence of any coercive pressure from either them or other external forces such as the Government suggests social and environmental reporting seems set to remain a practice undertaken by few.",,,,"Wright, H., Milne, M.J., Tregidga, H.

Using hypothetical ESOs, we show that ESO cost is extremely sensitive to employee characteristics, thereby casting doubt on the usefulness of any market-based model.

more developed colony with an existing institutional base of courts and of
inherited and local law, it provides an unusual opportunity to obtain a picture

This paper focuses on civil litigation in the Supreme Court of New Zealand,
the superior court of record, and is based primarily on archival records
available in Christchurch, particularly the Supreme Court Minute Book,
supplemented by other archival material and by contemporary newspaper
reports. The termination date of the study, around the end of September
1861, is dictated by changes in the recording of matters before the Supreme
Court, under which very many fewer details are entered into the Minute Book.
I must begin with a caveat that this paper does not attempt at all to deal with
all cases before the courts in Canterbury – there is clearly a substantial body
of disputes which were heard in the lower courts which fall outside the

The term itself refers to a level of process capability. Sigma (s) is the Greek alphabet equivalent of the letter s, and is used to denote standard deviation in statistics. Any group of values resulting from a numerically-based process measurement activity will have an average or mean value (s) denoting its 'centre', and a standard deviation (s) denoting its degree of inherent variability. Standard deviation is itself a measure of the accumulated differences between a group of values and their average. Traditional quality control theory has always held that having the upper or lower specification limits for a product or component equate to three standard deviations from the mean for the process would result in acceptably low levels of nonconforming product (66,807 defects per million opportunities, or 6.7% of production, assuming that processes are subject to disturbances that could cause the process mean to shift by as much as 1.5 standard deviations off the target). In Six Sigma thinking, the process is improved to the extent that specification limits lie six standard deviations from the process mean, and thereby achieve 3.4 defects per million opportunities (or 0.00034% of production). Figure 1 compares the two situations graphically. The means to achieving this level of performance are through application of a collection of long standing management and statistical tools, systemically applied within a cycle of improvement known as DMAIC (standing for Define - Measure - Analyse - Improve - Control).",,,,"Grigg, N., Pulakanam, V.

"2466","10092/161","Webb, D.",,,,,,,"2007",,"This paper has sought to show that the current framework of professional regulation
is unlikely to change in a significant way any time soon. While reforms in some
jurisdictions have been hailed or criticised as altering the foundations of the legal
profession, it is the view of this author that nothing of substance has changed. Any
meaningful change to the regulation of the legal profession faces significant barriers.
These barriers are largely structural and do not presuppose that lawyers are
necessarily obstructing or opposing change in any concerted or organised way.
Changes to date have left the profession substantially in control of its own regulation
and discipline although in some cases formal power has been placed in the hands of
independent third parties. Such change is incremental, peripheral, and does not alter
the reality of lawyercentric
regulation.
My argument is simply that given who lawyers are, what they do, and the natural
inclination to self interest, regulation is difficult at best, and arguably impossible to
achieve in any meaningful way. The nature of lawyers work means that most of
what they do is never open to scrutiny and client are either motivated to be
complicit in wrongdoing, or have good reasons not to complain. In the event that a
complaint is made the issue is generally framed in terms of whether the lawyer has
breached professional standards. Those standards are drafted and interpreted by
lawyers who are sympathetic to the vicissitudes of legal practice and are wary of
imposing unduly onerous duties on their fellows.",,,,"Webb, D. (2007) Are Lawyers Regulateable?.

Part of a liquidator's primary duty is to realise the assets of the company, those assets including, of course, causes of action that the company may have against its directors.  Additionally, on liquidation, other specified actions that may be taken against company directors accrue to the liquidator.  What, if any, action a company is able to take against its directors will form part of the administrator's report sent to creditors of a compay in administration prior to the watershed meeting and may well have an impact on the decision made by the creditors at the watershed meeting.  Both an administrator and a liquidator have a duty to notify the Registrar if they suspect directors have committed offences under specified legislation including the Companies Act 1993, the Securities Act 1978 and the Securities Market Act 1978.
However, despite the apparent breadth of the title of this paper, I have been asked to focus on two particular aspects of directors' liability on insolvency.

We use the theory of guilt aversion to explain the behavior in strategic and non-strategic environments represented by playing the game sequentially and simultaneously respectively. We find that in the sequential treatment first movers invest significantly more than when the transfer decisions are conducted simultaneously. Moreover, in line with the theoretical prediction, 91% of subjects who invested the entire endowment received half of the surplus. On the other hand only 5% of subjects who invested anything less than the entire endowment received half. In the simultaneous treatment the proportions yield 11.1% and 32.1% respectively.

"7884","10092/161","Dixon, K.",,,,,,,"2012",,"This critical retrospective analysis is concerned with accountings as technologies of domination and of legitimation. Widespread studies of accounting usages and their contexts have illuminated these socio-political functions of accounting. Many of these studies are set in governmental contexts, where budgets, budgetary accounting and budgetary reporting have attained special significance in matters of imposing taxes, duties and similar non-reciprocal revenues and appropriating those revenues and expending them. The present study is set in this context but is distinguishable for being predicated on the inadequacies of history being relevant to understanding the present and contemplating the future. 
Accountings presently associated with two sovereign states are genealogized according to precursors, and to circumstances of persistency and of change. The two states comprise islands in the Pacific, with one described variously as a parliamentary democracy, constitutional (or limited) monarchy and commonwealth realm; and the other as a republic. Both their governmental structures and processes have been caught up in a recent worldwide neo-liberal trend away from bureau-ocracy towards manag-ocracy. Although both states are relatively new creations, the accountings genealogized in the study are discernible over at least a millennium – so making the study truly longitudinal. The direct ancestors of these accountings were used under several other -archies and -ocracies, in a distant geographical context comprised of islands in the Atlantic. Some were a technology of the colonialism that precipitated the two Pacific sovereign states under examination; and some have figured in the neo-imperialism that succeeded the colonialism. In one case, the neo-imperialism in question has been perpetrated by a settler élite in conjunction with external parties able to exercise significant power from a distance; and, in the other case, it has been perpetrated by similar external parties, assisted by a native élite. Elements of neo-imperialism continue today, some of it reinforced by accounting as a technology of global governance in which multilateral organisations and their prominent member governments are ascendant.",,,,"Dixon, K.

The factorial design used a combination of price endings and perceived quality of the retailer as treatments to test three behavioural outcome variables: price image, quality image of the products and quality image of the retailer. Respondents viewed a simulated experimental webpage and provided feedback via an on-line survey entered through a point and click interface. This study contributes to the increasingly growing body of research on price endings and quality perceptions. It provides insights on the way subjects respond to price as a way of expressing quality image perceptions. In contrast to prior literature, the results suggest that respondents have a more favourable attitude towards 99-price endings. However, for a higher quality retailer the price difference may not be as important.

joint programme of tribunal reform in New Zealand. The aim of the project was to
“recommend a structure for existing tribunals as well as a framework for the establishment of
tribunals in the future”. As I write this, the whisper from the Beehive suggests that the change
in government means that the tribunal reform project is to be put on ice. This is a disappointing
development but it should not surprise us. Although the tribunal system in New Zealand has
been ripe for reform almost since the first tribunal was established, successive attempts to
introduce coherence to the “system” have foundered in the difficult waters of the legislative
process. From their humble (and relatively late) beginnings in 1908, New Zealand's system of
tribunals now occupies a significant (perhaps even pre-eminent) position in New Zealand's
system of justice, particularly in the field of Administrative Law. Despite this, tribunals remain
a largely forgotten element of the wider legal system. Few student texts give much mentioned
of them and they remain very much an academic and political backwater. It should be no
surprise then that, given their astonishingly low profile in New Zealand, tribunals remain
largely un-loved, unnoticed and un-reformed institutions. This paper from which it comes aims

"7721","10092/161","Dixon, K.",,,,,,,"2012",,"This study is about how and why knowledge in the form of higher education learning has come to be accounted for using calculative practices. These practices are evident in public funding of higher education based on equivalent full-time students, student fee charging methods, credit accumulation and transfer systems, qualification frameworks, graduate profiles, levels of learning, learning outcomes, specifications of qualifications and courses/modules in credit points, assessment scores and grades, students’ academic records, diploma supplements, and things of that ilk. Using a genealogical approach, the antecedents of these various paraphernalia are analysed and exemplified, mainly in a former British settler-colony/dominion setting that is now a parliamentary democracy but in which managerialistic ideas are ascendant. There, the antecedents were influenced significantly by practices of the ancient universities in the colonising country. This was in an effort to attain equivalence in standards to these institutions, but at the same time being cognisant of the colony’s needs for but shortage of secondary school teachers; and later, the dominion’s needs for various professionals, including academics. Consequent to political, economic and social change in the post-WWII years, increased demands for educated labour, restructuring of higher education as a public policy system, broadening of the higher education curriculum, wider access to higher education, and mechanised forms of accounting also became influential. The third major twist was the imposition on and adoption by higher education institutions of various ideas associated with neo-liberalism and managerialism. These have included giving students the status of consumers, managing academics and academic innovation, standardising qualifications, and formalising quality assurance, including using audit and accreditation methods.

"4820","10092/161","Dixon, K.",,,,,,,"2010",,"Purpose – University academics are an important source of the discovery of knowledge
about accounting practice and accounting learning in New Zealand. This paper considers the
consequences for the Pacific society of New Zealand of beginning to measure this discovery
activity by subjecting the individual performances of these academics to scrutiny based on
the criteria of publishing items in periodicals that appear on lists compiled in Australia. The
lists in question are compiled by the Australian Business Deans Council (ABDC) and by the
Excellence in Research for Australia (ERA) Initiative.
Design/methodology/approach – A longitudinal approach is taken, including by reviewing
the literature on developments in New Zealand universities and higher education in New
Zealand for over a century; and by analysing the publication over more than two decades of
knowledge about accounting practice and accounting learning in New Zealand in periodicals
appearing on the ABDC and ERA lists. Each journal and magazine associated with
accounting was identified, including some journals not classified on the lists as accounting
and some journals not on either list. Various data were derived on each periodical, including
about editors and editorial boards, and about articles that contained the words “New
Zealand”. The articles were downloaded and perused to ascertain why these words appeared.
Articles that are based on empirical data from New Zealand were classified by topic areas.
Findings – Of the three activities associated with accounting in New Zealand universities
(i.e. professional accounting education and assessment, undergraduate and postgraduate
accounting learning and teaching, accounting research), research has been the last to develop.
Now, it is often given highest priority, at least in the rhetoric used by some of the people in
managerial and collegial positions who set priorities inside universities, if not in terms of
internal university departmental resourcing or in terms of expressions of priorities by society,
the New Zealand Government, the accounting profession and accounting students. This high
priority has led to formal academic performance management systems, and related incentives
and penalties, all increasingly focused on individual accounting academics and the rate at
which they are publishing in accounting periodicals, the vast majority of which are on the
ABDC and ERA lists. However, analysis of periodicals on these lists and other journals
identified but not on either list indicates that there are few journal publication outlets directly
associated with New Zealand for knowledge discovered about accounting practice and
accounting learning in New Zealand. Indeed, despite their Australian origin, or perhaps
because of it, most of the journals are edited in places on the rim of the North Atlantic, and of
3
the countless languages used in the modern Pacific, only English-language journals appear
(except for Canada-based journals, which are obliged to provide English and French
translations). The analysis also indicates that New Zealand accounting academics have and
continue to publish their work in foreign-based journals, more in Australia and the United
Kingdom than in the United States of America and Canada. It can be inferred from some
article titles and other ad hoc evidence that the academics in question have had to modify the
way the knowledge is reported to suit the foreign editors and, presumably, readers, which is
probably at odds with how a New Zealand audience would prefer the knowledge to be
reported. The analysis also indicates that to publish about New Zealand in foreign journals
there is some advantage in studying areas in which New Zealand is seen as a “world leader”
in the topic (e.g. structural adjustment, New Public Management, environmental accounting)
but not in areas about which the outside world is oblivious (e.g. New Zealand’s multicultural
array of people and organisations, including the Maori people).",,,,"Dixon, K.

Only recently, the influence of an individual group member on other customers’ service perception has found its way into service management literature. A growing body of research now deals with customer – to – customer interaction (CCI) and focuses on the impact individual customers have on services that are delivered to other individual customers. Very little is known about the different roles within these groups in a service experience. In recent management literature, leadership has been examined in classical employee – manager relationships. In services marketing publications there appears to be a lack of research on the influence of different customer roles on a service encounter.
In this paper we set out to examine the role an informal leader takes in customer groups. Specifically, our purpose is to explore how leadership of the informal leader influences 1) satisfaction with him and with the service and 2) how customer – to – customer interaction mediates this relationships. The hypothesized relationships between satisfaction with the service, satisfaction with the informal leader, leadership behaviour, and CCI are tested in a structural equation model. Drawing on a sample of 225 customers who have experienced a group service we demonstrate that leadership behaviour of an informal leader has a negative and satisfaction with the informal leader has a positive effect on satisfaction with the service. Additionally, we confirm that this leadership behaviour has a positive effect on customer – to – customer interaction and we examine the mediating role of CCI within the relationship between leadership behaviour and satisfaction.

with neo-liberal ideas of what is good for the private individual, a concept not much
developed in Kiribati. Accounting also figured in implementing each policy phase, noticeably
by helping constitute and reinforce hegemony of I-Matang over I-Kiribati, and is now
sustaining organisations that, although they have come to be staffed by I-Kiribati, are of a
colonial nature and seem to be regarded by most I-Kiribati as still “belonging” to I-Matang.

These times have also been ones over which universities, ancient and modern, have been influenced by such policy movements as “‘New’ Higher Education”, “‘New’ Public Management” and “Structural Adjustment”. This study considers the inter-relatedness of these two series of changes, addressing the questions of how curricular accounting has come to reflect these policy movements; and how curricular accounting has influenced or helped constitute them.
Design/Methodology/Approach – The subject is addressed in the context of accounting in organisations and society. In a broader, longitudinal study of the phenomenon of curricular accounting, the former University of New Zealand and its affiliate in Christchurch, New Zealand, and the successor of that affiliate, Te Whare Wananga o Waitaha /the University of Canterbury, were used for archival study and participant-observation. The credit system used at the University of Canterbury in 2010 was analysed retrospectively and genealogically, through antecedent arrangements back to the founding of Canterbury College in1873. Ideas were used of representational schemes of and negotiated orders among parties associated with the case institution, and of changes in these being path-dependent. In the present paper, particular attention is paid to how and why, in the years since about 1984, curricular accounting evolved alongside revolutionary changes to New Zealand public services and associated changes to New Zealand’s universities and its higher education system. 
Findings – The retrospective analysis illuminates how and why changes to public services and universities re-shaped and re-formed curricular accounting, and how and why curricular accounting came to enable and further fuel the university and higher education policy system changes. Of particular significance are how, within institutions, curricular accounting has come to figure in steering and controlling academics at a distance; and how, within the public policy area of higher education, similar applies to university institutions and other levels of the policy system through to the core of the Government of New Zealand.
Research limitations/ implications – Curricular accounting has multifarious consequences for students, academics, alumni, universities and similar institutions, higher education, governments and others. The findings are derived from an accounting perspective and there is scope for adding other perspectives. There is much scope for further research, including into similarities and differences in higher education policy systems in other jurisdictions.
Practical Implications – The paper may improve understanding of curricular accounting, including among those practicing it and controlled by it; and it raises issues that are likely to condition further developments.
Originality Value – Curricular accounting is now in the accounting literature.",,,,"Keith Dixon (2010) Reflection and constitution of “new” public service and “new” university education in and through curricular accounting.

The most detailed substantive provisions, whether they be income tax, GST,  or other regimes, are of little use unless the authorities can obtain the information needed to establish (or at least approximate) a taxpayer’s liability.
At the same time, the increased threat to confidentiality posed by to new technologies utilised by revenue authorities means it is even more important to ensure that such access powers provide adequate safeguards for taxpayers.
The proximity of Australia and New Zealand, both geographically and otherwise, make it informative to compare the way they have approached a common issue – obtaining crucial information from sometimes reluctant taxpayers. 
The powers available to Australian and New Zealand tax officers to seek out and directly access information share a number of similarities – in part because New Zealand incorporated some features of the former Australian access power (s 263 Income Tax Assessment Act 1936) into its own access provision in s 16 of the Tax Administration Act 1994.  However, there are also some interesting and significant differences.

In the first instance, it is an event study which sets out to determine whether or not a dividend signal can be detected, given that earnings and dividends are announced jointly by publicly listed New Zealand companies.  The second purpose is much more important.  In place of the usual simple OLS procedure known as the Market Model to estimate risk-adusted expected returns (and from these, abnormal returns), this paper contributes to event study literature by employing a friction model in which the values of relevant parameters are determined by a maximum likelihood estimation procedure.  This friction modelling approach is more robust than the Market Model when an event study is run on company returns data in the context of a thinly-traded market as it is not immediately reliant on the assumptions underlying the employability of OLS regression.  In addition, given that traditionally a piggy-back procedure involving restricted least squares regresssion has been used by past researchers to sort out the confounding effects of simultaneous dividends and earnings disclosures, this paper further contributes to event study literature and dividend signalling literature by positing several friction models which effectively achieves this same disentanglement.

casting a competent vote requires some basic knowledge of the incumbent’s identity, the

that, if ignorance is unbiased, overall results will be determined by informed voters as the
ignorant cancel each other out. Lupia and McCubbins (1998) provides a mechanism
whereby voters with little information can take cues from more informed colleagues in
order to vote as if they had the requisite information. Using data from a uniquely useful
dataset, the 2005 New Zealand Election Survey, I show that both mechanisms fail.
Political ignorance is not unbiased: rather, it strongly predicts policy and political party
preferences after correcting for the demographic correlates of ignorance. Moreover,

Some of these options involve engineering the earth to reduce the impact or affect of climate change; in particular, marine geo-engineering is seeking to explore ocean-based climate change mitigation measures. One of these options – the sub-seabed sequestration of carbon dioxide – has recently (and controversially) been addressed by the 1996 London Protocol to the 1972 London (Dumping) Convention. The parties to the 1996 Protocol have also asserted that this instrument has jurisdiction over ocean fertilization activities and are currently developing guidelines designed to permit fertilization for the purpose of science only. Neither sequestration nor fertilization fits entirely comfortably within the dumping regime, and it is clear that other geo-engineering schemes (such as those involving the deposit of devices into the ocean and the placement of dams across straits) will fall outside of the regulatory remit of these instruments.
This paper will explore the extent to which the law of the sea is capable of responding to the marine geo-engineering challenge, and whether the current regulatory tools provide the appropriate regulatory framework for proactive management of marine geo-engineering. This paper will conclude with an outline of a proposal for the development of a regime to regulate emerging climate change mitigation technologies. Whilst policy questions and general principles relating to geo-engineering are arguably best addressed within the regime established by the 1992 United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, detailed regulation and management of geo-engineering technologies is better suited to institutions and regimes that have specialist expertise in the area of the technology in question.

He was not successful in obtaining an injunction to prevent publication,[1] but was awarded the highest damages to date for a privacy claim in Britain - ƒ60,000.[2]
In New Zealand the tort of privacy is in an early stage of development which is influenced by what is happening in the UK and elsewhere, and the questions currently being raised about it reveal much about how we think and feel about privacy generally and its place in the liberal democracy we have in this country. The tort is being exhaustively investigated by the New Zealand Law Commission, which has just issued a significant Issues Paper on privacy generally[3]. Following his success, Mr Mosley is currently suing 17 individuals in Germany, France and Italy in defamation. He is also considering suing the NoW in defamation for the Nazi references in its coverage, which were found in the privacy case to be untrue, but wants to await the outcome of the European actions so that he is not seen as a ‘bully’. Mr Mosley is, however, actively campaigning for a privacy law in the United Kingdom which would require pre-notification by newspapers to individuals if it is intended to publish details of their private lives.
In this paper, I investigate the Mosley case to determine its impact on New Zealand law, if any. In particular, I examine the sort of facts which give rise to an expectation of privacy, the relevance of plaintiff culpability, the test of high offensiveness of publication, the remedies which might be sought, and the possibility that the privacy tort could metamorphosise into a general loss of dignity claim which embraces the claims we currently know as defamation and breach of privacy.

On the other hand, fragmentation of international law – as characterised by “the emergence of specialized and (relatively) autonomous rules or rule complexes, legal institutions and spheres of legal practice”1 – emphasises the isolation and disconnect between regimes and institutions.

Design/methodology/approach – We adopt an eclectic approach; use historical sources and participant-observation data; compose an analytical description of consequences of accounting for the last several generations of Kain Nikunau; and discuss the findings in order to enhance the present literature about consequences of accounting.
Findings – Human application of I-Matang accounting ideas and practices, figuring even mundanely and unobtrusively in various activities and situations (e.g. trade, mining and wage employment, Christian missions and churches, formal education, medical care and other public services, development planning and bi-lateral aid, and colonial and island government), have caused or formed conditions of possibility for wide-ranging and far-reaching changes on Nikunau and to Kain Nikunau. These changes are consequences of accounting and may be classified as biological, cultural, demographic, distributional, environmental, geographic, macro- and micro-economic, organisational, political, religious, social and societal.

"3892","10092/161","Wright, S.",,,,,,,"2009",,"The public sector in New Zealand has experienced, and continues to experience a myriad of internal and external pressures affecting their ability to retain skilled staff. Increasing legislative changes, closer monitoring of organization performance, and the inability to match commercial remuneration combined with the increasing demand for high-skilled labor has created a challenging employment environment for public sector employers. A major component of this problem is not only to attract and select the people with the necessary skills to meet performance expectations, but to retain
skilled and professional staff who are already in the organization. The research summarized here stems from a longitudinal action-research study with a
Government organization in New Zealand. Over the past five years, the organization has experienced an average turnover rate of 29.4% (excluding redundancies), which is higher than the current public sector standard of 14%. Turnover statistics indicate the
average employee stays with the organization for 2 years and 8 months. The purpose of the project was therefore to identify, measure, and monitor those factors which had the greatest impact on employee retention in an increasingly tight labor market for
highly skilled and professional employees. Although there has been substantial progress in identifying individual variables that impact on turnover (e.g. Maertz & Campion, 1998), there has been no overarching framework to help mesh the
motivations for staying with an organization. The purpose of this research was therefore to simultaneously investigate both turnover and retention factors. A parallel interest in the retention study was whether dissatisfaction with interpersonal relations in the workplace (namely, loneliness) resulted in the employee
exiting the organization. Dissatisfied employees tend to withdraw from their
organizations, either through psychological disconnection or actual job departure
(Hanisch, 1995). Arguably, if an employee feels dissatisfied at work due to emotional
or social detachment, it follows that they are likely to psychologically withdraw from
that environment. This is particularly notable as both loneliness and organizational
commitment appear to have an affective component as their underlying basis. Additionally, Lee, Mitchell and Wise (1996) found an association between interpersonal relationships at work and turnover intentions. It was therefore predicted that loneliness at work would have a negative effect on employee attitudes, instigating a desire to withdraw from the organization.",,,,"Wright, S.

It is little wonder then that kinship is the foundation of many atoll societies, traditional and even modern. This study is a retrospective analysis of a Pacific people living in several countries but held together as a diaspora through notions of kinship. The people concerned have indigenous, ancestral, cultural, social and continuing residential connections with Nikunau Atoll (coordinates 1.3475°S 176.4512°E). The analysis incorporates the present diasporic circumstances of this people, including how these circumstances arose historically. The core idea of the paper is that such an analysis provides a basis for surfacing and explaining the circumstances of the people in question, and so a basis for improving their circumstances from a critical, better-informed standpoint. The method of conducting the analysis relies heavily on the partisan stance of me, the author, whose kinship ties with I-Nikunau (= people who identify with Nikunau) are affinal. I identify, grapple with, articulate and interpret situations and events, including those I observed or experienced, or was told about, and those at least referred to or, in many cases, delved into by other researchers. The circumstances are analysed under 14 themes, including geographical, demographical, economic, environmental, cultural and societal circumstances. As well as appealing to I-Nikunau, the analysis may be relevant to the growing number of studies about Nikunau and Kiribati, most of them concerned with prospects of climate change making Nikunau, Tarawa and other atolls where I-Nikunau reside uninhabitable. That the authors of many of these studies published recently make so many references to the matters covered in this analysis would seem to indicate how relevant and important the matters in question are to the future of I-Nikunau and I-Kiribati. Furthermore, this relevance and importance may apply to the future of other peoples still inhabiting the world’s atolls and facing whatever challenges this future may bring, climate-related and otherwise.",,,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/14933",,,"en",,,"LMU Munich, Department for Social and Cultural Anthropology",,,,,,,,,,,"Field of Research::16 - Studies in Human Society::1699 - Other Studies in Human Society::169905 - Studies of Pacific Peoples' Societies||Field of Research::20 - Language, Communication and Culture::2002 - Cultural Studies::200210 - Pacific Cultural Studies||Field of Research::16 - Studies in Human Society::1608 - Sociology::160802 - Environmental Sociology||Field of Research::16 - Studies in Human Society::1606 - Political Science::160606 - Government and Politics of Asia and the Pacific||Field of Research::16 - Studies in Human Society::1604 - Human Geography::160403 - Social and Cultural Geography||Field of Research::20 - Language, Communication and Culture::2002 - Cultural Studies::200211 - Postcolonial Studies",,,"History matters!||Nikunau Atoll||I-Nikunau (= people who identify with Nikunau)||Gilbert Islands||Kiribati||Diaspora||Circular labour migration||Colonialism||Imperialism||Climate change",,,,"Circumstances of a Pacific atoll people in diaspora: a retrospective analysis of I-Nikunau",,,"Conference Contributions - Other",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study examines the institutional logic embedded with New Zealand’s discourse on executive remuneration, and how it influences the decision-making of remuneration committees.  
Design/methodology/approach: Data are collected from 33 semi-structured interviews with 5 executives, 16 non-executive directors, 7 consultants, and 5 representatives of issuers (who produce codes of best practice).  The interviews focused on executive remuneration in New Zealand publicly listed companies.  
Findings: Non-executive directors draw on a multitude of rationales to justify or legitimise their decisions regarding executive remuneration.  The rationales include: agency, consultant, fairness, human resources, market, motivation, pay-for-performance, and responsibility.  However, the market rationale dominated the discourse on executive remuneration.  The majority of non-executive directors, executives, and consultants interviewed argued that one executive’s remuneration should be comparable to another executive’s remuneration.  
Research limitations/implications: Both the agency and corporate logics have been institutionalised in New Zealand.  However, the dominant remuneration rationales fit with the corporate logic, rather than the agency logic.
Practical implications: As the remuneration rationales are taken-for-granted they offer non-executive directors considerable flexibility in deciding how and how much to remunerate executives. Shareholders and regulators need to be aware of this flexibility.
Originality/value: This study develops and tests a theoretical framework for understanding how institutional logics can influence organisational decision-making.

Design/methodology/approach: The paper uses a pragmatic approach in reconciling agency and stewardship theory.

Findings: As well as a framework for implementing strategy, Robert Simons’ levers of control can be used to regulate the behaviour of the CEO.  Beliefs and interactive control systems encourage pro-organisational behaviour, whereas boundary and diagnostic control systems constrain self-interested (or opportunistic) behaviour.  

Originality/value: Assuming people are opportunistic leads to accounting and control systems which encourage opportunistic behaviour and discourage pro-organisational behaviour.  Assuming people are pro-organisational leads to accounting and control systems which an opportunistic CEO can exploit.

Findings: While stakeholders and management work towards mutually agreed upon objectives, at times they also work against each other and pursue their own self-interests.  The organisation has, however, been able to survive due to the introduction of accountability mechanisms.

This is because interim earnings figures may thought to be less trustworthy than annual ones. Given that firms listed on the New Zealand stock Exchange are required to furnish half‐yearly financial reports, and that these reports disclose both EPS and dividend information, the simultaneity and semi‐annual frequency of New Zealand company EPS and DPS information provide a natural test of differences between investor reactions to within‐year and end‐of‐year announcement data with respect to Miller and Rock’s contention.",,,,"Anderson, W.W.

expectations based on documentary analysis that the two jurisdictions approaches
would differ, but revealed significant differences in the level of involvement of tax
practitioners in preparing for CbCR, and between the Big 4 and mid-tier CA firms.

This paper explores the consequences for the Pacific society of New Zealand of performance of these discovery and dissemination activities being measured at the individual level using criteria directly linked to lists of periodicals compiled in Australia and that are decidedly Atlantocentric. 
Design/methodology/approach – A longitudinal approach is taken to how knowledge about accounting practice and accounting learning in New Zealand has been disseminated, and whether trends in this dissemination are suited to New Zealand audiences, including New Zealand students, New Zealand accountants, New Zealand policymakers, Aotearoa New Zealand’s indigenous people and its diverse recent-settler populations, and Pacific New Zealand Society. Over 100 accounting journals, magazines and similar periodicals are analysed, over the past quarter century and more, for articles based on empirical data from New Zealand. The findings relate to not only the topics of articles and which journals they have been published in, and what trends are arising. They also are interpreted in the broader context of university development and activities, and tertiary education policy and funding.
Findings –Of the three activities associated with accounting in New Zealand universities, research has been the last to develop, starting with occasional articles from a small band of professors in the Chartered Accountants’ Journal (CAJ). Now, it is often accorded the highest priority, as reflected in formal individual academic performance management systems, and related incentives and penalties (exemplified by Performance Based Research Fund 2012). 
Publication patterns are changing. The CAJ has been deserted in favour of academic journals, virtually all published outside New Zealand. Academics have modified the way they report to suit the foreign editors and readerships. To publish about New Zealand in these journals, there is some advantage in studying areas in which New Zealand is seen as a “world leader” (e.g., Structural Adjustment, New Public Management, environmental accounting) but not in areas about which the outside world is oblivious (e.g., New Zealand’s multicultural array of people and organisations, including the Maori people) or in areas in which New Zealand lacks differences of “world” interest (e.g., financial collapses and director impropriety, what can be learnt by utilising stock exchange data). 
There do seem to be strong incentives for New Zealand-based academics to set their research in jurisdictions of more interest to journal publishers, if they want to score highly in individual performance management systems. How fit does that then make them to teach students about practices, concepts and issues in New Zealand? 
Research limitations/implications – The research is still in progress. 
Originality/value – Most studies of this ilk attempt to rank journals or are about researcher productivity and author placement.

Many of these studies are set in governmental contexts, where budgets, budgetary accounting and budgetary reporting have attained special significance in matters of imposing and appropriating taxes. The present study is set in this context but is distinguishable in several respects. The author genealogizes the accounting presently associated with a sovereign state described variously as a parliamentary democracy, constitutional (or limited) monarchy and commonwealth realm; and which has led a recent worldwide neo-liberal trend away from bureaucracy towards managocracy. Furthermore, the direct ancestors of this accounting are discernible over at least one millennium – so making the study truly longitudinal – and were used under several other -archies and -[o]cracies. Indeed, mostly, these ancestors were used in a distant geographical context, and some were a technology of the colonialism that precipitated the present sovereign state. That colonialism gave way to neo-imperialism, perpetrated by a settler élite in conjunction with external parties able to exercise significant power from a distance, assisted by accounting. There are still elements of neo-imperialism today, some of it reinforced by accounting as a technology of globalisation.

"9507","10092/161","Crombie, N.A.",,,,,,,"2013",,"Purpose: Corporate Logic and Investor Logic are the two dominant institutional logics of corporate governance in Anglo-Saxon countries (Lok, 2010; Zajac and Westphal, 2004). Corporate Logic portrays executives as trustworthy professionals that will voluntarily act in the best interests of shareholders. On the other hand, Investor Logic portrays executives as self-interested agents, who are capable of maximising shareholder value, but only if incentives schemes are used to align their interests with those of shareholders. Corporate Logic and Investor Logic have opposing implications for executive remuneration. However, prior research has only studied a few aspects of executive remuneration (Zajac and Westphal, 2004). This research examines executive remuneration, in a holistic manner, in order to determine the extent to which Corporate Logic and Investor Logic are embedded in corporate governance codes and corporate annual reports.
Approach: Drawing on interpretive structuralism (Phillips and Hardy, 2002), a discourse analysis is used to deconstruct and elucidate the discourse on executive remuneration that is embedded in codes and corporate annual reports. The sample includes 55 codes and 75 annual reports produced between 1991 and 2010 in the UK, Australia (AU) and New Zealand (NZ). Multiple features of the texts are examined to ascertain how Corporate Logic and Investor Logic are embedded in the discourse. These features included 6 remuneration principles and 8 (broad) remuneration practices.
Findings: Code issuers and companies draw on multiple remuneration principles to justify their remuneration practices, and these principles and practices are consistent with both Corporate Logic and Investor Logic. Consistent with Corporate Logic, the human resources and market principles are tied to base salaries and recruitment and retention schemes. Consistent with Investor Logic, the agency, motivation and pay-for-performance principles are tied to short- and long-term incentive schemes. As a set, these principles and practices represent what is deemed legitimate and rational, despite Corporate Logic and Investor Logic being theoretically incompatible. By drawing on both Logics, code issuers and companies are afforded much flexibility; that is, the prevailing institutional logics enable, rather than constrain, their discourse.
Theoretical implications: Unlike prior research, this research recognises that the discourse on executive remuneration is highly nuanced and cannot be easily understood through a reductionist content analysis. While Zajac and Westphal (2004) evidenced a transition from Corporate Logic to Investor Logic, this research’s discourse analysis shows that both Logics coexist, as distinct from compete, in the discourse on executive remuneration.
Practical implications: As both Logics coexist in the discourse, producers (e.g. code issuers and companies) and consumers (e.g. investors) of the discourse have to cope with much ambiguity and tension inherent in the remuneration principles and practices that constitute the standard remuneration package for executives. For companies, this means their executive remuneration practices cannot be easily challenged and their legitimacy can be maintained through the symbolic use of remuneration principles and practices. To enhance accountability, code issuers, investors and others should exert pressure on companies to simplify their executive remuneration practices and disclosure.",,,,"Crombie, N.A.

The empirical materials include secondary sources covering more than two centuries from various disciplines, and participant-observations during a quarter of a century. They are composed into an analytical description of occurrences that paralleled accounting usages for the last several generations of Kain Nikunau. These usages have been local and distant. They relate to trade, mining and wage employment, religion-making, government, formal education, medical care and other services, development projects and aid. The analytical description is interpreted partially in terms of consequences for Kain Nikunau of accounting usages.

Implementing lean is always a challenging project, because of the need to customise the implementation. There is also the issue of organisational culture and change management resistance. A unique aspect of this project was the embedment of the project engineer in the plant. This developed trust and facilitated subsequent implementation. Changes were then introduced to the plant following the 5S methodology, followed by Value Stream Mapping.  The project resulted in a 7% cost saving on labour. Further benefits from the project were that disruption to the daily production activities were kept to a minimum, a reduction of consumables, and elimination of unnecessary burdening of employees.

"11497","10092/161","Sawyer, A.J.",,,,,,,"2014",,"Value Added Taxes (VATs or Goods and Services Taxes - GSTs) are being increasingly adopted globally, with VAT/GST revenues similarly increasing through higher contributions from indirect taxation to total tax revenues. Unsurprisingly, increased focus is being placed on the design of such taxes, encompassing policy choices and legislative drafting styles.  New Zealand’s (NZ’s) GST, introduced in 1986, is held up as the ‘model’ VAT in a post-European VAT environment, especially when measured against the key tax principles of efficiency and simplicity. Importantly, the trade-off has been less equity within the tax itself, which necessitates forms of compensation elsewhere in the tax system. The vast majority of GSTs developed since 1986 have used the NZ GST model as a starting point, although no subsequent GST/VAT has been as ‘pure’ as the NZ model. A number of factors have been influential in resulting VAT/GSTs. This includes: the actual design, prevailing tax policy process; general economic environment; and jurisdictional political philosophies (at the time the VAT/GST is promulgated and implemented). Of particular importance in NZ is the Generic Tax Policy Process (GTPP) which encourages both early and widespread consultation over tax policy design and draft legislation.  
This paper seeks to provide an overview of NZ’s GST (including the core concepts within the GTPP) as a case study for evaluation as a possible ‘initial model’ for adaptation in China as it seeks to reform its VAT. Through building on prior work reviewing the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region’s (the HKSAR’s) GST experience and policy development framework, this paper offers insights into why the author believes the NZ GST experience should be of both interest and relevance to the People’s Republic of China (the PRC). This is premised on the basis that NZ’s GST has been endorsed in subsequent tax system reviews, and survived notwithstanding major changes in the NZ political environment and prevailing economic conditions.",,,,"Sawyer, A.J.

"11961","10092/161","Cheer, U.",,,,,,,"2013",,"New Zealanders are enthusiastic adopters of new technology and our use of the internet has been described as at near saturation point.  In a 2013 survey, 81% of respondents rated the internet  as important or very important. Importance ratings of offline media were very different - the proportion who rated offline (or mainstream) media as important were: television (47%), radio (37%) and newspapers (37%). Although watching television is an important leisure activity for people of all ages, 80% of respondents aged 16–29 said the internet is important or very important for entertainment purposes.

In this technological landscape, New Zealand, like other legal systems, is facing challenges arising from harms caused by the publication of online speech. Existing forms of speech regulation are being tested and some adaption has occurred. In addition, the government recently commissioned an investigation into whether gaps exist in the law but ultimately rejected suggestions for a new grand regulator.  

This paper examines the contextual background of current media regulation in New Zealand and the challenges presented by the proliferation of online speech.  It considers proposals from the New Zealand Law Commission for a new grand-regulator covering mainstream and new media, and the rejection by the Government of those proposals.  The paper then examines the current patchwork of regulation applying to online speech and the introduction by the Government of a Harmful Digital Communications Bill.  Although there are many positive elements to this current patchwork of regulation, it is concluded that overall the system of regulation is too complex, inaccessible and lacks cohesion.  The lesson from the New Zealand experience suggests a grand regulator dealing with both offline and online speech is the most desirable solution.",,,,"Cheer, U.

"12048","10092/161","Maples, A.J.||Sawyer, A.J.",,,,,,,"2014",,"The Canterbury earthquakes of 2010 and 2011 have shone the spotlight on a number of tax issues. These issues, and in particular lessons learned from them, will be relevant for revenue authorities, policymakers and taxpayers alike in the broader context of natural disasters. Issues considered by this paper include the tax treatment of insurance monies.  For example, building owners will receive pay-outs for destroyed assets and buildings which have been depreciated. Where the insurance payment is more than the adjusted tax value, there will be a taxable ""gain on sale"" (or depreciation recovery income). If the building owner uses those insurance proceeds to purchase a replacement asset, legislative amendments specifically enacted following the earthquakes provide that rollover relief of the depreciation recovery income is available.  

The tax treatment of expenditure to seismically strengthen a building is another significant issue faced by building owners. Case law has determined that this expenditure will usually be capital expenditure. In the past such costs could be capitalised to the building and depreciated accordingly. However, since the 2011-2012 income year owners have been prohibited from claiming depreciation on buildings and therefore currently no deduction is available for such strengthening expenditure (whether immediate or deferred). This has significant potential implications for landlords throughout New Zealand facing significant seismic retrofit costs.  Incentives, or some form of financial support, whether delivered through the tax system or some other mechanism may be required. 

International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) require insurance proceeds, including reimbursement for expenditure of a capital nature, be reported as income while expenditure itself is not recorded as a current period expense. This has the effect of overstating current income and creating a larger variation between reported income for accounting and taxation purposes. Businesses have obligations to maintain certain business records for tax purposes.  Reconstructing records destroyed by a natural disaster depends on how the information was originally stored. The earthquakes have demonstrated the benefits of ‘off-site’ (outside Canterbury) storage, in particular electronic storage. This paper considers these issues and the Inland Revenue Department (Inland Revenue) Standard Practice Statement which deals with inter alia retention of business records in electronic format and offshore record storage. Employer provided accommodation is treated as income to the benefitting employee. A recent amendment to the Income Tax Act 2007 retrospectively provides that certain employer provided accommodation is exempt from tax. The time aspect of these rules is extended where the employee is involved in the Canterbury rebuild and comes from outside the region.",,,,"Maples, A.J., Sawyer, A.J.

Beginning with a review of the academic use of image, the epistemological roots for pictorial representation are then uncovered: to help provide a firmer theoretical foundation for using image in management. Next, the reader is shown how pictorial representation fits into an holistic analytical framework. Subsequently, the methodology is applied in a 'live' situation, with glimpses provided of the strategic use of pictorial representation in British and Canadian business schools. Data from the project are presented to illustrate how image can be applied to practical strategy formulation and implementation. Overall, it is felt that images can be valuable as vehicles for exploring people's organisational constructs.

Surprisingly, although very ready to examine the activities of other organisations, it is only very recently that the academic world has attempted to turn the analytical magnifying glass back on itself. Much of this impetus comes from external pressures, rather than from a visionary flash of introspective fervour. British academics are currently under the microscope of the Academic Audit Unit, set up by the Committee of Vice-Chancellors and Principals to investigate and make recommendations concerning the maintenance and improvement of teaching quality in universities. The Canadian Government are also in the process of undertaking a similar review of higher education in Canada. The timeliness of this study and its implications for education policy and strategic management in both countries should be readily apparent.
Using a methodology integrating conceptual developments in strategy implementation, organisational behaviour, social psychology and political sociology; innovative techniques have been applied combining quantitative methods, projective exercises, ethnography and discourse analysis in a case study situation.
Participant observation, secondary data analysis, face-to-face interviews and feedback Delphi groups provide a triangulated exploration of the issues and processes facing the quality-seeking academic institution. Specific instruments include a Rokeach-type technique especially designed for investigating academics' value systems; the applied cluster analysis of

demographic data, attitudes and values for identifying subcultures within the organisation; and pictorial representation used to enrich verbal data. A dynamic approach is used to enhance understanding of organisational change processes in a
university environment.
Ultimately, as well as providing a holistic diagnostic tool of intra-organisational processes, the methodology aims to assist the formulation and introduction of Total Teaching Quality (TTQ) implementation strategies in higher education. Even before the conclusion of this comparative study, lessons drawn concerning the successful implementation of a quality strategy in an unique, complex and often frustrating culture are inescapable. At the very least, if we as academics are to cast our own eyes over the workings of other organisations, we must first try to understand our own.",,,,"Stiles, David R.

The Court of Justice has established in 1982 that sex-workers can be workers (Case 115 and 116/81 Adoui and Cournaille) for the purpose of free movement. Thus, where sex-work is decriminalised or regulated, sex-work can be considered to be a normal economic activity. 
However, in some circumstances sex-work cannot be considered “normal” work. For instance conditions for receiving welfare benefits might include applying for available jobs but could job-seekers be required to apply for an available sex-work position? Are there situations where standard employment law should not/cannot apply to sex-work (or indeed should but does not)? Are there circumstances where existing employment law needs to be adapted to serve the specific circumstances of sex-workers? For instance, some health and safety regulations might need to be adapted to reflect the health needs of these workers or the risk for violence. 
This paper investigates employment law in various jurisdictions including the Netherlands, Sweden and New Zealand, to map out standards and conditions of employment that can be transferred from “normal” work to sex-work and areas where sex-workers need different terms and conditions of employment or special protective measures.",,,,"Masselot, A.

Prior studies have tended to examine impression management strategies independently. Further, studies typically only consider a single disclosure type. This suggests that research has overlooked the fact that managers are likely to consider a range of alternative disclosures and impression management approaches in developing their disclosure strategies. By considering a range of both disclosure types and impression management strategies, this study attempts to uncover important interrelationships between these factors, thereby enriching our understanding of corporate disclosure strategies. A sample of 824 disclosures made by listed companies in Australia and New Zealand is examined. The disclosures include key narratives typically contained in annual reports including the chairman’s letter, management’s discussion and analysis, the notes to the accounts, and any embedded Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) report. Additionally, narratives contained in separately issued CSR reports were studied. The study finds weak evidence of readability manipulation obfuscating the disclosures of poorer performing companies. However, the themes within the disclosures of poorer performing companies tended to closely mirror those of more well performing companies – an observation consistent with the Pollyanna principle. The study also finds that disclosures with a positive tone are more readable than those with a negative tone, a result consistent with the obfuscation hypothesis. CSR reports are found to be more readable than annual reports in general and have significantly different thematic characteristics. Interestingly, CSR disclosures in annual reports differed considerably in terms of their readability from their counterparts in dedicated CSR reports.",,,,"Richard, G., Fisher, R., van Staden, C.

In addition it provides analysis of the content and structure of the corporate integrated reports published on the IIRC Emerging Examples Database over the period prior and subsequent to the publication of the final version of the IR Framework in December 2013. The purpose of this research is to provide insights into the processes and influences on the development of IR, a new reporting mode which is claimed as representing a fundamental shift away from the traditional focus of financial reporting, and to assess the potential that dominant industry players have ‘captured’ integrated reporting. 
Design/methodology/approach – Integrated reports published on the IIRC database in the years 2013 to 2015 were analysed for company information, report information and report content, and evaluated as to the extent that these adhere to the integrated reporting (IR) guiding principles and content elements. In addition, the submissions to the April 2013 Consultation Draft of the Framework were analyzed on variables of industry type and content. The paper is informed by a Capture Theory approach in its evaluation of the extent of industry influence over the development of IR. 
Findings – Our study found that the financial services industry was the largest industry group that provided submissions to the (IIRC) 2013 Consultation Draft of the International IR Framework. The analysis also revealed that the incidence of IR is dominated by the financial services industry. In addition it found that reporting companies failed to achieve all 5 IR guiding principles, and that there was a low level of responsiveness to stakeholder inclusiveness. This suggests that the reports (and indeed business operations) are still focused only on the shareholder group’s needs rather than those of stakeholders more generally. 
Originality/value - This study is important as it provides insights into the processes of the development of new accounting regulation, and suggests the extent to which IR has been subject to the influence of particular industry groups’ interests rather than being neutral in its outcome.",,,,"Wild, S., van Staden, C.

In particular, we will answer two questions; what change is, and why individuals perceive change differently. These are some key issues raised by past researchers of accounting change that require further examination and fuller explanation.

Design/methodology/approach – This study uses the concept of ""aniccata"" (often translated as ""impermanence"") from Buddhist philosophy, which assumes that everything that one perceives as existing is a construction of the observer, owing to limitations in perceiving the continual process of emergence and decline of all things. Empirical materials were gathered on change in a telecommunications organisation in Sri Lanka using interviews and document reviews to construct our knowledge about Sri Lanka Telecom, its context and accounting practices.

Findings – Using the concept of impermanence, we demonstrate that what individuals observe as change in accounting practices is the difference in the properties of the static entities constructed by individuals due to delays in observing or inability to observe all instantaneous changes of a given aspect. As individuals' constructions are subject to their personal knowledge, interests, and experiences, properties of these constructions differ from one observer to another. As individuals observe changes relative to the properties of their own constructions, they perceive change in accounting practices differently and act accordingly.

Originality/value – This study introduces a different perspective to extant literature in order to explain change in organisations and accounting practices. It answers questions that remained open in relation to the nature of change in accounting practices.","Same paper also presented at 10th Conference of the European Network for Research in Organisational & Accounting Change (ENROAC), <span style=""text-align: center; font-size: 10pt;"">Galway,Ireland, 3-4June 2015</span>",,,"Gunatilake, G., Lord, B.R., Dixon, K.

"13823","10092/323","Chen, N.||Šegota, T.",,,,,,,"2015",,"Purpose – This paper aims to propose a new line of research that explores the relationship
between residents and destination brand building behaviours through the concept of place
attachment.
Design and methodology – We conducted a literature review on place attachment and brand
building behaviour, and focused more specifically on place identity as an accumulation based
dimension of place attachment and word-of-mouth as a behavioural outcome.
Approach – With the emergence of new technologies, tourism managers no longer have a
complete control over the development of destination brand, since various communication tools
enable for residents to engage in the destination branding process. This calls for rethinking the
role of residents in destination branding and the necessity to explore various place attachment
dimensions and their outcomes.
Findings – This study proposes a conceptual framework to understand the role of residents in the
construction of the image of their place of residence as a tourism destination. Within this
framework, we suggested that place satisfaction may affect residents’ internalisation process,
contributing to residents’ behavioural output process, resulting in positive word-of-mouth,
participation in tourism activities, and demonstration of destination ambassador behaviour.
Originality – Despite the wide interest of researchers in human-place relationship, few studies
have focused on residents’ place attachment and its outcomes. This framework suggests that it is
important to understanding how residents form place attachment; how they perceive their place
of residence as a tourism destination, and what they communicate in order to create positive
destination image and strong destination brand.",,,,"Chen, N., Šegota, T. (2015) Resident attitudes, place attachment and destination branding: a research framework.

It is a journey worth recounting because it reveals how starkly our administrative law has changed over a short, finite period of time.  The transformative nature of this change beguiled some into believing that judicial review was a strictly post-war phenomenon.  This was palpably not so; judicial review has an absorbing history reaching back to the early jurisdiction of the Court of King’s Bench. 

This article critiques nine judicially-constructed dichotomies that dominated administrative law following the war.  These dichotomies were fixed and unforgiving, portraying administrative law as rigorous and analytical.  They lent respectability to a subject that naturally spawned suspicion.  Senior judges denounced the subject as “Continental jargon”  and the work of “academicians”.   The irony is that the dichotomies employed to invigorate the subject were transparently false.

Design: Cross-sectional survey implemented two years after the introduction of publicly-funded homebirthing models.
Setting: Two public hospitals in Victoria, Australia.
Participants: Midwives and doctors (obstetric medical staff).
Main outcome measures: Midwives’ and doctors’ views regarding reasons women choose homebirth; and views and experiences of a publicly-funded homebirth program, including intrapartum transfers.
Findings: Of the 44% (74/167) of midwives who responded to the survey, the majority (86%) supported the introduction of a publicly-funded homebirth model, and most considered that there was consumer demand for the model (83%). Most thought the model was safe for women (77%) and babies (78%). These views were stronger amongst midwives who had experience working in the program (compared with those who had not). Of the 25% (12/48) of doctors who responded, views were mixed; just under half supported the introduction of a publicly-funded homebirth model, and one was unsure. Doctors also had mixed views about the safety of the model. One third agreed it was safe for women, one third were neutral and one third disagreed. Half did not believe the homebirth model was safe for babies. The majority of midwives (93%) and doctors (75%) believed that intrapartum transfers from home to hospital were easier when the homebirthing midwife was a member of the hospital staff (as is the case with these models).
Key conclusions and implications for practice: Responding midwives were supportive of the introduction of publicly-funded homebirth, whereas doctors had divergent views and some were concerned about safety. To ensure the success of such programs it is critical that all key stakeholders are engaged at the development and implementation stages as well as in the ongoing governance.
Highlights:
• Midwives’ and doctors’ views of publicly-funded homebirth have not previously been
investigated.
• Midwives (in particular those who had experience working in the program) were very
supportive of publicly-funded homebirth for women and most considered there was
consumer demand for the model. Most believed the model was safe for women and
babies.
• Doctors had mixed views about publicly-funded homebirth. Some were supportive,
some considered there to be consumer demand, and some considered it to be a safe
model (others did not).",,,,"McLachlan, H, McKay, H, Powell, R, Small, R, Davey, M, Cullinane, F, Newton, M, Forster, D (2016) Publicly-funded Homebirth in Victoria, Australia: Exploring the Views of Midwives and Doctors.

This risk-adjusted bond yield spread is defined in a cross-country context and referred to as the GZ-type spread. Increases in the yield on corporate bonds issued in the countries on the periphery relative to the riskless yield (calculated using German zero-coupon term structure data) reflect increases in the risk premium that the financial market imposes on borrowers. The risk premium rises in all countries during European-wide recessions of the recent past, particularly those associated with the Global Financial and the Sovereign Debt Crisis. Our findings indicate further that this GZ-type spread acts as a reliable signal for imminent and near-term economic activity in countries where financial markets were shaken to their foundations during the Crisis period. For Germany, the GZ-spread has predictive content for industrial production but not for the unemployment rate.

"14399","10092/323","Sadiq, K.||Sawyer, A.",,,,,,,"2016",,"Recently, the Organisation for Economic Co‑operation and Development (OECD), at the invitation of G20 countries, developed what it refers to as the new single global standard for the automatic exchange of information (AEOI) between key revenue authorities worldwide. This standard, if adopted by a country, would require the annual AEOI relating to financial accounts obtained from financial institutions and exchanged in a common reporting format or standard. Theoretically, the adoption of the AEOI standard on a global scale would equip all countries to address the illicit flow of money to locations which result in tax avoidance and other forms of non‑compliance. However, the success of the AEOI standard relies on countries to be able to first, collect and supply the information required and second, effectively use and benefit
from the information provided to them. This means that such an adoption places an
onerous administrative burden on a country and this is arguably especially the case
for developing countries which do not have the same level of administrative resources
and intellectual capital as developed countries.

Studies have revealed that developing countries support the AEOI and view it as
an opportunity to address illicit financial flows. However, the implementation of
such a regime, according to the OECD, requires a sound legal framework, technical
know‑how, infrastructure and personnel capacity. Consequently, developing countries
are most concerned about the lack of capacity to: (1) collect the information locally to
allow full reciprocal information exchange; (2) analyse the information received; and
(3) deal with information technology. The purpose of this article is to critically analyse
the OECD’s AEOI standard and assess the standard from the perspective of developing
countries and emerging economies, including Global Forum members. It does so with
the aim of revealing the “unique” administrative and enforcement issues which may
arise for those countries and offering possible solutions. These possible solutions
offered adopt a case study approach to the Asia‑Pacific region.",,,,"Sadiq, K., Sawyer, A.

"3938","10092/323","Hopkins, W.J.",,,,,,,"2009",,"In November 2006, the New Zealand Law Commission and the Ministry of Justice launched
a joint program of tribunal reform in New Zealand. The aim of the project was to ‘provide a
final report on the issues involved in establishing a unified tribunal structure, including the
operational implications of the incremental inclusion of tribunals in the new structure’1 and
to ‘recommend a structure for existing tribunals as well as a framework for the establishment
of tribunals in the future’.2 This unusual joint endeavour was developed in incremental steps
through a series of reports published by both the Law Commission and the Ministry.3 The most
recent of these was published by the Law Commission late in 2008 and it is this document
which forms the basis for the following discussion.4 It is important to note at this point that this
report, although relatively comprehensive, was not intended to be the final document.5 Although
the project made clear the direction that the Law Commission intended to pursue (and some
elements of the reform had already been settled by Cabinet) it still remained at the stage of
recommendation, with further reports and discussion expected.
At the time of writing this paper, however, it would appear that this 2008 report is as far as
we are likely to get in the near future as the current government has put tribunal reform on ice.
Given the current state of the tribunal sector in New Zealand, which is explored below, this is
a disappointing but not entirely surprising development. Although the tribunal system in New
Zealand has been ripe for reform almost since the first tribunal was established, successive
attempts to introduce coherence to the ‘system’ have foundered in the difficult waters of the
legislative process. The failure to properly consider the place of tribunals in the New Zealand
legal system is an indictment of the political system rather than the tribunals themselves. From
their humble (and relatively late) beginnings in 1908, tribunals now handle the vast majority
of legally adjudicated disputes in New Zealand, particularly in the field of administrative law.
Most grievances against the state will be addressed, at least initially, by a specialist adjudicative
institution outside the formal court structure.6
Despite their fundamental importance to the delivery of justice in New Zealand, tribunals
remain a largely forgotten element of the legal system, at least amongst academics. In academia,
the tribunal is an unfashionable backwater, with few New Zealand texts giving more than
the most cursory coverage of these institutions.7 It should be no surprise then, given their astonishingly low profile in New Zealand, that tribunals remain largely unloved, unnoticed and
unreformed institutions. This article is a small attempt to turn the academic spotlight onto this
crucial element of New Zealand’s legal system, in the light of the Law Commission’s proposals
for reform.
Although this article uses the Law Commission’s proposals as its context, its underlying
themes are more generic. The Law Commission’s approach (influenced by the Ministry of
Justice) was to define tribunals as a single and distinct sector of the legal system. This sector,
thus defined, was subject to a series of overarching reform proposals to create a single tribunal
structure and a single legislative framework. The umbrella approach to tribunals, which is such
an integral part of the Law Commission’s proposals, is also reflected in the proposal to create
a pan-tribunal set of procedures aimed at giving greater coherence to the tribunal ‘system’.
This article argues that although the work of the Commission includes a number of positive
proposals, they reflect a fundamental misunderstanding of the place and role of tribunals in
the New Zealand legal system. Rather than seeing tribunals as a discrete system in need of
overall reform, it is argued that individual tribunals should be seen as part of specific systems
of specialist dispute resolution. For this reason they need to be considered in the context of
other dispute resolution and dispute avoidance mechanisms (both judicial and non-judicial).
This failure to put tribunals in their proper place is a phenomenon repeated (although to varying
degrees) in most common law jurisdictions and the approach of the Law Commission reflects
such overseas experiences. However, recent developments in the UK as a result of the Leggatt
Review of Tribunals8 and the later White Paper on Administrative Justice have seen a slow
recognition that tribunals are part of a system that needs to be focused primarily on getting
decisions right in the first instance rather than putting them right after the event.9
It is the submission of this author that New Zealand, and indeed most other jurisdictions
following the Westminster model, would benefit from such a return to first principles in
consideration of the role of tribunals. Such a functional analysis would lead both to a better
understanding of the role of tribunals in the legal system and allow us to construct more effective
systems of dispute resolution (and avoidance), particularly in the field of administrative law. It
may also lead us to the conclusion that a tribunal is not the most effective or efficient place to
ensure that these disputes are resolved and drive us to consider why they occur in the first place.",,,,"Hopkins, W.J. (2009) Order from Chaos? Tribunal Reform in New Zealand.

the concepts of supervening fraud and landlocked land. The paper concentrates solely on the
enforcement of the claim against the class of registered owners and uses two decisions
concerning a sub‐set of that class — the access‐blocking owner — to tease out the principles. The
claim will supersede supervening fraud, a principle that may be neither 'necessary [nor] consistent
with the statute'. The circumstances in which claims in personam are, and will be, recognised
are wide. This paper highlights well‐established known legal or equitable causes of action to
which the unconscionability of a registered owner may attach. The claim's relationship with ss
326‐331 of the Property Law Act 2007 adds a further dimension to the debate.
So how do the parties fare under the three concepts?
Both the Suttons and the McGraths clear the hurdles of supervening fraud and the in personam
claim. Had they resided in New Zealand, the McGraths would probably have successfully
defended a landlocked land application from the Campbells. However, Mr O'Kane would have dealt
his winning card and, pursuant to ss 326‐330 of the Property Law Act 2007, his access would have
been reinstated.

"4595","10092/323","Finn, J.||Wilson, C.",,,,,,,"2005",,"This article attempts to describe some aspects of the process of criminal justice in the early Canterbury settlement through the lens of the cases heard in the Supreme Court between 1852 and 1872. It is acknowledged that it is impossible to represent fully such a complex social phenomenon. Although
the criminal jurisdiction of the nineteenth century Supreme Court was in practice much wider than its modern counterpart, the High Court, the cases which came before the Court represent an unascertainable fraction of all
significant criminal conduct. Some offences were not reported by victims, others were not resolved by the detection or arrest of the offender. In a number of instances the authorities declined to prosecute; in others the matter was
decided in the Resident Magistrates' Court either by trying the case itself, or by refusing to commit the alleged offender to the Supreme Court.  Despite the existence of this filtering process, more than 700 cases did come before the Supreme Court during the two decades under study. A significant body of archival and newspaper material gives details of a
significant proportion of the cases tried, albeit with a degree of selectivity in the reporting which overemphasises some of the less common offences, such as murder, at the expense of less intriguing offences such as larceny or minor assaults. The value of the data is enhanced by the fact that for
some two-thirds of the period under study one judge, Henry Barnes Gresson, presided over all criminal trials. Provided the limitations of the data are remembered, it is possible to derive some useful insights about serious
criminal offending in Canterbury's formative years. The current study sets out some aspects of the manner in which the Court operated and considers the data as to criminal trials in its social and economic context. It then goes on to describe the main features of the offending which was dealt
with by the Court, and looks at some aspects of the different groups of individuals who appeared before the Court. The paper complements to some extent two other recent studies of the operation of the courts in early Canterbury, but it goes further than any previous study of the criminal justice
process in operation in Victorian New Zealand, both in the range of offences considered and the geographical area from which cases were drawn.",,,,"Finn, J., Wilson, C.

Studies in the academic literature, however, reach conflicting conclusions concerning which measure of inflation a central bank should target in a small open economy. This paper examines the properties of domestic, CPI, and real-exchange- rate-adjusted (REX) inflation targeting. In one class of open economy New Keynesian models there is an isomorphism between optimal policy in an open versus closed economy. In the type of model we consider, where the real exchange rate appears in the Phillips curve, this isomorphism breaks down; openness matters. REX inflation targeting restores the isomorphism but this may not be desirable. Instead, under domestic and CPI inflation targeting the exchange rate channel can be exploited to enhance the effects of monetary policy. Our results indicate that CPI inflation targeting delivers price stability across the three inflation objectives and will be desirable to a central bank with a high aversion to inflation instability. CPI inflation targeting also does a better job of stabilizing the real exchange rate and interest rate which is an advantage from the standpoint of financial stability. REX inflation targeting does well in achieving output stability and has an advantage if demand shocks are predominant. In general, the choice of the inflation objective affects the trade-offs between policy goals and thus policy choices and outcomes.",,,,"Froyen, R.T., Guender A.V. (2016) What to Aim for?

"14416","10092/323","Masselot, A.",,,,,,,"2016",,"How do we as teachers make European Union law
obviously relevant to students studying at a university
level in New Zealand? The relationship between
New Zealand and the European Union is strong and
important – from our trade relations to our partnership
in the Pacific; it is not hard to see a space for teaching
European Union law in New Zealand. Yet, the question
of how we improve students’ interest in this topic is
vital and difficult. There needs to be a balance between
teaching European Union law as something in and of
itself (the core content – the laws and processes), and
teaching the context for which it is useful to New Zealand law students. Integrating European Union
law with specific Asia-Pacific contextual issues such
as climate change, trade or regional integration has to
be the way forward.
One recommendation is to produce a New Zealand
student textbook or some European Union law
teaching materials relevant to New Zealand students.
Having resources which emphasis the New Zealand
(or even with the broader ambit of Asia-Pacific)
context is a current gap. A legal textbook for New
Zealand students learning European Union law would
be valuable and should highlight the context and
relevance of learning it. This would of course include
core content, but perhaps illustrate it with a New
Zealand themed example. For example, a New Zealand
company or government finance agency working in
the European Union. Further recommendations are
broader. The lack of motivation that lecturers find
in their students appears to be linked to a limited
foundational knowledge on the European Union, its
relationship to New Zealand, and thus influences the
attitude a student has towards a course. It is difficult
to recommend a way in which this might be mitigated.
However, it might be wise to consider providing more
elementary level courses, inviting recognised guest
lecturers, or undertaking a more flexible and adaptive
course model.
Teaching European Union law in New Zealand is
incredibly valuable. New Zealand’s relations with the
European Union are increasing in importance, and it
is vital that European Union law is thus understood by
New Zealanders.",,,,"Masselot, A. (2016) Kia kaha Europe: Teaching and Learning European Union Law in New Zealand.

for estimating policy impacts. It establishes that QECG estimators can outperform the conventional regression (CR) estimator when policy adoption is endogenous (nonrandom), the relationship between outcomes and policies is nonlinear, and CR

In the case of imperfect matching, QECG estimators will be biased. To address this and other issues, we develop a more general QECG estimator that (1) allows control places to be matched to more than one treatment place, and (2) weights observations by the “closeness” of the match. Using Monte Carlo analysis we demonstrate that our estimator substantially improves estimates of policy impacts.","Available online via ScienceDirect by subscription.",,,"Reed, W.R., Rogers, C.L.

Methods: Secondary data analysis of Timor-Leste Demographic Health Survey (1,959 ever-married women aged 15-49 years). Associations with violence estimated using multinomial logistic regression adjusted for sociodemographic variables and age of first intercourse. Results: Overall, 45% of ever-married women experienced violence: 34% reported physical only and 11% reported combined physical, sexual and/or emotional violence. Compared to non-abused women, women reporting physical violence only were more likely to use traditional contraception (AdjOR 2.35, 95%CI 1.05-5.26) or report: a sexually transmitted infection (AdjOR 4.46, 95%CI 3.27-6.08); a pregnancy termination (AdjOR 1.42, 95%CI 1.03-1.96); a child who had died (AdjOR 1.30, 95%CI 1.05-1.60), a low birth weight infant (AdjOR 2.08, 95%CI 1.64-2.64); and partially vaccinated children (AdjOR 1.35, 95%CI 1.05-1.74).

I will argue that the non-entrenched NZBRA, while traditionally subject to significant criticism, may now present a favourable world model for the effective democratic protection of substantive human rights. The anti-terror actions taken by the United States (U.S) and the United Kingdom (U.K.) following the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001 appear to give rise to a swing in human rights ideology. These acts represent a different form of human rights derogation from that which has traditionally been accepted. Apart from a small number of fundamental or core rights human rights are most often subject to some form of compromise within domestic systems of right protection. Notwithstanding this observation, the actions of the U.S. and the U.K., post September 11, appear to usher in a new form of compromise based upon state or community necessity. This new form of compromise has the potential to significantly modify the nature of traditional human rights ideology from the inviolable supremacy of an individual’s rights to the supremacy of broader democratic, structural or societal rights. Consequently, if such a shift were to solidify to the extent that derogations from the protection of an individual’s fundamental rights were held to be legitimate where society is faced with any type of amorphous threat, then a corresponding shift in appreciation of entrenchment versus non-entrenchment would also likely occur. The result would therefore be that right protection systems traditionally seen as weak, such as in operation within New Zealand and the U.K. could be seen as providing greater right protection through their promotion of intra-constitutional activity. Entrenched systems on the other hand, could lose favour as their rigid and concrete procedural protections provide little flexibility and therefore little intra-constitutional encouragement to executive administrations.",,,,"Gallavin, C.

more trainers exerting less-than-full effort in such races. These results
continue to hold when low-information races are excluded from the
sample, thereby ruling out the possibility that stake is simply a proxy
for the level of information that is available to bettors. Moreover, in
a sub-sample of 4416 races for which final odds data are available, the
dispersion in odds is positively related to race stake, consistent with
rational bettors recognising the incentives faced by trainers and incorporating this insight in their investments. As a group, horse trainers

By contrast, ESO holders are frequently required to hold portfolios that are over-exposed to the firm that employs them and so adopt exercise policies that reflect their individual risk preferences. Applying the model of Ingersoll (2006) to hypothetical ESOs, we show that ESO cost can be extremely sensitive to employee characteristics of risk aversion and under-diversification. This result casts doubt on the usefulness of any market-based model for pricing ESOs, since such models, by definition, produce option values that are independent of employee characteristics.

writing in the field remains scanty. Much of what has been written over
the years is invaluable in that it creates an accessible public record of
events, institutions or the activities of individuals. Relatively few of the
older writings display to any significant degree any attempt at analytical
history of law and legal development - perhaps because much of the
extant corpus is written for lawyers by lawyers; other works are on occasion
limited because non-lawyer authors have not managed to master the legal
issues involved in the events of which they write. Judicial biography is a
specialised form of legal history, and in the limited number of biographies [2]
of New Zealand judges so far published, instances of both these difficulties
may be found. But these are not the reasons for scholars to take care with
biographical writings. In New Zealand, as in most other Western countries,
judicial biography is often undertaken by persons with familial or personal
relationships to the subject of their study. [3] Such accounts are often what
Posner calls ""edifying' accounts - that is they are designed to provide
models or antimodeis for the reader's own life; [4] others are attempts to lay
a claim to the subject's place in history. Critical appraisal cannot be expected
to form any significant element in such writings. [5] Total objectivity may
not be expected of any biographer [6] but without some approach thereto the
resultant biography is of but limited value for later scholars.",,,,"Finn, J.N. (1997) Sir Kenneth Gresson: a study in judicial decision making.

known as the Legislative Council. On the transfer of sovereignty, however,
the elected Legislative Council was replaced by an appointed Provisional
Legislative Council. Within days the legitimacy of this body was challenged
in the courts of Hong Kong. Three accused in a conspiracy case argued
that the common law, under which they were charged, had, with the end of
British rule, ceased to be a part of the law of Hong Kong. This argument
led Hong Kong's Court ofAppeal, in HKSAR v Ma Wai-kwan, David1, to

same frictions would cause it to commence prematurely. Thus, hedging can have the paradoxical
effect of reducing investment. We also show that greater timing flexibility increases
the optimal quantity of hedging, but has a non-monotonic effect on the additional value

demands for bi-lateral control over the introduction of technology into the
workplace. In New Zealand Federated Clerical and Office Staff Employees
I.A.W. v Wellington Law Practitioners I.U.E. the Arbitration Court was
asked to arbitrate on the clerical and office staff employees' demand for a
right to bargain over the introduction of word processing machines.[1]
Observing the new micro-electronic technology to be ""of great moment in
industrial relations"" affecting ""many and varied fields"", the Court gave a
carefully considered decision explaining that it could not sanction the
demand. As an acknowledged test-case justifying the Court's departure
from its practice of not providing reasons for its decisions on purely
arbitral matters,[2] this decision establishes the precedent the Court will
follow in dealing with worker demands to mitigate the effects of technological
change. This is notwithstanding the Court's caution that it is not
bound by any factual precedent in matters of arbitration[3] (expressed also
in the Memorandum to the Award[4]). In this instance the Court's reasons
for rejecting the union's demand constitute a jurisdictional barrier to award
terms securing bi-lateral control, which effectively negates the freedom the
Court reserved to modify its approach in future proceedings beyond the
terms of the Law Practitioners Award.
In view of the technology clause sanctioned, Part I1 of this article
examines the range of claims the Court's ruling will allow workers -
irrespective of individual industry requirements-to pursue in conciliation
and arbitration. Discussed also are the residual statutory alternatives availing
workers actually confronting employer decisions to install new technology.
Part I provides the background. This examines the legal question
which, despite much of the Court's discussion of economic matters,[5]
was the principal issue for decision: namely, whether the subject of the
union's demand was an industrial matter within the meaning of the Industrial
Relations Act 1973[6] capable of satisfying the Act's jurisdictional
requirement. In view of the Industrial Court's ruling on this requirement only three years previously,[7] it suffices to mention that the Arbitration
Court's decision on the new technology was predictable.",,,,"PA Joseph and J Hughes (1981) Is Technology a Bargaining Issue?.

mid 1970's there has been an ever growing use of reservation of property
(Romalpa) clauses in commercial contracts for the sale of goods. The concept of a reservation of property clause is grounded in sections 19 and 21 of the Sale of Goods Act 1908 but its widespread use is a recent phenomenon.
The problem to be addressed here concerns the relationship of such clauses
to the Chattels Transfer Act 1924. The question is whether such clauses fall
within the ambit of the definition in section 2 of the Chattels Transfer Act
of ""instrument"" or the exclusions from the term ""instrument"". If they fall
within the latter then they are exempt from the registration provisions of
the Chattels Transfer Act. If this is so, it enables those purchasing on such
terms to give a misleading impression of their substance to other creditors
who may extend credit facilities in reliance on what appears to be ownership
by the purchaser of substantial stock in trade. In the event of the purchaser's
bankruptcy, the supplier under a contract containing a reservation of property clause can recover his goods possibly leaving very little property to be realised for the benefit of the unsecured creditors.",,,,"Scragg, R.

of law, with some notable exceptions, have sat rather isolated from those who study the
domestic legal order. The discourses of public and public international law, with some notable exceptions, rarely come into contact with each other. Each has its own sphere of knowledge, its
own principles and its own rules. Those who study and analyse these rules and the principles behind them may exchange pleasantries at conferences and even the odd conversation in the
faculty common room but the two sub-species of the genus droiticus publicus do not normally interact. They are happy in their ignorance. The onset of 'globalisation' and the use of supranational
institutions to create policy with a domestic element are forcing the barrier between
domestic and international spheres of law to be gradually reassessed. For the public lawyer such changes require a greater knowledge of the institutions of the supra-national level that are
playing an increasingly influential role in developing policy at the domestic sphere. For the international lawyer the change is, if anything, even more profound. Public international law has largely shied away from engaging with traditional public law concepts such as accountability
and democracy. Now that international decisions are having such an impact on the domestic sphere good governance demands that the principles applied to domestic decision-making must
be applied more generally.
The 'internationalisation' of public law is a topic far too wide to tackle in any great depth here. This short work instead focuses on an aspect of this wider phenomenon that is likely to prove of increasing relevance as the globalisation trend continues. By using international obligations to create domestic regulations domestic institutions previously charged with such a role have been bypassed. The clear loser in such a development is the national legislature. The
democratic deficit at the heart of the EU has become the classic example of this phenomenon.
However, a second, less acknowledged democratic deficit applies to sub-national governments in relevant states.",,,,"Hopkins, J.

Statutory modification has been achieved in Israel and in two Australian states. Now the question of reform has arisen in New Zealand with the Report on Privity of Contract presented to the Attorney-General by the Contracts and Commercial Law Reform Committee

Design/methodology/approach – Drawing on the affect and satisfaction literature, the paper examines affective reactions to service delivery within multi-national and regional corporate legal services markets. A two-stage methodology is adopted incorporating explorative interviews and a survey comprising 252 users of corporate legal services. 

Findings – Findings suggest the customer's ability to form expectation and performance assessments about the core service may have a moderating influence on affective reactions within a business-to-business credence service context. Customers of differing expertise will vary in the way they set service expectations and evaluate service delivery in relation to the technical, functional and affective components. 

Practical implications – Organisations should devote effort to devising appropriate service delivery processes that are pertinent to the individual customer. This in turn has implications for the recruitment, training and empowerment of employees in credence services that have traditionally focused on technical qualifications and experiential knowledge as the key drivers of human resource management strategies such as recruitment and reward systems. 

Originality/value – This paper contributes towards an understanding of the role of customer expertise on affect evoked within business-to-business credence services.",,,,"Garry, T.

"3749","10092/323","New Zealand. Law Commission.",,,,,,,"2006",,"Pacific leaders frequently refer to two significant objectives – maintaining local
values and custom and implementing universal, human rights. This study is
about achieving both objectives. Both custom and specific human rights are embedded in many Pacific
constitutions or statutes, yet the two concepts are often perceived as conflicting.
From one perspective, human rights are seen as a threat to custom and the
Pacific way of life, while from another perspective custom is seen as a threat to
individual freedom and justice. Constitutions and court judgments can contribute
to this polarisation by proposing that custom should trump human rights or,
alternatively, that human rights should trump custom. The focus of our study is the practical operation of justice mechanisms, including
both the courts and the wide range of community justice bodies found in the
Pacific. We also consider the relationship between custom and the state.
How the legislature and courts approach custom is critical in view of their role
in determining how custom and human rights are applied. Custom and
state-made law coexist within the state, but the state may modify the customary
legal system by statute within any limits imposed by the constitution.An underlying but nevertheless critical aspect of our work is that development
of a Pacific jurisprudence will only occur as Pacific nations find ways to better
integrate these two sources of law. The rule of law can only be effective in each
country to the extent that the law is owned by the people. Ownership is difficult
to achieve if the legacy of colonial legal systems, whether British, American,
French or international legal norms, are seen as alien to custom and customary
sources of law.The legal systems of each Pacific Island nation are complex and under strain
from a range of political, social and economic problems. The resources for
addressing the problems are very limited. Our study convinces us that supporting
and building on the legal infrastructures is vital, with implications for the future
that go beyond this study of human rights and custom.Custom provides Pacific nations with much of their sense of identity and with
vital governance and dispute-resolution mechanisms. Human rights provide
Pacific people (especially the most vulnerable) with protection and support for
realising their aspirations. A harmonising approach will strengthen legal systems
and the development of jurisprudence unique to Pacific states.",,,,"Law Commission (2006) Converging Currents: Custom and Human Rights in the Pacific.

He has stoically resisted the onslaught of academic, judicial and extra-judicial writings on the common law foundations of judicial review. With fortitude, he has defended the conceptual linkage of ultra vires and shunned argument about judicial power being deeply embedded in the common law. Again, in the pages of this review, Dr Forsyth joins with Linda Whittle in defence of the ultra vires doctrine - as establishing the one true constitutional justification of judicial review.[1] He reaffirms what he and his followers dub the 'modified doctrine of ultra vires'.

This reply identifies the strained logic of the (so-called) modified doctrine and refutes the forced reconciliation it attempts. The title of this reply refers to the writer's article, 'The Demise of Ultra Vires - Judicial Review in the New Zealand Courts' (hereafter 'The Demise of Ultra Vires').[2] That article recorded the debate over ultra vires in the United Kingdom and observed the emergence of a methodology of judicial review (termed 'constitutional review')[3] that demonstrates the potency of the courts' inherent jurisdiction at common law. This reply summarises the modified doctrine of ultra vires and addresses the writers' specific arguments of refutation against (as they quaintly put it) 'a voice from New Zealand'. Their article is a revised version of a presentation Dr Forsyth gave to the Public Law class at the University of Canterbury in September 2001, in which he repeatedly directed aquestion at the judges: 'Who areyou [the judge] to interfere in the exercise of a discretion entrusted to a democratically accountable decision-maker by a democratically elected Parliament?'[4] I am happy to oblige Dr Forsyth, although I question whether these or any other words are capable of shaking his resolve.

To presage what follows: the ultra vires doctrine is ahistorical in its claim to clothe the courts with constitutional justification, is artificial in its linkage to presumed parliamentary intent, is misty-eyed in its deference to popular democracy, and is perverse in reserving to the courts a servile, mechanistic role. The opening pages of this reply rehearse some of the arguments already canvassed in the debate. The article to which Forsyth and Whittle refer ('The Demise of Ultra Vires') contains a fuller account of the contortions of ultra vires scholarship.[5] The ensuing pages of this article probe the relationship of the political and judicial branches and take the debate into new territory concerning statutes and common law method.",,,,"Joseph, P.

importance. However in an era of increased mobility, attributable in part
to the quest for employment opportunities, it is not uncommon for the
custodial parent to seek to move towns or countries. In such situations a
Court is confronted with the difficult task of determining whether the
benefits of access are so compelling in the particular case that the wish of
the custodial parent to move must be denied.
In New Zealand, as in Australia, Canada, and England, issues on custody
and access are controlled by the paramountcy principle, albeit in slightly
differing forms, and any decision is inevitably particularised and dependent
on its own facts. Nonetheless, a study of the cases from the various

hyperlipidemia (NOHL) among patients wait-listed and after transplantation may impact costs and graft-survival of
patients with kidney disease. Methods: Using the United States Renal Data System, we compared the costs to Medicare
associated with or without NOHL in wait-listed patients in the second and first year pre-transplant and transplanted
patients in the first and second year post-transplant. We also examined the impact on graft-survival of NOHL. Results:
New onset hyperlipidemia was especially expensive when it occurred well before transplantation. When compared with
individuals with no hyperlipidemia, patients with early onset hyperlipidemia cost an extra $15,228 in the two years before
transplantation and an extra $14,673 in the two years following transplantation. As has been found in prior studies,
patients without any NOHL had the worst graft survival rates. Conclusions: Although NOHL was associated with
increased pre- and post-transplant costs, patients diagnosed with NOHL between the second year before and second year
after transplantation experienced higher graft-survival rates than those without NOHL by 2-years post-transplantation.

worse outcomes.",,,,"Woodward, R.S.,  Page, T.F,  Menclova, A.,  Schnitzler, M.A., Brennan,  D.C.

Methods - Screening for colorectal cancer using biennial immunochemical faecal occult blood tests offered to people aged 50–74 years of age was modelled using population estimates from Statistics New Zealand for 2011–2031. Modelling to determine colonoscopy requirements was based on participation and test positivity rates from published results of screening programmes. Estimates of the number of procedures required for ongoing adenoma surveillance were calculated using screening literature results of adenoma yield, and New Zealand Guidelines for Adenoma Surveillance. Sensitivity analysis was undertaken on key parameters. 
Results -  For a test positivity of 6.4%, biennial screening using immunochemical faecal occult blood testing with a 60% participation rate, would require 18,000 colonoscopies nationally, increasing to 28,000 by 2031. The majority of procedures are direct referrals from a positive FOBT, with surveillance colonoscopy numbers building over time. 
Conclusion - Colonoscopy requirements for immunochemical faecal occult blood based population screening for colorectal cancer are high. Significant expansion of services is required and careful management of surveillance procedures to ensure timely delivery of initial colonoscopies whilst maintaining symptomatic services. A model re-run informed by data from the screening pilot will allow improved estimates for the New Zealand setting.",,,,"Green, T., Richardson, A., Parry, S.

strategy tools are used in practical situations.
Design/methodology/approach – Draws on post-experience teaching and uses conceptual
reasoning to propose a typology of tool applications.
Findings – The paper finds that strategy tools need to be used differently according to the problem
needs, and hence proposes five generic modes of tool application. These draw on seven dimensions to
codify the functions and cognitive characteristics in a given tool application.
Research limitations/implications – The modes of application are conceptually rather than
empirically derived. The paper provides conceptual background that could be used in much-needed
empirical work on tool use in the strategy activity.
Practical implications – The typology could be used in teaching or facilitation to encourage and help
with the design of tool adaptations that are coherent and well adapted to the situation. It provides ameans
for prior reflection on tool choice and application that could help reduce detrimental framing effects.
Originality/value – The paper highlights the centrality of user adaptation of tools and begins to
codify the effects of tool enactment. It moves debate from the tools themselves to the application of
tools, which has seldom been addressed in a systematic fashion. For practitioners it provides explicit
guidance on the tool adaptation process.",,,,"Knott, P. (2006) A typology of strategy tool applications.

Usually a leak involves a person who works for the government, a private organisation or for another individual publishing information that belongs to their employer and which they only know because of their employment relationship, to someone else who is not entitled to have it.  This sort of activity is covered by the law called breach of confidence. This is not a criminal offence, but rather is a civil (or private) claim which one party brings against another.  Third parties who receive such information and pass it on even though they know it is confidential, or even if they simply should know it is confidential, may also be breaching confidence.

When firms list equities on more than one exchange, and the exchanges are characterized by different information sets, a problem arises as to which exchange(s) to include in the event study sample. If market segmentation impedes the arbitrage of these multiple responses, then the use of a single listing (for a firm that is cross-listed) can yield abnormal return estimates that are biased. In such circumstances, using returns from all the markets in which a firm's securities are listed not only increases the sample size (often an important consideration when undertaking event studies in emerging markets), but also enables full-information abnormal return estimates to be obtained. What is required is a method that extracts the independent information from each listing while counting the common information only once. In this paper, we develop an estimation procedure that achieves these twin objectives. We then apply our approach to an event study of Chinese overseas mergers and acquisitions, and compare results from alternative samples and estimators. We demonstrate that including return data from cross-listings of the same firm can result in substantially different conclusions.",,,,"Gu, L., Reed, W.R.

sharemarket crash, the instances of businesses and individuals alike facing
insolvency in New Zealand has escalated at an unprecedented rate. A large

individuals under the Insolvency Act 1967. Accompanying the growth in
bankruptcies was a desire to avoid the restrictions and utilise alternatives
to satisfy the demands of creditors. One such alternative is a proposal
under Part XV of the Insolvency Act or an arrangement under Part X of
the Bankruptcy Act 1966 (C'th). Utilisation of proposals as an alternative
to bankruptcy has mirrored the growth in insolvencies in New Zealand if
the number of judicial decisions is taken as the measure.
This article investigates and critically evaluates proposals filed under
Part XV of the Insolvency Act 1967. Proposals were first introduced with
the 1967 consolidation and amendment to the Insolvency Act 1956. Part
XV of the Insolvency Act provides the procedure for securing creditor

do not own them and who have come into possession of them without the consent or knowledge of the owner of them. Such claims may be made, typically, where goods which have been lost by their owner are found by someone who takes possession of them; or
where goods have been stolen and are in the possession of the thief or a person who has
received or taken them from the thief. In such cases, of course, the proprietary title of the
owner remains paramount but, in the absence of an owner to assert such a claim, the
question of entitlement to found or stolen goods may be disputed by other parties who have
taken possession of the goods, dealt with them in some way or had some relation to them. In
such disputes, legal proceedings, usually in conversion, may be undertaken by the plaintiff
with the purpose of establishing an interest in the goods sufficient to prevail over any claimed
interest of the defendant.1 The purpose of this paper is to discuss the interests involved in
cases of found and stolen goods, and to describe the way in which the law deals with rival
claims in such cases. The nature of the possessory right necessary to found a successful
conversion action in the absence of the true owner of goods is central to such a discussion, and
an attempt will be made to analyse the principles involved in this context in establishing such a
right. In particular, this paper revisits and questions the correctness of the reasoning in Costello
v Chief Constable of Derbyshire,2 which equated the interests of finders, thieves and other
wrongdoers; and concludes that the decision failed to make the necessary distinction between
the respective rights in goods of finders, thieves and others who are in possession of unlawfully obtained goods.",,,,"Hawes, C.

The major recommendation of the Committee was the introduction of a close corporation and the abolition of the exempt proprietary company.

The Supreme Court delivered a long-awaited privacy decision, which unfortunately added little clarity to the state of the developing tort, or to privacy law generally. However, the Court also delivered an important Bill of Rights judgment which media lawyers should familiarise themselves with, as constitutionalisation of both statute and common law continues a pace. Further, the Supreme Court applied this case in a further decision where it discussed both freedom of expression and privacy in relation to the right to protest, finding that the former trumped the latter in a close decision.
The Broadcasting Standards Authority struggled with matters of good taste and decency, but continued to be protective of privacy.

internal sources of competitive performance. It seeks to enhance the contribution of the widely diffused value-rarity-imitability-organisation (VRIO) model to practical strategy making.
Design/methodology/approach – The paper draws on the resource-based literature to assemble
an integrated set of steps that evaluate a firm’s resources and competence.
Findings – The paper proposes an expanded version of the VRIO model that represents resource and competence as a conditional outcome from attributes and asymmetries present in the firm. It shows how the conditions convert asymmetries between weaknesses, missed opportunities, rigidities and resources.
Research limitations/implications – By synthesising resource-based theory in a practice-relevant
form, the paper delineates a concrete set of practices that relate to firms’ dynamic capability to manage resources and competence.
Practical implications – The paper details an approach to resource and competence analysis that
leads directly to decisions about how a firm can manage the resources in question. The model gives a central role to the conditions under which a firm’s attributes give rise to a resource or competence, and hence suggests active management of these conditions.
Originality/value – The paper presents resource-based theory in a form that focuses on the doing of strategy, in contrast to the traditional focus of this literature.",,,,"Knott, P.

In contrast, quality and lean programmes actively encourage operators to acts of intervention and personal agency in the improvement of production outcomes. This creates a conflict that requires operator judgement: How does one differentiate between unnecessary tampering and needful intervention? Also, difficult is that operators apply tacit knowledge to such judgements. There is a need to determine where in a given production process the operators are applying tacit knowledge, and whether this is hindering or aiding quality outcomes. The work involved the conjoint application of systems engineering, statistics, and knowledge management principles, in the context of a case study. Systems engineering was used to create a functional model of a real plant. Actual plant data were analysed with the statistical methods of ANOVA, feature selection, and link analysis. This identified the variables to which the output quality was most sensitive. These key variables were mapped back to the functional model. Fieldwork was then directed to those areas to prospect for operator judgement activities. A natural conversational approach was used to determine where and how operators were applying judgement. This contrasts to the interrogative approach of conventional knowledge management. Data are presented for a case study of a meat rendering plant. The results identify specific areas where operators’ tacit knowledge and mental model contribute to quality outcomes and untangles the motivations behind their agency. Also evident is how novice and expert operators apply their knowledge differently. Novices were focussed on meeting throughput objectives, and their incomplete understanding of the plant characteristics led them to inadvertently sacrifice quality in the pursuit of productivity in certain situations. Operators’ responses to the plant are affected by their individual mental models of the plant, which differ between operators and have variable validity. Their behaviour is also affected by differing interpretations of how their personal agency should be applied to the achievement of production objectives. The methodology developed here is an integration of systems engineering, statistical analysis, and knowledge management. It shows how to determine where in a given production process the operator intervention is occurring, how it affects quality outcomes, and what tacit knowledge operators are using. It thereby assists the continuous quality improvement processes in a different way to SPC. A second contribution is the provision of a novel methodology for knowledge management, one that circumvents the usual codification barriers to knowledge management.",,,,"Van Gestel, P., Pons, D., Pulakanam, V.

information theory. Our entropy metric is employed to devise rules for problem partitioning within an implicit enumeration method, where branching is accomplished based on the subproblem complexity. The only requirement for applying our metric is the availability of (upper) bounds on branching subproblems, which are often computed within most implicit enumeration methods such as branch-and-bound (or cutting-plane-based) methods. Focusing on problems with a relatively small number of constraints, but with a large number of variables, we develop a hybrid partitioning and enumeration solution scheme by combining the entropic approach with the recently developed improved surrogate constraint (ISC) method to produce the new method we call ISCENT.  Our computational results indicate that ISCENT can be an order of magnitude more efficient than commercial solvers, such as CPLEX, for convex instances with no more than eight constraints. Furthermore, for nonconvex instances, ISCENT is shown to be significantly more efficient than other standard global solvers.",,,,"Nakagawa, Y., James, R.J.W., Rego, C., Edirisinghe, C.

The study finds that (i) the hazards for different insolvency outcomes are neither equal nor proportionate; (ii) the model for generic insolvency events and the models for outcome-specific insolvency events feature different significant factors, which are not due to random variations; and (iii) the outcome-specific insolvency models exhibit better forecast performance than the generic insolvency model within a five-year forecast horizon.

The result is a series of inconsistencies which give the law in this context a generally incoherent and disjointed feel.   This article looks at three separate instances of criminalisation – false statements and other misconduct in public offers of securities, breaches of certain directors’ duties in company law, and cartel conduct under the Commerce Act 1986 – and provides a compare-and-contrast type discussion.

contents of sustainability reporting communicated through the websites of the plants in five 
continents of the same multinational mining corporation. 


Design/methodology/approach – This study uses data published by Newmont Mining 
Corporation. The corporation has regional headquarters in five continents: Africa, Asia, 
Australia and North America and South America. The data were drawn from the websites of 
the five plants adjacent to those regional headquarters. Economic, environmental and social 
aspects of sustainability as reported by each plant were identified; to do so, a disclosure 
analysis based on the elements of the Global Reporting Initiative and the United Nations 
Division for Sustainability Development was used. These aspects were then compared and 
contrasted to highlight if, and to what extent, institutional isomorphism influences variations 
in sustainability disclosures among plants compared with the parent company.


Findings – It was found that most of the reporting about sustainability matters comprises 
narratives; there were also a few physical measures but very little financial information. 
Notwithstanding that the websites of all five plants used similar headings, the contents of 
reports differed. The reports from the plants in Australia, South America and Africa were 
more comprehensive than those from the plants in Asia and North America. The authors 
attribute these differences to institutionalisation of location-specific characteristics, including 
management discretion, legislation and societal pressures influencing sustainability reporting. 
The authors argue that managers responsible for preparing sustainability reports and who 
work essentially as sustainability accountants should develop templates and measures to raise 
the standard and comprehensiveness of reports for improved communication, information and 
behaviour.


Originality value – Extant studies on sustainability reporting have focused mainly on 
comparisons between sustainability reports published by different corporations or 
sustainability reports published in different years by the same corporation. The authors 
believe that this is one of the first studies to have examined differences in sustainability 
information published by different subsidiaries within the same large corporation and the first 
to show how concurrent disclosures can differ.",,,,"Amoako KO, Lord BR, Dixon K (2017). Sustainability reporting: Insights from the websites of five plants operated by Newmont Mining Corporation.

"17860","10092/323","Tofangaz, Hamed",,,,,,,"2015",,"Purpose - The approach taken by international laws and standards to impede terrorism treats terrorist financing as another form (predicate crime) of money laundering. This approach justifies the integration of terrorist financing into money laundering counter-measures with an exaggerated focus on two inaccurate assumptions: terrorists’ involvement in criminal activities (especially organized crime), and utilising money laundering tools by terrorists to move their funds. Regarding the nature and characteristics of terrorist financing, this paper aims to examine whether from a factual standpoint, it is sufficiently reasonable to address the suppression of terrorist financing by analogy with money laundering.
Design/ Methodology/ Approach – The process of terrorist financing will be examined in regard to the funding requirements of terrorists and the methods and tools that terrorists use to raise, move and store their funds. The process of money laundering will be compared with terrorist financing. The role of money laundering in terrorist financing will be discussed. In the core part of this paper, the assumptions justifying the inclusion of anti-money laundering measures to terrorist financing will be challenged.
Findings – What terrorist financing and money laundering share in common is money. However, there are fundamental differences between them with regard to the sources of funds and the direction of financial flows. None of the elements _‘accumulation’ and ‘legitimization’_ involved in money laundering are necessarily engaged in the process of terrorist financing. This questions the authenticity of the assumptions which underlie the adopted approach. It also requires further investigation on the effectiveness of the integrated counter-terrorist regime, which will not be covered by this paper.
Originality/ value – This paper provides a comprehensive introduction for those dealing with the greater question of whether the terrorist financing can and should be tackled by anti-money laundering measures.",,,,"Hamed Tofangsaz, (2015) ""Rethinking terrorist financing; where does all this lead?"", Journal of Money Laundering Control, Vol. 18 Issue: 1, pp.112-130, https://doi.org/10.1108/JMLC-12-2013-0049",,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/14524",,,"en",,,,,,,,,,,,"https://doi.org/10.1108/JMLC-12-2013-0049",,,,,"terrorism||money laundering||Terrorist financing",,,,"Rethinking terrorist financing; where does all this lead?",,,"Journal Article",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Fifty Shades of Grey is the acceptable book about BDSM (bondage and discipline, dominance and submission and sadism and masochism) sexual practices.

Classics like Lady Chatterley’s Lover,  Lolita, De Sade’s Justin, have been around for years, there are lots of them about, and they are accepted to be classics.   Fifty Shades is what could be described as an instant classic. The series has sold 350,000 copies here, and it’s been voted Number 5 in Whitcoulls’ top 100 list for 2012-2013.

In contrast, the Waitangi Tribunal has held the potential use of binding powers since 1989 for SoE lands and Crown Forest assets, but has only used these once.

"3785","10092/323","Finn, J.N.",,,,,,,"1983",,"In December 1982 the Criminal Law Reform Committee presented to the Minister of Justice a comprehensive report on bail and made many recommendations
for changes in the current law and practice in this area.
The primary recommendation of the Committee is that in a majority of circumstances there should be a statutory presumption in favour of bail.
The circumstances in which this presumption will operate and the factors to be taken into account in a decision as to whether it is rebutted will be discussed in detail.Although this writer has been critical of some of the detail of the proposed
reform, and the implementation of it may require attention to be
given to certain matters, it is undoubtedly capable of giving rise to a far
more coherent and balanced law of bail than we currently have. The
inclusion of the presumption in favour of bail, if it is preserved and
observed, indicates a desirable shift in favour of preserving the rights of
the accused person who has not yet been convicted. If nothing more comes
from the Report than a recognition that these rights are not properly protected
at present, the Report will have been a most valuable document.
The scheme for the review of bail decisions may also, if adequate reasons
are insisted on, allow for a relatively equitable and speedy procedure. It is
to be hoped that the Government will see fit to include bail reform in its
legislative programme in the near future; and that the strong points in the
Report are not reduced or removed to demonstrate the Government's
apparent wish to be seen as ""getting tough"" with those involved in the
criminal justice system.",,,,"Finn, J.N. (1983) Out on Bail - the Report of the Criminal Law Reform Committee on Bail.

The hierarchical model of competences in an organisation is useful in classifying and displaying skills, competences and core products, but is less useful in describing the functioning of competences.  This paper presents a new approach in which organisational factors, attributes of individuals and value delivered, are considered as elements of an operating system.

An unconstrained bank shrinks its deposit base in the wake of a capital loss if loan demand is very sensitive to the bank’s relative capital position. The deposits of an unconstrained bank expand only if both deposit and loan demands are fairly immune to a bank’s relative capital position. In a simple model with reserves we show that in the wake of a capital loss the adjustment of loans and reserves under a binding constraint depends on the parameters of the model while the adjustment of total assets and liabilities does not. Loans decrease by the size of the capital loss plus the increase in reserves. If the constraint is not binding then loans generally decrease by more than the increase in reserves.",,,,"Guender, A.V., Peng, Y. (2014) A Note on the role of bank capital.

The production staff believed the high levels of rejects were beyond their control and the product was unresolved when the product development (PD) team handed it over to them. On the other hand, the PD team believed the product was manufacturable and the production staff was incompetent and was not following the production procedures. With the application of statistical process control (SPC) the production rejects were reduced from more than 22 percent to less than 7 percent. Complete elimination of these rejects, however, was not possible because the production processes were incapable of producing the product. The PD team, when designing product, failed to consider manufacturability issues, and at the same time the production failed to follow the production processes.

The aim of this article was to report on the analysis of qualitative, open text data, received from a national on-line survey of what factors Generation Y New Zealand Registered Nurses wish to change about nursing and consideration of the potential policy and practice impacts of these requests on their retention.


Background:
Prior to the economic recession of 2007–2010, the growing shortage of nurses in New Zealand presented a serious concern for the healthcare workforce. Given the ageing New Zealand nursing workforce, an ageing population and the increasing demands for health care, it is imperative that issues of retention of Generation Y nurses are resolved prior to the imminent retirement of more experienced nurses.


Design:
A descriptive exploratory approach using a national wide, on-line survey, eliciting both quantitative and qualitative data was used.


Method


The survey, conducted from August 2009–January 2010, collected data from Generation Y New Zealand Registered Nurses (n = 358) about their views about nursing, work and career. Herzberg's Motivation-Hygiene theory was used as the framework for the analysis of the open text data.


Results


The factors that nurses wanted changed were skewed towards Herzberg's hygiene-maintenance factors rather than motivating factors. This is of concern because hygiene-maintenance factors are considered to be dissatisfiers that are likely to push workers to another employment option.",,,,"Jamieson, I., Kirk, R., Wright, S., Andrew, C.

In particular, it investigates the three board-design choices that Australian listed companies make in the context of ASX corporate governance principles (published in 2003) where they are allowed to depart from the recommended best-practice board structure if the departure better serves their unique board and governance requirements.
Design/Methodology:  A logistic regression is performed on a cross-section of data, averaged over the years 2004 to 2007, for 258 ASX listed companies, employing the company variables of size, age, leverage, ownership concentration, profitability, liquidity, price-earnings ratio, market-to-book ratio and cross-listing.
Findings:  The study finds that size has a strong, statistically significant impact on all three principles. Ownership concentration, price-earnings ratio and age have statistically significant impacts on the likelihood of compliance with at least one principle, but have no consistent influence on the remaining principles. This finding supports the underlying philosophy of the ASX Corporate Governance Principles that flexible guidelines serve companies better than inflexible rules.
Originality/Value:  This study breaks new ground in empirically investigating the effect of company variables on compliance with the ASX’s Principles of 2003, which are new for Australia in requiring an ‘if not, why not’ response from companies.",,,,"Lama, T., Anderson W.W.

When the BCA sued him, all sorts of prominent people, like Stephen Fry, PEN authors, etc, began to call for change to libel laws, although on rather confused grounds, it has to be said. The main complaints appeared to be about the outrageous cost of defending defamation actions, as well as suggestions that it is too easy for non-English nationals who don’t live in the UK to sue there.

"11506","10092/7541","Finn, J.N.",,,,,,,"2014",,"This paper will examine the curious disconnect between the character requirements for legal practice in New Zealand in the 19th century and financial support stability or security and the slow progression to a requirement of solvency if an individual was to practice as a barrister or solicitor. The latter was only imposed by sections 24 and 25 of the Law Practitioners Act 1955. The paper will first consider the position of a number of 29 identifiable insolvent lawyers in the 19th century, and how they appear to have been treated by their colleagues and by society generally. It then will examine the circumstances of the passage of the Law Practitioners Act 1892, which mandated the keeping of separate trust accounts, and the influential decision of the Court of Appeal in In re Bruges (1907)  26 NZLR 541. The paper then concludes by examining the reason for the changes made by the 1955 legislation and speculating why such provisions took so long to materialise and why insolvency has been ignored in writing about the New Zealand legal profession. 


In 1860 the Supreme Court judges were asked by the House of Representatives to report on matters relating to admission to the legal profession. The majority of the discussion is on matters relating to reciprocal admission rights, examinations in New Zealand law and other process issues.  Nothing was said about bankruptcy and its effect on rights to practice but the judges specifically referred to the desirability of enacting a clause similar to 6&7 Vic. C 73, s 5. That provision permitted a clerk who had commenced articles with one solicitor to transfer the articles to another employer for the balance of the article period if the first solicitor had “become bankrupt or insolvent or has been in prison for debt for  21 days”. It is therefore obvious that the possibility of a solicitor being bankrupt was well-known and was not regarded as necessarily preventing the first solicitor from continuing to practice his profession.",,,,"Finn, J.N.

In this paper I will provide an overview of why NZ’s GST has been so successful from a tax policy perspective, including its development and initial operation, along with more recent major policy reforms that have incorporated NZ’s unique (and well respected) Generic Tax Policy Process (GTPP). As Ward suggests I will argue that NZ’s approach to GST “deserves [Australia’s] close attention as a model for reform”.

"1172","10092/687",,,"Lefevre, Peggy",,,,,"2007",,"Chemical weapons are a threat to international security. According to an international convention, the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC), all chemical weapons fall under a stringent and irreversible disarmament regime that seeks the abolition of the use and existence of chemical weapons altogether. The CWC is considered to be the first verifiable disarmament treaty; furthermore, it targets an entire category of Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD).     Unfortunately there is a gap between the legal requirements of the CWC disarmament regime and its implementation. This gap between the theoretical and practical aspects of disarmament implies a practical, result-based approach to disarmament throughout this study; it raises doubts about the feasibility of chemical weapons disarmament under international law. The central question of this study is whether international law can achieve the effective disarmament of chemical weapons.      A background on the chemical weapons disarmament regime is provided in this study. The legal control of chemical weapons follows a clear evolution, from the ban on the use of chemical weapons in conflicts to the international consensus to disarm them altogether. Concerning the legal control for chemical weapons, questions arise about the type of instrument suited for effective disarmament.      As of August 2006 the CWC had been in force for nine years; it is considered to be a well-established treaty and benefits from a very broad membership. However, the disarmament of chemical weapons knows many political, technical and financial difficutlies. It is behind the schedule imposed by the CWC and weapons possessors struggle to meet the environmental and technical requirements provided in the CWC. Throughout this study these difficulties are examined and illustrated with case studies of the main weapons possessors. Such difficulties highlight numerous flaws in the legal regime, at the time of its constitution and during its implementation. Furthermore, they have serious implications for the credibility and authority of that regime.      The chemical weapons disarmament regime, as well as other traditional arms control and disarmament instruments, currently evolves in a changing international security environment that is characterized by new threats. The CWC is challenged by new national and international security policies which rely less on traditional legal instruments and more on alternative, political instruments. The role of treaties such as the CWC is questioned and challenged, which in turn threatens the continuation of and commitment in chemical weapons disarmament. This study concludes with an analysis of the evolution of the chemical weapons disarmament regime in this changing environment, and proposes alternatives and changes that are more suitable for achieving effective disarmament. While the weaknesses of the chemical weapons disarmament regime must be acknowledged, it remains a useful security tool; there are no grounds to question its existence entirely.",,,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/850",,,"en",,,"University of Canterbury.

Why measure organisational resilience? In crisis and disaster situations, organisations enable communities to respond and recover. Organisations that provide services such as electricity, telecommunications, transport, water and healthcare are commonly seen as critical. However all organisations contribute to the delivery of services and the provision of employment. The ability of these organisations to operate can determine the success of the community response and recovery.
Organisations, both big and small, are susceptible to natural disasters, power cuts, loss of key staff and public health issues like pandemic influenza. And it’s not just the big problems that can cause trouble for organisations; many experience small disruptions on a daily basis. A resilient organisation is one that not only survives, but is also able to thrive in an environment of change and uncertainty (Seville, et al., 2008, p. 2).
Initial results from this research indicate a positive relationship between organisational resilience and cash flow, profitability and return on investment. This provides evidence of a clear link between an organisation’s resilience and their business performance. Despite the business benefits of becoming more resilient, many organisations struggle to prioritise resilience and to link resilience to crisis or disaster, with the ability to operate effectively and efficiently during business as usual. Measuring and benchmarking organisational resilience is about two things, firstly asking ‘as an organisation how resilient are we and what do we need to work on?’, and secondly remembering that what gets measured gets done!","Resilient Organisations Research Report 2010/03b - updated version",,,"Stephenson, A., Seville, E., Vargo, J., Roger, D.

"3493","10092/687","Cheer, Ursula Jan",,,,,,,"2008",,"In 2001, I began the field work in an empirical study of the laws of defamation in New Zealand. This study involved a comprehensive mail-out survey of the New Zealand media, and an adapted survey of defamation lawyers, which were designed to discover how the laws of defamation affected both groups, and what the respondents thought about those laws. The survey was augmented by an extensive search of defamation court files in the most important New Zealand High Court registries. The question behind the survey was essentially whether New Zealand’s defamation laws have a chilling effect on the media, to the extent that stories which should be told do not see the light of day. 

In this thesis, I contextualise and report on the results of the survey. I first describe and analyse the sources and trends in current defamation law, the other forms of regulation of the media in New Zealand, and the patterns of media ownership. I go on to utilise background data from the survey to present a character and business profile of the media who responded to the survey and find the data confirms the representative nature of those respondents. I then complete contextualisation of the survey by analysing the nature of the chilling effect doctrine itself, a canon which began as a predictive theory importing sociological concepts into legal analysis, but which is now a doctrine applied somewhat inconsistently, but with substantive effects, by the courts. In the following chapters I present the results of the media survey, the court file search and the survey of defamation lawyers, both in narrative and graph or tabular form. My tentative initial finding, that New Zealand’s defamation laws do not have an excessive chilling effect on our media, although they do have some, is progressively confirmed, with each set of data appearing to mirror and corroborate that which went before. In the final chapters, I take this somewhat surprising finding and augment it by theorising about future developments in defamation law. I suggest that increased constitutionalisation of this area of private law, in the form of full incorporation of a Bill of Rights methodology, is both desirable and necessary to protect against any chilling effects, such as they are. I conclude by posing a question about a possible joint future for defamation and privacy claims.",,,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/3050",,,"en",,,"University of Canterbury.

The aim of the research was to ascertain whether current law, policy and practice are conducive to the rehabilitation and reintegration of offenders and the reduction of recidivist offending.  
As research shows that offenders who are able to obtain and retain employment are less likely to reoffend, the degree to which current measures facilitate ex-offender employment were examined in particular.  In this context, barriers faced by ex-offenders in obtaining and retaining employment were examined. 
The research methodology is primarily qualitative, using both primary and secondary information sources, formal and informal.  The research is also informed by a small scale survey of employer attitudes and direct observation by the writer of a community-based employment initiative.
The research suggests that viewing criminal offending through a “human needs” lens, whereby offender behaviours are seen as directed at the meeting of fundamental needs, provides an appropriate means of understanding and addressing criminal offending. 
The research concludes that current criminal justice policy lacks the types of measures necessary to rehabilitate and reintegrate ex-offenders.   Specifically, it is argued that there is need for “throughcare” (that is, continued support and assistance provided to ex-offenders upon sentence expiry) to be viewed as an integral part of the criminal justice system.",,,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/3515",,,"en",,,"University of Canterbury.

"7789","10092/687",,,"Farrar, A. A.",,,,,"1982",,"Statutes are a written communication between Parliament and the legislative audience. Statutory interpretation is the process whereby the legislative audience seeks to understand and thereby govern its actions by the dictates of Parliament. Judicial interpretation occurs only when there has been some breakdown in this process - either Parliament failed to express its ideas clearly or those ideas are incapable of precise expression. A broad aim of this thesis is to examine the functioning of language and the communication process with a view to understanding more clearly the nature of meaning and its ascertainment. An analysis will be made of those features of language giving rise to uncertainty and so to the problem case of interpretation. An analysis will also be made of the nature of linguistic certainty; it is hoped that a better understanding of the ingredients of successful communication will eventually lead to the reduction of statutory doubt. Next the theory of judicial interpretation will be considered and its correspondence to accepted linguistic theory assessed. Particular emphasis will be placed on a discussion of the adequacy of the traditional canons. Finally judicial practice will be considered by means of a survey conducted from two years of the New Zealand Law Reports. The results from this survey will then be compared with earlier findings from the thesis. Conclusions of a general nature will be drawn; in particular it will be submitted that a shift in the dominant paradigm applicable to the construction of statutes is presently under way in New Zealand. The traditional canons are being replaced by a more unified and consistent paradigm whose features include liberalisation of the literal rule to encompass consideration of context, including the statutory purpose, and explicit provision for assessment of consequences. This new paradigm is more adequate than the traditional canons and Section 5(j) both as a source of reasons for meaning and reasons for decision.",,,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/7216",,,"en",,,"University of Canterbury.

The research investigated these gendered, structural patterns of violence and the effectiveness of criminal justice interventions in keeping victims safe. Agency interactions with offenders and victims prior to women's deaths were reviewed in selected cases. Criminal law constructions of violence in intimate relationships were evaluated for their recognition and understanding of primary risk factors for dangerousness/lethality. The research found major red flags remain invisible in criminal law stereotypes of violence between intimates. The significance of these risk factors for dangerousness/lethality is therefore overlooked, misunderstood and even misrepresented in defence of violent offenders. Although the aim of the Domestic Violence Act 1995 is to ensure effective protection for victims, the study found a significant number of women (and sometimes other family members and children) experience further sub-lethal and lethal violence following legal interventions with perpetrators. Lacking a principled policy foundation, central focus on victim safety and clear framework for interventions, legal responses are internally incoherent and inconsistent with New Zealand Family Violence Prevention Strategy. The New Zealand government has committed to principled domestic violence intervention and consistency in law and policy. This will require: a) legislative reform; b) public and professional education on the dynamics of violent relationships, including the interrelationship between sublethal and lethal assaults; and c) monitoring of criminal justice interventions to improve accountability. Until this is accomplished, stories of abused women and their children, including informal attempts to seek help and contact with state and community agencies will continue to be dishonoured by a legal system which silences their voices and fails to learn lessons from their injuries and deaths.",,,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/849",,,"en",,,"University of Canterbury.

Today, Japan administers the islands, which are also claimed by Taiwan and the Peopleʼs Republic of China. All claimants use historical evidence to bolster the legal strength of their claim. The dispute over the islands is also linked to other important factors, such as nationalism in an unreconciled international environment and the rights to exploitation of natural resources. The unresolved Taiwan / China question puts another burden on its resolution. This particular conflict will be compared to other similar remote islands, which already have been subject to a legal procedure and, in some cases, resolution.

"5458","10092/687","Dawson, Richard Mark",,,,,,,"2010",,"This Thesis engages with the work of James Boyd White.  White’s principal books, which cannot be placed easily into conventional categories, give particular attention to an activity that we humans do all the time: constituting and reconstituting ourselves and our relations with others when we use, and in using transform, our language.  Attending to this activity, which I call ‘transformative constitutionalism’, opens up a line of inquiry into the kinds of selves and relations that we do, and could, and should constitute.  This inquiry lends itself to talking about justice as being concerned with constituting appropriate selves and relations.  White’s own inquiry, which resists monophonic speech and advocates polyphonic speech, has gone down this particular path.  This Thesis seeks to make sense of his travel and to provide a resource for tuning in to it.
At one level, this Thesis can be read as a response to an invitation in White’s course book The Legal Imagination.  Here White offers this ‘thesis’: ‘that the activities which make up the professional life of the lawyer and judge constitute an enterprise of the imagination, an enterprise whose central performance is the claim of meaning against the odds: the translation of the imagination into reality by the power of language.’  White invites ‘examination and response’ from his reader.  This Thesis takes up White’s invitation.
Following White’s encouragement, I speak out of an awareness of several sorts of material, including the literature of the law, literary criticism, my intellectual activity outside the law, and my ordinary experience of life.  Doing so offers a way of defining what he calls ‘intellectual integration’, the concern of which is wholeness of thought and experience.  For White, intellectual integration can serve as a model for social integration.  It is pertinent to note that the phrase ‘transformative constitutionalism’ has been drawn from post-apartheid legal commentary.
There is a sense in which this Thesis is continuous with my work as an academic economist.  Several strands of White’s work seek to resist economic imperialism, strands that I bring together and extend.  In doing so, an argument is made for re-imagining ‘the economic’ to facilitate a re-imagining of ‘the legal’.",,,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/5029",,,"en",,,"University of Canterbury.

In this context, this thesis aims to discover innovative strategies that might be implemented into German youth justice law. As New Zealand's juvenile justice system, which was established under the Children, Young Persons, and Their Families Act 1989, has become the centre of extensive international attention and has already been adopted and adapted by other jurisdictions, this thesis focuses on the question whether parts of New Zealand's legislation could be transplanted into German youth justice law. For these purposes, the method of Comparative Law is employed. Accordingly, New Zealand's and Germany's social, legal, historical and cultural background are briefly outlined and compared. This comparison reveals that an implementation of concepts of New Zealand law into German law would generally be possible. The historical development of distinct youth justice systems in both countries are presented and differences and similarities are compiled. Both countries' current youth justice legislations are then critically examined. This thesis further provides an evaluation of the practical effectiveness of New Zealand's youth justice system. In this regard, this research is exploratory and qualitative, drawing on semi-structured interviews with 10 practitioners working in the field of youth justice. The comparative and qualitative research identified many strengths as well as some weaknesses of the current youth justice system in New Zealand. Consequently, this thesis comes to the conclusion that an implementation of a youth justice forum comparable to New Zealand's Family Group Conference would be expedient and worthwhile from Germany's perspective, but that some aspects of the New Zealand system like police diversion and the formal court orders, cannot or should not be introduced in Germany. Regarding the latter topic, the comparison of both systems revealed that New Zealand might even be inspired by the German option of imposing youth prison sentences on recidivist offenders.",,,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/851",,,"en",,,"University of Canterbury.

"1926","10092/687",,,"Bortfeld, Mathias",,,,,"2008",,"This thesis focuses on the establishment and operation of the latest regional Human Rights Court: The African Court on Human and Peoples' Rights. For the development of human rights protection mechanisms within regional organizations the governments of the member states are of special relevance. They pull the strings to either foster and develop a system or to disrupt it. Therefore, following a brief historical introduction, the first chapter gives an overview of the regional African organization, the former Organization of African Unity (OAU) and today's African Union (AU) which was instrumental in the establishment of the African Human Rights System and has now enhanced it by adding a judicial authority. However, it will become clear that is has taken a long time for the OAU to put human rights violations within the borders of its own member states on its agenda: Not until there was increasing international pressure due to never-ending excrescences of violence in the dictatorial regimes in Africa did the OAU carefully attend to this matter in the late 1970s. Its efforts culminated in the adoption of the African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights (the eponymous Banjul Charter) which entered into force in 1981. The body for the protection created by the Charter was the African Commission on Human and Peoples' Rights which took up its function in 1987. Since the newly established African Court is not supposed to replace the Commission but rather to strengthen it, the Court operates in concert with the Commission. Therefore the old protection system will still be applicable which deems a portrayal of the system in the following chapter necessary. Here, it will be outlined, that the competences of the Commission remain very limited and that its judicial impact on the State parties involved in its protection procedures has been nearly nil up to this very day. Against this background the next chapter focuses on the Protocol to the Banjul-Charter establishing the African Court on Human and Peoples' Rights. First, the historical-political background and the protocol's juridical formulation process are examined. Here it will be shown that the end of global bipolarity has had a remarkable impact on the political protagonists in Africa with the effect that the increasing demands for a human rights Court within the OAU no longer remained completely unheard. It will also be outlined that the path towards the adoption of the protocol has been long and difficult. After a short survey of the organisational structure of the Court it will become clear that the protocol follows to a large extend its Inter-American counterpart concerning the institutional embodiment. However, a remarkable and, in international comparison, a unique achievement has also been achieved by the institutional regulations by making gender equality has one of the key issues to encompass when it comes to the nomination and election of judges. The following chapters outline the jurisdiction of the Court and the judicial process before the Court. In this connection the admissibility criteria will be highlighted in which two remarkable regulations stand out: First, it will become clear that in contrast to other regional human rights courts individuals and NGOs alike are entitled to file a complaint with the African Court (even though initially with the help of the Commission, since the protocol makes the complaint authority of individuals and NGOs dependent of a special declaration of acceptance of the State Parties concerned). Moreover, also unique compared to international two-tier human rights procedures, the protocol does not include a provision according to which a complainant would be obliged to go through a prior Commission procedure before filing a complaint with the Court. Individual complainants rather have direct access to the Court once a declaration of acceptance has been submitted by a State Party to the protocol. Following short remarks on the competence of the Court to issue provisional measures which, among other things, reveal that these measures have, in contrast to those of the ECtHR, binding effect the procedural termination of a complaint comes into focus. Here, the possible contents of the rulings and the control mechanisms for their implementation are being contemplated in a detailed fashion. This last aspect most probably will have great influence on the fate of the Court since the Commission for its part had to a large extent no success due to the fact that it had no conventional implementation procedures to rely on. Therefore, in the vast majority of cases the findings of the Commission trailed off without any State Party concerned paying any attention to it. The drafters of the protocol establishing the Court obviously have learned this lesson since the protocol provides for a quite remarkable implementation mechanism that may be able to impose political and legal pressure alike on State Parties if the Court deems that they have not properly complied with a Court's ruling. Even sanctions within the African Union against a recusant State come into question from a legal point of view - a quantum leap regarding the legal situation under the Banjul Charter. The last chapter rehearses the main findings of the thesis and concludes with a positive outlook on the future development of the African human rights system.",,,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/1598",,,"en",,,"University of Canterbury.

"2928","10092/687","Webb, Michael Blair",,,,,,,"2001",,"The thesis presents a case study of New Zealand's Alcoholism and Drug Addiction Act 1966 - a civil commitment
law used to detain alcoholics and drug addicts for up to two years in state-certified residential treatment facilities.
The thesis positions itself as a call for legislative reform. The central argument is that the Act is an anachronistic
and potentially draconian piece of social legislation which has no place on the modern-day New Zealand statute book.
In the first part of the thesis, Chapter 1 introduces the research, outlines the structure and methodology of the thesis,
and locates the study within a wider tradition of scholarship on the management of people with alcohol problems.
Chapter 2 summarises the analytical framework that is used to evaluate the Act, attaching particular importance to
both the philosophical traditions and the practical strategies of harm minimisation and therapeutic jurisprudence.
Chapter 3 gives a positivist reading of the legislation : outlining the evolution of the Act, essaying its major provisions,
and noting the efforts that have been made to refine or reform the statute since it was passed in the mid-1960s.
Chapter 4 draws on the limited amount of data available to describe how the Act is currently operating 'on the ground'.
In the second part of the thesis, the Alcoholism and Drug Addiction Act is put into a comparative context by describing
examples of similar-type statutes that exist in two other jurisdictions. Chapter 5 focuses on the New South Wales
Inebriates Act 1912; Chapter 6 focuses on the Swedish Act on Care of Addicts in Certain Cases 1989.
The final part of the thesis builds a case for reform of the Alcoholism and Drug Addiction Act. Chapter 7 identifies
various practical and clinical problems with the Act, which mean that the statute does not work in instrumental terms.
It is submitted that the Act cannot be said to make better provision for the care and treatment of alcoholics.
Chapter 8 highlights several legal and philosophical difficulties with the Act, which mean that the legislation does
not work in value terms. It is submitted that the Act is offensive to the right to refuse treatment and fundamentally
conflicts with the principles of individual autonomy and informed consent. Chapter 9 proposes three options for
reforming the Act, expressing a preference for the outright repeal of the statute. Finally, Chapter 10 draws conclusions
from the preceding discussion, and speculates on the likelihood that the recommended reforms will be implemented.",,,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/2567",,,"en",,,"University of Canterbury.

J.",,,,,"1986",,"In delivering the judgment of the Court of Appeal in Carruthers v Whitaker, (1975), 1 N.Z.L.R. 667, Richmond J expressed the view that when parties in negotiation for the sale and purchase of land instruct solicitors and contemplate the preparation of a formal agreement, the ordinary inference to be drawn is that they intend to contract only by means of the formal document signed by them both.
 The first part of this dissertation represents an attempt to define the bounds of Carruthers v Whitaker by reference to the earlier authorities as they are seen to apply to the situation in which parties who have reached an oral agreement as to terms contemplate the preparation of a formal document. It will be concluded that the Court of Appeal’s decision cannot be regarded as an authority on oral contracts generally: that its ambit is confined to those situations in which there has been no agreement as to the terms contained in the formal document or where execution of the formal document is intended by the parties to operate as a condition precedent to the formation of a concluded contract. Subsequent New Zealand decisions, it is submitted, are seen to support this view. Carruthers v Whitaker, nevertheless, highlights the need for the plaintiff who seeks to rely on an oral contract to show clear evidence that the parties thereto intended to be bound. Moreover, in the light of recent English decisions it will be increasingly difficult to establish that certain non-contractual writings can amount to a sufficient memorandum to satisfy the statutory requirements.
 The latter part of this dissertation is devoted to the authenticated signature fiction, once again within the context of the situation where a formal agreement is contemplated. It will be argue that Sturt v McInnes, (1974) 1 NZLR 729, which is regarded as having established the criteria for the fiction's application in New Zealand, should again be treated as an authority on “written” contracts alone and that to extend its application to post-contract memoranda would be contrary to the earlier authorities within which the doctrine is seen to have emerged.",,,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/7218",,,"en",,,"University of Canterbury.

"3051","10092/687","Barber, Matthew Kelvin",,,,,,,"2008",,"This thesis aims to use general assertions of moral uncertainty as a perspective by which to explore and illuminate contemporary strands of liberal theory. It examines the work of the earlier contemporary liberal theorists, including John Rawls, Robert Nozick, Ronald Dworkin and Bruce Ackerman, as well as the more recent accounts of liberalism that express ideas of pluralism (Michael Walzer, Joseph Raz, John Gray, William Galston, George Crowder), political liberalism (John Rawls, Charles Larmore), public reason (Amy Gutmann & Dennis Thompson, Gerald Gaus), multiculturalism (Charles Taylor, Will Kymlicka, Brian Barry, James Tully, and Bikhu Parekh), and postmodernism (Richard Rorty). The development from the earlier to more recent liberal theories represents a fundamental shift in justificatory strategy: where earlier liberal conceptions aim at universality, and at overcoming or transcending uncertainty, later approaches make this uncertainty, usually in the form of pluralism or difference, central to the liberal project. In order to achieve this, these latter theories tended to presuppose the circumstances of western society, or western democratic values. Generally speaking, these approaches fail to respond adequately to moral uncertainty, and to meet their own justificatory aims. This manifests, in the earlier theories, as plausible but contestable central conceptions, and, in the more recent theories, as the inability to justify particular liberal conceptions in the face of persistence difference. This is an important result, and suggests the need for further developments in liberal justificatory strategies. I suggest that one viable approach would be for liberal theory to accept moral uncertainty, and work from a model of society and self towards a more successful liberal conception.",,,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/2686",,,"en",,,"University of Canterbury.

"3423","10092/687","Heite, Martin",,,,,,,"2008",,"The New Zealand Court of Appeal has recently acknowledged the existence of a freestanding tort of invasion of privacy in Hosking v Runting. The tort is in its infancy and the courts are still grappling with essential problems, the most prominent of which is the conflict with countervailing interests in freedom of speech. In need of guidance, the courts turn to overseas authorities, predominantly from the United Kingdom and the United States of America. The commonly found descriptive nature of the comparison invites a broader analysis of these jurisdictions.
In this thesis, I offer a theoretically informed comparative law analysis of New Zealand's new tort with the American public disclosure of private facts tort and the British extended breach of confidence action. In all three jurisdictions, the conflict of privacy with individual and societal concerns in freedom of speech has led to an exten-sion of (quasi-) constitutional norms derived, for instance, from the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990 into the common law sphere – the horizontal effect. The horizontal application of constitutional rights poses significant legal problems to the common law, because it has learned to deal with duties rather than rights. The time has come to re-consider the nature of rights in both constitutional and tort law. The comparison shows that New Zealand has effectively adopted two torts – one following the duty-based lead of the United States of America and an alternative modelled along the lines of the more rights-orientated British law. The law of the United Kingdom and the USA differ to a degree that calls their comparability into question. I present the preferable British ap-proach as a 'constitutionalised common law tort of privacy.' The results also show that this model represents a competitive third way to traditional solutions based on common law or statute by means of utilising a statutory human rights instrument as an analytical framework for the common law.",,,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/2955",,,"en",,,"University of Canterbury.

"3224","10092/687",,,"Bayley, John Edward",,,,,"2009",,"The majority of established legal systems are predisposed to the express recognition of
good faith in contract. The apparent pressure for harmonisation of contract law arising
from globalisation and political union will necessitate the Anglo-Commonwealth
common law countries addressing their historical resistance to the observance of a
general obligation of good faith. Accordingly this thesis appraises whether there is a
requirement for a universal doctrine of good faith in New Zealand contractual
relationships. The manuscript focuses on a prospective common law doctrine operating
primarily as a rule of construction. It identifies the limits of such a judicial doctrine
including its probable lack of application to non-contractual dealings and the likely need
for a legislative duty if contracting parties are to be precluded from excluding the
obligation. The characteristics of the subject doctrine are explored including the
potential definition and uses of good faith. Whilst it is shown that good faith serves an
important role in contract law, the analysis reveals that there is no current requirement
for an express doctrine within New Zealand. The entrenched ‘piecemeal’ approach
synonymous with Anglo-New Zealand contract law is not demonstrably deficient when
gauged against the reasonable expectations of contracting parties. The current
methodology is preferred to a general, unfamiliar and uncertain good faith principle
which is likely to be reduced to equate with the existing New Zealand law in any event.
Further, duties consonant with good faith may enhance economic efficiency but not in
some instances. Good faith is therefore best imposed in specific circumstances rather
than as a universal doctrine. Likewise, there is insufficient evidence to suggest that New
Zealand is impaired in the international arena due to a lack of good faith despite
pressure for New Zealand to accord with widespread overseas practice. The principle is
of minimal utility in international trade where commercial certitude is paramount.
Although an imperfect exemplar, the unresolved issues pertaining to contractual good
faith in domestic American law confirms the identified reservations associated with the
subject doctrine.",,,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/2862",,,"en",,,"University of Canterbury.

"4158","10092/687",,,"McCoy, Gerard John Xavier",,,,,"2007",,"This thesis investigates three exemplars of uxorial substantive privileges in the criminal law: the marital coercion doctrine, the intraspousal conspiracy exemption, and the uxorial post-offence accessorial immunity. Their history, choreography and variations are comparatively investigated across the common law jurisdictions including the impact of statutory interventions. The principal argument is that the judicial and legislative treatment of these uxorial privileges has been inconsistent or erratic so that they are not the products of any systematic, modern development in the criminal law. This thesis proposes that there is no justification for their continued retention in common law legal systems. Archival, Parliamentary, and other sources have been used to identify the factors impinging upon the creation of specific statutory uxorial privileges. The diaspora of these laws throughout the other common law jurisdictions is investigated. The discussion is illustrated by examination of the particular issues raised by polygamy, customary law concubinage as well as by gender-reassignment. This thesis examines whether both gender-specific and marriage-specific criteria are valid constituents within the parameters of substantive criminal law. It traces the genesis of these special defences within the criminal law available exclusively to women, from the time of King Ine of the West Saxons c712, to examine the current status of such laws throughout common law jurisdictions. The investigation explores factors shaping the creation of a statutory defence of marital coercion by the British Parliament in 1925 and outlines the challenges generated by that law and its extraordinary resilience. This thesis demonstrates the failure of the criminal law to provide an overarching construct to implement emergent gender equality.",,,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/3674",,,"en",,,"University of Canterbury.

The paper specifically questions whether current substantive and procedural requirements for redundancy, as construed by the Courts, are in keeping with the intentions underpinning the Employment Relations Act 2000 (ERA), in particular, whether they fit with the principle of good faith and whether they provide an equal balance between the rights of the employer and the rights of the employees.  It focuses on the common law that has developed around redundancy issues largely under the personal grievance regime.  

In order to consider accurately these issues, the paper initially outlines the history of redundancy law, key legislative concepts and the New Zealand environment.  Following this, discussion on both the procedural and substantive elements of redundancy law is outlined. It is through this analysis that symptomatic issues within each aspect of the current law are addressed and appropriately explored.  Finally, new governmental and legislative developments are discussed prior to a broad conclusion being established.  This addresses the key questions outlined above, as well as the supplementary issues identified within this paper. The conclusion advocates that redundancy law in New Zealand is in need of change and that the best method to achieve this is through legislation.",,,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/5506",,,"en",,,"University of Canterbury.

"4713","10092/687","Diaz, Julio Alberto",,,,,,,"2010",,"The interest of jurists in legal systems other than their own has been a matter of long
tradition. All legal systems have the same purpose of regulating and harmonizing the human
activity within their respective societies, and in each society the legal system forms part of
the culture and civilization as well as of the history and the life of its people. Many legal
problems are conceptually the same wherever they arise. Jurists from different systems
confront the same problems. Sometimes codes and case law give the same answer, sometimes
those answers are different; if this was the case, I wanted to explore whether some answers
were better than others.
It would certainly not be accurate to say that there has been no approximation between
the civil law and the common law traditions. Arguments that these two systems are drawing
progressively closer can be heard more and more often. In spite of having started from
opposite extremes, it is said that as a result of the movements the civil law and the common
law have made in the direction of the other, there is no longer much difference between them.
The same social needs, and similar economic and technical conditions, have led to the
adoption of similar solutions for their legal problems. However, even admitting as a fact that
the results might be close to each other, the methods used to reach them are nevertheless
extremely divergent. After all, the ‘idioms of legal thought’ and the guiding habits of mind
are different. A civilian naturally reasons from principles to instances, the common lawyer
from instances to principles. The civilian puts his faith in syllogisms, the common lawyer in
precedents; the first silently asking himself as each new problem arises, ‘What should we do
this time?’ and the second asking aloud in the same situation, ‘What did we do last time?’
The civilian thinks in terms of rights and duties, the common lawyer in terms of remedies.
The civilian is chiefly concerned with the policy and rationale of a rule of law, the common
lawyer with its pedigree. The instinct of a civilian is to systematize, the working rule of the
common lawyer is solvitur ambulando.1
By the end of the nineteenth century, Oliver Wendell Holmes was telling Americans
not to study civil law because ‘it tends to encourage a dangerous reliance…on glittering
generalities’ instead of ‘the exhaustive analysis of a particular case which the common law
begins and ends.’2 It has not always been so. At the beginning of the same century, new

translations appeared of Grotius, Puffendorf, Pothier and Domat.3 Courts and treatise writers
used them. An English judge praised Pothier as the highest authority one could cite next to an
English case.4 A New York court consulted Grotius, Puffendorf and Barbeyrac to decide who
owned a fox caught on Long Island, a decision that still appears in many American
casebooks.5
At no point does this thesis have the purpose of pretending to demonstrate the cultural
superiority of one system over the other. Each system possesses strong characteristic of a
distinct and comprehensive nature that establishes its own individuality. In its own ethnic and
historical framework, each system serves well the society in which it functions; each has
demonstrated its ability to satisfy the social and economic needs of a world in constant
change. Each has also maintained a balance between the elements of flexibility and
adaptation, on the one hand, while assuring the essential attributes of stability and security,
on the other. I assumed from the beginning that comparative law is much more than a set of
different legal rules. It has a historical, political, social and cultural dimension. The law is
rooted in the culture, it reflects the Volksgeist (the spirit of the People) and it responds to the
specific demands of a given society in a given time and place. Substitution of one legal
tradition for another would neither be possible nor desirable.
At the start of this research, a shocking contrast between styles revealed that the
difficulties were going to be huge. To a civilian lawyer who was having his first contact with
the common law, it looked as if I had in front of my eyes a gigantic, disorganized, amorphous
mass of cases. It was not until later, that I learned that the same feeling existed among
common law lawyers. It was not a civilian, but Bernard Rudden who wryly observed that ‘the
alphabet is virtually the only instrument of intellectual order of which the common law makes
use.’6 In particular, in relation to torts, it has been submitted that the fundamental reason for
this is that, unlike the law of property or the law of contract, both of which (at least in part)
have to formulate guidelines within which individuals can arrange their affairs, the law of
torts always has to respond retrospectively to alleged wrongdoings.7 In any event, the fact is
that it was clear from the beginning that the lack of normative coherence and consistency that
a code provides (and to which I was used to) was going to represent for me a permanent
source of disorientation.

Early doubts started to emerge: would it really be possible to compare an abstract
system of thought divorced from particular sets of facts, as the civil law is, to a bunch of
inductive ideas capable of functioning only within limited factual spheres? Was it really
going to be possible to compare a system capable of transcending disputes by moving away
from factual immediacies to a technique of dispute resolutions?
Warning about the difficulties of comparative law, one of the greatest English
comparatists, Professor Frederick Lawson, remarked how hard it is to comprehend the main
subjects of just a single system of private law. He certainly was well aware of the enormous
background that lies behind a comparative work and, most of all, the Herculean effort that it
takes to anyone who has the courage or naivety to venture into the dense and trackless forest
of a second system. Just as an experienced traveller contemplating a long and dangerous road
that is as likely as not to take him to the right destination might reasonably refuse to leave
home, the prospective obstacles of the comparison of the laws of different families are in
such a big number and of such scaring dimension, that wisdom would advise to give up
before even starting. At the same time, and perhaps for the same reasons, the challenge
represented an irresistible temptation. It has been said that to learn another system of law is
like learning another language and just as a person who is bilingual is much better able to
appreciate the merits of the languages he speaks, the contrast between two systems, so
different in their genius and their genesis like the common and the civil law, can certainly
provide a much richer range of model solutions than they could possibly do on their own.
Although initially my intention was not to describe any specific national jurisdiction,
but simply to contrast a set of prevailing attitudes, tendencies or currents of thoughts towards
liability for non physical damage in the two main legal systems, soon this approach started to
show its impracticability. Despite the strong forces tending to produce uniformity within each
system, diversity exists and, on many occasions, the precise legal rules in force of particular
jurisdictions differed so widely that it would be inaccurate to keep the assumption of
monolithic, unified or homogeneous viewpoints and some necessary references to specific
jurisdictions (in both systems) were finally made. Because of the major contribution that
France and Germany have made to the civil law tradition and the intellectual leadership that
both occupy in the civil law world, most of the time I have chosen those models as a
representative, although partial expression, of the civil law perspective to each of the issues
that were under scrutiny. In the common law, England, Australia, Canada and New Zealand
are often subject of my attention.
The notion of ‘non physical damage’ as a unifying concept would probably not mean
too much to a common law lawyer. By the same token, psychiatric harm and economic loss
as particular types of damage with different applying rules would make many civilians to
raise eyebrows in disbelief (or disdain). In the common law, the rules relating to the negligent
infliction of non physical harm did not develop alongside the principles governing the
negligent infliction of physical damage. The significant consequence of this peculiarity is that
the nature of the injury suffered becomes a very important factor in determining the
protective scope of the duty of care. To single out psychiatric harm and economic loss as selfcontained
categories represent an immediate need for creating special control factors, and this
appears to be intrinsically associated with arbitrary and anomalous results. These two
perplexing and difficult areas of the law seem in amazing contrast with the intriguing
simplicity of the French system which approaches cases of non physical damage applying the
same criteria as to any other tort claim.
In the first chapter, I analyze the law relating to the recovery of damages for
psychiatric harm. I start the research in the common law where it unquestionably represents a
very complex area of the law without apparent coherent background principles. In the second
part, the research compares and contrasts the different (in some cases considerably different)
approaches of several civil law jurisdictions with particular emphasis on French and German
law.
In the second chapter, I examine the recoverability of economic loss. Out of its
infinite variety of factual situations, I have chosen as a starting point for the analysis and
discussion three of the main categories: misstatements, relational economic loss, and
defective products or building structures. Following the same pattern as in the previous
chapter, I discuss in the first place the approach taken in the common law, where the levels of
complexity seem to be much higher.
Finally, the third chapter is reserved for the conclusions, stressing in particular the
undeniable artificiality of the category, the excessive role attributed to policy and the relevant
place that should be reserved for morality in the law of torts.
In retrospect, to choose non physical damage as the theme of my thesis was probably
unwise for someone with no experience in the common law. Neither psychiatric damage nor
economic loss has arrived at any fixed form; everything is highly ambivalent. The puzzles
and anomalies that constantly surround them are certainly greater than in any other area of
the law and they represented a permanent reminder of my lack of wisdom. Both psychiatric
damage and economic loss are complex, vast and multifaceted issues. Both are of universal
scope. They count among those topics which universally create difficulties transcending the
idiosyncratic formal-conceptual foundations of the various local systems. Both are placed at
the very heart of tort liability and raise the most fundamental questions about the boundaries
and frontiers of liability and private litigation. Be that as it may, I accepted the challenge.
Whether I have succeeded or not is not for me to decide. However, what I would like to
reinforce is that this is the look of a civilian, not a common law lawyer, and this naturally
reflects, not only on the conclusions but also in the method, systematization, and even the
style of analysing cases and over viewing of principles. For that, I ask the sympathy of the
reader.",,,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/4177",,,"en",,,"University of Canterbury.

"5393","10092/687","Beck, Linda",,,,,,,"2010",,"The passage of the Employment Contracts Act by the National government in 1991 caused considerable controversy amongst trade unions in New Zealand and legal practitioners. I decided to examine whether the government had met its stated intentions to create a straight-forward, cheap, and accessible system for resolving personal grievances. Therefore the main questions to be asked related to what people’s experiences were using adjudication under the Act, and whether the system adequately resolved personal grievance issues. In particular, I focused on the experiences of participants using the personal grievance adjudication procedure. The question of whether the process actually worked for participants could be measured by examining available access to the system in terms of cost and accessibility of representation. Another factor to be considered related to whether ultimate conclusions reached by the employment tribunal adequately addressed the issues raised. For example – did grievance receive adequate compensation? What were the costs involved to the parties and did the grievant have suitable employment? This research investigated whether the personal grievance adjudication system work in the manner intended by the government of the day for those participants.
Interviews with employment tribunal adjudicators were a crucial art of determining whether or not the adjudication process worked successfully. Adjudicators were very open and willing to participate, and a considerable amount of unexpected, useful information was forthcoming. Surveys of participants in 150 personal grievances which occurred in 1997 supported the information provided by adjudicators. Data obtained from researching all personal grievance and cost decisions in 1997 provided
xv
quantitative support to the comments made by adjudicators, and those received by survey participants.
The wide range of research methodologies used in conducting this thesis gives some credence to the conclusions reached as the range of processes used covered many different aspects of the adjudication system and how it affected participants in an unprecedented manor. The research conducted by Ian McAndrew in Otago covered the entire period during which the Employment Contracts Act 1991 was enforced. However, the questions asked in this thesis have tended to be more specific.
In summary, my research has suggested that whether or not the Employment Contracts Act 1991 adjudication system worked largely depended on circumstances of each individual participant. Members of the legal profession felt most at home using adjudication, whilst many applicants and some respondents felt varying degrees of trepidation. Likewise, the views of adjudicators regarding the success of the system often depended on their background and experience.",,,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/4981",,,"en",,,"University of Canterbury.

"5538","10092/687","Phillips, Andrew Paul",,,,,,,"2010",,"Globally, invasive non-native species introduced by human vectors are one of the main drivers of biodiversity loss and the damage to the functioning of global ecosystems is arguably irreversible. Antarctica is the only continent to remain relatively unaffected but the warming climate and changing patterns of human use are eroding the natural biogeographical and climactic barriers that have isolated Antarctic species and ecosystems in their natural evolution.  
Biosecurity is the exclusion, eradication or effective management of risks posed by NNS to the environment and broad obligations exist at the global level to engage in biosecurity measures to protect biological diversity. Although the issue has been significant attention in the context of the Antarctic Treaty System, including a permit based regulatory system for the intentional introduction of non-native species, there is no clear strategic focus on mitigating against unintentional introductions. Moreover, as only half of the tourist and fisheries operators are flagged to States outside the ATS, significant risks remain outside the ambit of the regional management organisation. The thesis evaluates the extent regional and international legal regulations address non-native species issues in the Antarctic through a vector based approach that focuses on the three main pathways of potential introduction; National Antarctic programs, tourist operators and fishing vessels. 
The research shows there are gaps and inconsistencies in all the levels of response and a lack of strategic planning mechanisms and compliance processes that limit the individual efforts of States to address the issue. The obligations found in the Antarctic Treaty System create specific obligations to take into account the indirect environmental effects of Antarctic activity and addressing non-native species has been prioritised within some of the relevant institutions but there remain systematic issues that cannot be resolved without fundamentally altering the environmental management of the area. 
The thesis proposes the development of a strategic biosecurity response within the Antarctic Treaty System that integrates the lessons learned at the domestic and global level. Although developing a unitary framework should be a priority, States should work incrementally to develop mechanisms based on risk assessment and analysis with an end goal of binding measures under the Antarctic Treaty System. An institution that binds the disparate approaches of States operating in the area with a mandate to strategically integrate comprehensive preventative, surveillance and response measures into Antarctic and relevant international management processes is essential. More fundamentally the thesis argues that strategic area based planning, reporting and inspection processes are necessary to address the cumulative impacts of Antarctic actor’s activities and ensure all actors within the Antarctic area comply with biosecurity objectives.",,,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/5349",,,"en",,,"University of Canterbury.

"2641","10092/687","Janssen, Gerard",,,,,,,"2008",,"The primary objectives of this thesis were: to explore potential delivery pathways of supportive molecules to teleost musculature, and combined with perfusion visualisation experiments, to generate a greater understanding of teleost white muscle perfusion.  A Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) perfused isolated tail preparation was assessed as a delivery platform with limited results as perfusion to the white muscle did not replicate that in the live fish.  A direct uptake delivery method, where hydrophobic molecules diffuse across the gill lamellae and accumulate in the blood and white muscle, was assessed with the aquatic anaesthetic isoeugenol (AQUI-STM).  Snapper (Pagrus auratus) exposed to low (4.5±0.3 mg.L-1), medium (8.6±0.1 mg.L-1) and high (14.0±0.3 mg.L-1) isoeugenol concentrations had maximum plasma isoeugenol concentrations of 10.5, 5.8 and 4.9 times (low, medium and high)  and white muscle concentrations 9.7, 4.6 and 1.9 times (respectively) the exposure concentration.  Direct uptake delivery, compared with the perfused tail preparation, was a relatively non-invasive and non-technical method of delivery that has potential for large scale commercial application.  The curcuminoids, which are strong antioxidants derived from the spice turmeric, were also shown to rapidly diffuse into the plasma and musculature of snapper.  There were no short term benefits on white muscle metabolic rundown in fish treated with curcumnoids compared to a non-treated control.  However, a short term accelerated storage trial suggested that snapper treated with curcuminoids showed reduced lipid peroxidation.  The successful delivery of supportive molecules to the white muscle is dependent on perfusion.  There is very little research on white muscle perfusion and how it is affected by changing environmental parameters.  Cardiac performance and white muscle perfusion and haemoglobin saturation were recorded from anaesthetised snapper during acute progressive hypoxia and hypothermia (and recovery) in real time, using fibre optics.  White muscle perfusion, as assessed by haemoglobin concentration, decreased during hypoxia and hypothermia.  The intrinsic control of cardiac function and white muscle perfusion in an anaesthetised fish, and the adaptive significance of reduced white muscle perfusion during hypoxia and hypothermia are discussed.",,,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/4417",,,"en",,,"University of Canterbury.

"7792","10092/687",,,"Mulholland, R. D.",,,,,"1984",,"What is now referred to as the Ramsden v Dyson principle began life as nothing more than a bundle of instances in which equity would assert jurisdiction.
 It experienced a period of systematisation in the later years of last century when attempts were made to encumber it with a series of rules.
 In the middle years of the present century, with Lord Denning taking the lead, the Ramsden v Dyson principle quickly shed these rules and took on the wider function of providing the courts with a weapon whereby non contractual expectations may be fulfilled, or otherwise protected.
 The basis upon which the courts determine whether the expectation will be fulfilled is whether or not it would be unconscionable to the representee to allow the expectation to remain unfulfilled. This will normally involve some degree of detriment to the representee if the representor is permitted to resile from the expectation which he has raised in the mind of the representee.
 Thus in order to succeed in invoking the Ramsden v Dyson principle the representee has to show the existence of two basic requirements. Firstly, that the other party, the representor that is, has raised an expectation which would be such to influence a reasonable man. Secondly that it would be unconscionable for the expectation not to be fulfilled.
 The present state of the law allows virtually a complete discretion to the courts as to when they will assert jurisdiction and as to the remedy which will be decreed. The remedy is not limited to a simple specific performance of the expectation.
 The basis of the Ramsden v Dyson principle is barely distinguishable from that underlying other heads of estoppel such as the High Trees principle and the Dillwyn v Llewelyn principle.
 With the departure of Lord Denning M.R. from the judicial scene a degree of momentum has apparently been removed from the development of the principle and there have been signs in some recent cases of attempts to limit the further development of the principle.
 The method of investigation has been by orthodox case analysis with the division of the work following from the judicial decisions.",,,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/7219",,,"en",,,"University of Canterbury.

"7786","10092/687",,,"Black, J. H.",,,,,"1992",,"Despite popular perception, the law in relation to ""cheques in full and final satisfaction"" is not a separate branch of the law of contract. The law pertaining to cheques in full and final satisfaction is simply an application of the common law principles of accord and satisfaction. It is perhaps for this very reason that prior to the landmark High Court decision in Homeguard Products (NZ) Limited v Kiwi Packaging Limited there were very few New Zealand decisions concerning the same.
 The factual situation which gives rise to such a scenario is relatively straightforward. A simple illustration would be that of a building contract, where the builder had been instructed to, and had built a house for another party to occupy. A dispute may then have arisen as to the quality of the workmanship, the owner asserting that a defective job had been done. The owner may then tender a cheque to the builder for a lesser sum than was due under the contract, asserting that the same is proffered in full and final settlement of the dispute. This letter and cheque may arrive in the mail and be opened by a clerk employed by the builder, who has authority to bank cheques but no authority to settle claims. This clerk may then without noting the terms of the letter, detach and bank the cheque. Several days later this letter may then come to the attention of the builder, who then writes back to the owner expressly stating that he does not accept that he has received the cheque in full and final satisfaction, has banked it on account, and will be pursuing the owner for the balance.
 On this scenario, if the proposition of Mahon J. in the case of Homeguard is correct, then upon the clerk employed by the builder banking the cheque tendered in full and final satisfaction an accord and satisfaction would have resulted, and despite the builder's protests to the contrary, he would be unable to sue for the balance he felt due to him under the previous contract. 
 As the existing case law stands there is an onus on the creditor if he banks the cheque to inform the debtor that his payment in full condition is rejected. Some cases state this must be done at the time, others suggest that days is too late, and generally uncertainty reigns as to when a creditor will be taken to be bound by the debtor's payment in full offer.",,,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/7213",,,"en",,,"University of Canterbury.

"7787","10092/687",,,"Cadenhead, A. J.",,,,,"1985",,"Specific performance while being but one of numerous equitable remedies is a broad and many sided equitable doctrine. The nature of this paper does not allow an exhaustive examination of specific performance. Instead one is seeking to peruse selected aspects of specific performance. Hence damages and a cross section of equitable discretionary defences to performance have been selected. Such discretionary defences form various loose classes and several defences have been selected from each class. For example under the class of ""Traditional defences"" the paper considers (a) Mutuality and (b) Impossibility; whereas other traditional defences such as Laches and Acquiescence are left unconsidered. Moreover, ""fairness"", ""hardship"" and ""clean hands"" are investigated from the category of purely equitable defences. Further a hybrid class of defence is explored, which while being relevant from an equitable point of view, also may vitiate the entire contract at common law. Such class incorporates inter alia Mistake, Misrepresentation and Illegality.
 Finally performance with regard to testamentary dispositions and the place of third parties in relation to performance are viewed as a special class.
 In researching the aspects of specific performance including the history of the remedy, the fact that this area of equity was undergoing a restructuring became evident. Was performance specific performance altering to keep apace with changing commercial and social attitudes - equity being based squarely on morals and conscience both parameters being measured in terms of the accepted standards of society as a whole?
 Do the recent spate of statutes which prima facia attempt to codify the common-law of contract enlarge the discretion to refuse specific performance?
 This paper looks towards a re-emergence of the concept of conscience, the basis of all matters equitable, a concept that has been swathed in case law for at least a century. Hence Fry's major work on specific performance, is considered sparingly given its publication date of 1926. Further Spry's Third Edition of ""Equitable Remedies"" (1984) came to hand at a time which allowed only for brief reference to the same in footnotes.
 It should be kept in mind when considering the New Zealand case law on specific performance as opposed to, say the English, that the New Zealand High Court is asked to be both the strict common lawyer and yet still be able to have regard to the length of the chancellors foot - the latter measurement holding sway in instances of conflict. It is ventured that this dual task causes principles, particularly in the damages field, to become confused.

"7788","10092/687",,,"Conte, Alex",,,,,"2005",,"In the wake of the September 11 attacks, it must be confessed that I was quite overwhelmed by the horrific events, by the loss of life, and by the sheer visual impact and magnitude of the attacks against the World Trade Centre and Pentagon. Overwhelmed but at the same time eager, not in any morbid sense, to learn more about terrorism. September 11 also created significant media and public interest. Having entered academia a year earlier, after some years in private practice, and as the only international lawyer at the University of Canterbury, I responded by writing on the subject. Soon enough, that research and writing led to this thesis.
 As a full-time lecturer at the University of Canterbury, a part-time Barrister of the High Court of New Zealand, and a part-time PhD candidate, the progress and methodology in the writing of this thesis has been somewhat haphazard at times. The first two years of research were perhaps not typical of postgraduate research. That period of time was characterised by three types of activity: the collation of materials, from treaties to articles and cases; the writing of papers and articles on particular issues involved within the thesis topic; and the presentation of papers or other oral discussions and debate, including the giving of evidence to the Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Committee on the Counter-Terrorism Bill 2002.
 In July 2004 I was fortunate enough to take up a research fellowship at the Centre for International and Public Law at the Australian National University, working with those involved in the Australian Research Council funded project on Terrorism and the Non-State Actor. With that work, this period was an opportunity to almost entirely dedicate time to the writing of the thesis proper. That period saw the further development of a number of ideas and the writing of four significant chapters and the near completion of a fifth chapter. Since returning to New Zealand from the fellowship in early December 2004, the preponderance of my time was again devoted to the writing and completion of the thesis. Thus it might be said that a little over two years of research was sporadic and characterised by the research and consideration of isolated issues, while the balance of time consisted of a much more concentrated period of writing and review.
 When first embarking upon this research, I was warned by colleagues that this would be akin to running a marathon, and it certainly has felt so at times. However, although the run has been a solo one, there are many I am grateful to for their roadside support. To my mother, for her unfailing faith, encouragement and pride. To my supervisors, Professor Chris Joyner at the Department of Government, Georgetown University, Washington DC, and Professors John Burrows and Scott Davidson at the School of Law, University of Canterbury, New Zealand. Professor Burrows' quiet, thoughtful, honest and generous oversight has meant a great deal to me, as did the generous input of Professor Davidson. I must likewise thank my colleagues, particularly those of the International Law Group at the University of Canterbury and the Centre for International and Public Law at the Australian National University, especially Dr Neil Boister, Professor Andrew Byrnes, John Caldwell, Associated Professor Pene Matthew, and Barbara von Tigerstrom.",,,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/7215",,,"en",,,"University of Canterbury.

"11369","10092/687","Powell, Rhonda",,,,,,,"2014",,"Suicide is the leading ‘external’ (non-natural) cause of death in Australia.
Australian coronial courts play a critical role in reporting suicide deaths. Coronial
findings contribute to the data used by the Australian Bureau of Statistics to compile
mortality statistics, which underpin suicide prevention strategies and their evaluation.
The public interest requires that coroners report suicide when it occurs so as to allow
accurate statistics about the incidence of suicide to be collated, to promote efficient
suicide prevention strategies and enable suicide prevention objectives to be achieved.
It is widely recognised that suicide is underreported.
The Coronial Council of Victoria (Council), whose membership includes medical and
legal professionals as well as community and police representatives, has investigated
problems with suicide reporting in the Victorian coronial jurisdiction. The Council
aims to promote change within the Victorian coronial jurisdiction with a view to
parallel changes being implemented throughout Australia.
The key problem identified by the Council is that inconsistencies in coronial
practices hinder the accurate collection of suicide data. Too often, when the deceased
took an action that caused their death, the circumstances of death are described
generally but an explicit finding is not made about whether or not the deceased
intended to end their life.
The Council has formed the view that there is a need for a legislative requirement that
coroners make a clear finding about the intention of people whose actions cause their
own death, where the evidence permits. There are a number of circumstances that
may apply to such deaths, including accident and suicide.
In some cases, the deceased may not have had the capacity to understand the effects
of their actions or there may be insufficient evidence for the coroner to come to a
conclusion about the deceased’s intent. In these cases, it would be useful for suicide
prevention activities for the coroner to identify whether death was a reasonably
foreseeable consequence of the deceased’s action.
The primary recommendations of the Council are that the Attorney-General:
1. propose amendment to the Coroners Act 2008 (Vic) to require that coroners make
a finding of intention, as supported by the evidence, in relation to all investigated
deaths found to be caused by an action of the deceased; and
2. raise the issue of standardisation of coronial legislation and/or coronial systems in
Australia in the Standing Council on Law, Crime and Community Safety and
propose that changes be implemented in parallel in all Australian jurisdictions.
The Council’s recommendations are set out in further detail at the end of the report.",,,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/10117",,,"en",,,"University of Canterbury.

"7790","10092/687",,,"Finn, Jeremy Nigel",,,,,"1995",,"The thesis considers various of the factors which shaped the development of the statute law of the British settlement colonies in the nineteenth century. The principal argument is that the conventional analysis which largely ascribes legal development in each colony to either British precedents or indigenous innovations and regards the influence of other colonies as of only occasional importance is inadequate and must be modified. The thesis proposes instead an analysis which recognises borrowing from other colonies as a standard means of legal development and reform. Archival, parliamentary and other sources are used to assess the factors influencing legal developments found in several colonies. The thesis examines some of the elements which influenced the choices made by colonial legislators or legislatures in the selection of colonial or English statutes as the basis for further colonial legislation. The discussion is illustrated by examination of particular areas of law and by a reference to the degree to which statute law was the product of the influence of certain individuals and institutions. In particular there is discussion of the role of the members of the judiciary and of other colonial officials, particularly the Parliamentary Draftsmen employed in some colonies in the latter part of the period, as well as consideration of the nature and impact of legislation put forward by private members of the legislative bodies. The role and effect of the Colonial Office in monitoring and developing colonial law is also discussed. The thesis also seeks to explore the formal and informal channels by which legal ideas and innovations passed from colony to colony, particularly the developments which were generated by the migration of individuals between colonies or which relied, in whole or in part, on unofficial links between government officials, lawyers, politicians or other individuals in the different colonies.",,,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/7217",,,"en",,,"University of Canterbury.

Henry Chapman served as judge in Wellington (1844-1852) and Dunedin (1864-1875) and was also a barrister, law lecturer and acting judge in Victoria (1854-1864). Frederick Chapman was a member of the Dunedin bar (1872-1903), President of the New Zealand Court of Arbitration (1903-1907), and judge of the New Zealand Supreme Court and Court of Appeal (1903-1924). Besides examining their legal careers, I outline their personal and educational backgrounds and their wide range of extra-legal activities. I study each man's career in chronological order, with convenient subdivisions relating mainly to their shifting geographical locations. In an appendix I sketch the career of Martin Chapman, whose life was intertwined with those of his father Henry and brother Frederick and therefore forms a useful reference-point for the thesis. The structure of my study is determined by my conviction that, as far as possible, one must allow historical material to suggest its own significance and not try to shape it according to conscious predetermined convictions.
 This thesis is of human interest in itself. The combination of a rare collection of family papers, official records and published accounts produces a detailed and intimate account of the lives of Henry and Frederick Chapman and of their periods. The thesis also sheds light on the characteristics and values of the educated, aspirant middle class to which the Chapmans belonged. These included a strong commitment to the work ethic, an emphasis on self-improvement in a wide range of areas, a benevolent tolerance, and a devotion to family life. Finally, the thesis illuminates important aspects of colonial legal development in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, and in particular the continued strength of inherited English legal traditions counterbalanced by the steady growth of a unique New Zealand jurisprudence.",,,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/7633",,,"en",,,"University of Canterbury.

"16024","10092/839",,"Brown, Olivia R.",,,,,,"2016",,"On 3 September 2015, the Volkswagen emissions scandal was dramatically drawn to the public’s attention when the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) discovered the company was intentionally installing ‘defeat’ software to misrepresent its diesel cars’ exhaust emission levels. The scandal resulted in a global recall of hundreds of thousands of cars, billions of dollars in fines and a loss of reputation for the company.
This research adopted an interpretive perspective and a social constructionist ontological position to explore how public print media together with the company constructed the emissions scandal. To do this, I applied a framing analysis that involved examining newspaper articles from seven countries and the company’s website articles over 12 months, from the scandal’s discovery in September 2015 until the settlement of lawsuits in September 2016.
Seventy one company website communications from Volkswagen and 751 newspaper articles from The Guardian, The New York Times, The Sydney Morning Herald, China Daily, The Times of India, O GLOBO and Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung were collected. These represent the most influential of the digitally accessible newspapers in Volkswagen’s seven most important international car markets. The analysis involved two phases: First, the articles were subjected to a preliminary analysis using Leximancer and NVivo software to identify potential frames that could arise in the framing analysis. Secondly, a framing analysis was applied to those articles to identify dominant frames, recognise recurring patterns, and identify the similarities and differences between the newspapers and the company’s communications.
There were five key findings. First, 10 dominant frames occurred in both the global and local reporting. Secondly, of these the frames, the company accountability, individual accountability, investigative, scandal, and solution frames appeared consistently. Thirdly, these emerged at the same point on the scandal’s timeline which points to the frames being used to show the story’s progression and to respond to events. Fourthly, the cooperation, future, accepting accountability, redemption, solution and staff restructuring frames constantly appeared in the company’s online communications. Fifthly, together these findings revealed that the print media and Volkswagen operated in parallel worlds characterised by a complete lack of ideational engagement.
This research represents the first study to compare the framing of the Volkswagen emissions scandal in public print media with the company’s communications, both across countries and over time. The findings from this study reinforce the value of employing framing analysis to understand the degree of collaboration between media and a corporate across a developing corporate risk, providing valuable insights into the degree to which the media and company communications are synchronised during a scandal as well as filling a gap in the current literature on the Volkswagen emissions scandal.",,,,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/13340",,"en","English",,"University of Canterbury",,,,,"http://library.canterbury.ac.nz/thesis/etheses_copyright.shtml",,"All Rights Reserved",,,,,,,,,,,"Corporate scandal or industry corruption? how the VW emissions crisis was framed in public print media and company communication",,,"Electronic Thesis or Dissertation",,"Business Administration",,,"University of Canterbury",,"Masters",,,"Master of Commerce",,"2469604",,,"College of Business and Law, University of Canterbury",,,"olivia_rb@hotmail.com",,,,,,,,"Dr Colleen Mills"
"16025","10092/839",,"Zhao, Xiaoli",,,,,,"2016",,"A review of the extensive international business collaboration (IBC) literature reveals scholars’ predisposition to focus on either knowledge or resources at the company level. Very little research has been conducted at the level of the key internal stakeholders within the collaborating companies that form international business alliances, commonly termed international joint ventures (IJVs). The result is that we know very little about the lived-in reality of these stakeholders who create an IJV and even less about the sense they make of their own strategy practice (SP, also called strategy-as-practice, SaP) and that of the key stakeholders in their partner company.
My study sought to address these shortcomings in the literature by undertaking a qualitative, exploratory case study to uncover how key internal stakeholders in two companies collaborating in a Sino-New Zealand international joint venture (IJV) collaboration made sense of their own and the other company’s strategic actions during the development of their IJV. My study posed the following questions:
 How do key internal stakeholders in a particular Sino-NZ context make sense of and give sense to strategic actions related to the development and maintenance of an international business collaboration?
 How does this sensemaking and/or sensegiving influence international business collaboration in this case?
To answer these research questions an inductive interpretive approach was adopted and three stages of interlinked data collection and analysis were conducted. Data were collected from company documents, semi-structured interviews, and limited participant observation. Interpretive analysis was performed using NVivo (10) software. In the stage 1 analysis, 39 documents and 7 interviews were used to construct two composite narratives of IJV collaboration (one for each company). In the stage 2 analysis, 16 meetings and 30 interviews were used to compare SP and practices of the two companies. The insights gained triggered the search for complementary theoretical concepts and contributed to development of the conceptual models produced in stage 3. The stage 3 analysis sought to conceptualise the disjunction in the ways the two companies made sense of the strategy practices revealed in their composite narratives and resulted in two theoretical models based on the analysis of data from 15 interviews and the Stage 1 and 2 data: a model conceptualising the sensemaking discrepancies between the partner companies in the IJV collaboration and a model of the sensemaking about performance in the IJV collaboration.
These two models are the primary contributions of this study. The first model explicates 11 interrelated aspects that the analysis suggested were responsible for a sensemaking discrepancy (SMD) in the IJV collaboration. These were sensemaking about learning, sensemaking about experience, sensemaking about strategising, barriers to communication, habitus, cultural values, business practices, work environment, expectations, emotions, and beliefs. The second model conceptualises the flow of sensemaking actions that were found to constitute the complex context of the IJV collaboration and explained the participants’ sensemaking about their own and others’ performance as they maintained and developed the IJV collaboration over time.
Two new concepts were created as part of the development of these models: A sensemaking discrepancy (SMD) embedded in the IJV relationship that disrupts or challenges collaboration and collaboration focused interaction (CFI) (or lack of it) which is proposed as the underlying mechanism influencing discrepancies in sensemaking about performance in an IJV collaboration.
In addition to the conceptual models and the two new concepts embedded in them, three significant observations emerged from the case study. First, the collective narratives for each partner company showed that at the company level strategic practices were aligned with the key stakeholders’ fundamentally different views of the partnership relationship. This is not surprising as the key stakeholders in both companies were reticent about engaging with each other once the IJV was in place, suggesting that these individuals felt challenged by the prospect of confronting frustrations caused by their fundamentally different views of the IJV relationship.
Second, a comparison of each company’s collective narrative suggested the two companies developed strategy practices to ameliorate the tensions caused by their different ways of doing business, rather than confronting these tensions. These practices then led to dissatisfaction with each other’s performance in the IJV and prompted a change in the shareholding structure.
Third, sensemaking itself could be a strategic action when it occurred in situations where there was misalignment of values, business practices and habitus between the IJV partners. It was found that a sensemaking discrepancy (SMD) was embedded in the IJV relationship and disrupted collaboration, mutual learning, mutual communication, and knowledge sharing between the partner companies.
In conclusion, this study produced two conceptual models conceptualising the link between sensemaking and SP as it played out in a Sino-NZ IJV. It contributes new insights about collaboration, sensemaking, and SP to the IJV, sensemaking and strategy literatures. At the heart of the contributions are two theoretical models that explain how sensemaking and SP combine to create participants’ sense of an IJV collaboration, answer the research questions, and address an important gap in these literatures. The research findings suggest that improving sensemaking ability should be considered as an important strategic management skill, and should be included in training agendas for managers who operate IJVs.",,,,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/13341",,"en","English",,"University of Canterbury",,,,,"http://library.canterbury.ac.nz/thesis/etheses_copyright.shtml",,"All Rights Reserved",,,,,,,"international business collaboration (IBC), international joint venture (IJV), dairy industry, sensemaking, strategy practice",,,,"A case study of an international joint venture : how key stakeholders make sense of their experience of a Sino-New Zealand collaboration.",,,"Electronic Thesis or Dissertation",,"Business Administration",,,"University of Canterbury",,"Doctoral",,,"Doctor of Philosophy",,"2469594",,,"College of Business and Law, University of Canterbury",,,"lillianzhaoxl@gmail.com",,,,,,,,"Dr. Colleen Mills"
"17475","10092/839",,"Jackson, P. R.",,,,,,"2015",,"Complementarity formulations offer the opportunity to thoroughly investigate and clarify the problem
of investment in electricity generation capacity. While complementarity has been traditionally used in
the sphere of imperfect competition, we demonstrate it also can play a fundamental role in perfectly
competitive situations. We demonstrate that our approach offers richer understanding than the
traditional linear programming approach. We attempt no judgement as to the practical benefit of our
approach, as the benefits themselves depend on the data of the specific counter-factual used. The
disadvantages of our approach are somewhat clearer. We acknowledge that the formulations that result
are computationally challenging and that the various standard solution methods available for
complementarity problems may not actually represent efficient solution methods for such problems.
Nevertheless, we adopt the complementarity framework, as ours is a purely theoretical thesis, designed
to explore the potential of a unique solution approach to an oft-solved problem. Complementarity
theory provides an environment for developing theoretical formulations that, in many cases, resolve
directly from an optimisation problem, but it is also free to include other conditions where required.

After a brief introduction and literature review, Chapter 1 considers the finer detail of
traditional solution approaches, including the use of screening curves, linear programming, and a
related complementarity problem. Screening curves were traditionally used in the times of central
planning to describe the optimal trade-off between technologies in terms of utilisation, and with the
addition of a Load Duration Curve, the optimal capacity of each technology. We explore various
representations of the LDC and discuss how these interact with investment conditions and how market
clearing procedures are viewed in their context. We show, with the use of an example, that LP
approaches are incapable of accurately defining key system performance measures such as the Loss of
Load Probability, without either “guidance” from the modeller or through the use of a significant
number of load classes or slices. Furthermore, we show that supposedly perfectly competitive models
produce prices that are either inconsistent with the perfect competition they are predicated on, or
inconsistent with the optimal capacity suggested by the model. Our investigation identifies the reason
for this deficiency.

Optimal trade-offs have a useful theoretical function, but they also emphasise the nature of the
technological choice, and ultimately when the trade-off is with a notional shortage technology, they
describe the nature of the total capacity choice. But the screening curve approach quickly succumbs to
complexity, and is often replaced by optimisation in the form of linear programming, in which a
significant number of constraints could be more easily expressed. Nevertheless, the screening curve
concept has some conceptual advantages that we can integrate into the analysis, namely the
determination of utilisation levels corresponding to optimal technological trade-offs. Knowing that the
traditional LP approach does not accurately reflect the relative timing of investment and operation decisions, or produce solutions that are independent of the LDC definition, we consider the integration
of screening curve logic. By way of resolving the downsides of the LP approach, we develop a
complementarity formulation that combines the LP solution with the logic of screening curves to derive
a problem representation that enables an accurate and consistent solution to the simple problem. In
doing so, we make clear that screening curves, per se, are not the motivation, but the vehicle for
determining an optimal representation of the system.

Complicating the investor’s decision processes are several technological issues, the relevance
of which might vary from market to market, but should be considered. Chapter 3 describes a nonexhaustive
range of typical problem extensions that would challenge screening curve analysis and how
our basic approach can be adapted to include these. This is important for several reasons. Firstly, it is
important we demonstrate the overall extensibility of the approach. Secondly, each extension involves
discussion of both the extension itself, which in many cases is represented can be accommodated by
additional constraints or altered objectives in the underlying optimisation problem, but also the way in
which these extensions impact on the definition of the optimal system representation. In deriving the
optimal system representation, we develop duality based pseudo-screening curves to describe optimal
trade-offs in particular situations or scenarios. By way of example, we consider the relatively standard
fare of cost structure generalisation, capacity inflexibility, energy limits and storage, and finally the
formulation and interpretation of configurable technologies as non-linear notional technologies.

In Chapter 4 we refocus on load. We consider demand response in two forms: the short-term
demand response that typically requires investment and can be written as a technology, and the wider
type of demand response that comes as a result of adjusting consumption patterns and substitutions. By
nature, the latter response is based on longer term considerations and, in the spirit of the investment
problem, we develop an approach to including this response in a fashion that excludes this form of
demand response from behaving as a marginal technology in the electricity market. We then consider
reliability using an endogenous augmented LDC formulation. Finally, we present a formulation and
investment analysis of intermittent generation based on a chronological load and generation pattern.
This case requires the introduction of an additional level of dynamic LDC generation, and the
maintenance of a dynamic mapping between the LDC and the chronological load pattern.

No discussion of investment is complete without consideration of risk and uncertainty, and it
is therefore important to demonstrate how this can be addressed in our formulation, and what the
consequences of risk are. We begin by properly defining these terms before expanding the formulation
to consider how risk could be implemented. Our over-arching approach is to develop the framework in
accordance with the principles of Ralph & Smeers (2011), including contract market, whose clearance
defines the market price of risk endogenously. We distinguish between the perspective of portfolio
optimisation based on investor preferences and the perspective of risk constraints using an objective
function that combines the expected profits of the firm with a CVaR measure. Uncertainty is
presented as a distinct concept. Our presentation focuses on various conjectures and the implications
they have for the optimal investment condition.

Throughout the thesis, we use the structure of complementarity models as this is both
convenient and the basis of much prior research into similar questions. However, complementarity solution methods per se are not the focus of this research, and we refer the reader to those texts listed
for a detailed explanation of the theoretical properties and solution methods associated with
complementarity problems. We felt it important to be able to describe the problem within a single
framework rather than an ad hoc collection of algorithms, and aim to show that, even though
decomposing the problem and using algorithms may be more effective than standard complementarity
solvers, complementarity formulations can be implemented for a wide variety of purposes.",,,,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/14382",,"en","English",,"University of Canterbury",,,,,"http://library.canterbury.ac.nz/thesis/etheses_copyright.shtml",,"All Rights Reserved",,,,,,,,,,,"Complementarity modelling of investment in electricity generation capacity",,,"Electronic Thesis or Dissertation",,"Business Administration",,,"University of Canterbury",,"Doctoral",,,"Doctor of Philosophy",,"2529935",,,"College of Business and Law, University of Canterbury",,,"peter.jackson@pg.canterbury.ac.nz",,,,,,,,"Dr Shane Dye"
"16161","10092/839",,"Read, Julia",,,,,,"2017",,"In recent years, especially with the rise of fast fashion, the unsustainable and unethical nature of the clothing industry has come to light. Despite many consumers expressing concern and an intention to avoid unethical clothing consumption, this is often not reflected in their purchasing behaviour. To successfully understand how ethical clothing consumption can be encouraged, it is vital to first recognise the perceived barriers to this behaviour and to identify the key attributes which hold most importance to the consumer. To do so, this research defines major hindrances to ethical clothing consumption and subsequent solutions. The most prevalent barriers in the literature were identified as perceived cost, lack of information such as country of origin, lack of availability and attainability, lack of style and fashion, and unknown or undesirable brands. These formed the basis for the conjoint analysis which consequently determined what attributes and attribute levels were most important to, and preferred by, the participants. This survey was administered online on the Qualtrics platform and produced a total of 381 responses through Amazon’s Mechanical Turk. The responses were then analysed using descriptive statistics, ANOVA and correlation testing. The results indicated that overall, price and style were the most important attributes, followed by availability, information, country of origin and brand. Additionally, apathy, clothing involvement and purchase frequency were all tested to discover the relationship between these behavioural and psychographic traits and preferred attributes. Demographics such as age, gender, ethnicity, education and income were also tested. The theoretical and managerial implications of these findings, and the direction for future research are also discussed. This research provides an understanding of what attribute combinations or bundles can overcome the major perceived barriers to ethical clothing consumption. In doing so, this thesis creates an understanding of the ways in which ethical clothing consumption can be encouraged and consumer apathy towards this issue can be reduced.

"16158","10092/839","Austin, Neroli",,,,,,,"2016",,"This thesis constructs a DSGE model of the New Zealand economy based on Iacoviello
(2005). Its key innovation is the introduction of an investor property sector that allows
consideration of the loan-to-value (LVR) restrictions that the Reserve Bank of New
Zealand (RBNZ) recently implemented. These tools were employed in order to mitigate
the risks associated with highly leveraged investors with multiple exposures to the
housing market.

With the introduction of an investor sector, both patient and impatient households
are given the choice between owning and renting property. This decision is affected by
house prices relative to rental prices, the expected capital gains for home ownership, and
any LVR restrictions that the impatient households may face. By contrast, property
investors are assumed to have the choice between investing in capital or investing in
housing. This model therefore shows the impact of the trade off between investing in
housing and investing in capital on other variables in the economy.

The model shows that LVR restrictions work to stabilise output in the event of a monetary
policy or housing preference shock. In addition, the presence of LVR restrictions
affects the distribution of housing to different agents in the economy. Although risk is
not explicitly modelled in this framework, this suggests LVR restrictions may increase
financial stability by encouraging greater activity in the housing market from less risky
agents (such as patient households in this framework).",,,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/13437",,,"en","English",,"University of Canterbury",,,,,"http://library.canterbury.ac.nz/thesis/etheses_copyright.shtml",,"All Rights Reserved",,,,,,,,,,,"Macroprudential tools and monetary policy interactions in New Zealand",,,"Electronic Thesis or Dissertation",,,"Economics",,"University of Canterbury",,"Masters",,,"Master of Commerce",,"2479996",,,"College of Business and Law, University of Canterbury",,,"neroliaustin@gmail.com",,,,,,,,"Associate Professor Alfred Guender"
"16177","10092/839","Ibrahim, Muhammad Azman",,,,,,,"2016",,"This research focuses on Malaysian retailers' perception of and attitude towards organic
certification. Organic certification is one type of food certification that is used to demonstrate
product attributes in order to obtain consumer trust and also to differentiate between organic
and non-organic products. The primary purpose of food and organic certification is to provide
greater information and certainty to consumers as to the origins and nature of food as well as
to differentiate the product from those that do not fulfill certification requirements.
Certification also provides opportunities for retailers to develop operational and product
differentiation strategies that focusing on other qualities instead of pricing such as
convenience, providing variety, consistency, quality and safety. In addition, food and organic
certification may be important for retailers in strengthening their structural power in food
retail and as a retail sustainability strategy that influences consumer behavior related to
organic and related food products. The overwhelming majority of studies on food and organic
certification focus on consumer and producer perception rather than the retailer, yet retailers
contribute to consumer knowledge of, preferences for, as well as trust/mistrust in organic
products, as well as the overall availability of organic foods in the food supply chain. In
addition, previous research that has been conducted on the importance of food and organic
certification in food retail was mainly undertaken in developed countries, with organic food
retailing in developing countries and Malaysia specifically, little understood. Therefore, the
purpose of this research retailers' perception is to understand Malaysian food retailers’
perception of and attitude towards organic certification.

This research took a two-stage mixed method approach to collect data in order to fulfill the
research objectives. Research was undertaken by the use of a semi-structured interview with
public and private stakeholders in Malaysian food retailing as well as a survey of 102
Malaysian retailers. This research found that organic certification attributes are related to
trust, credibility, food safety and quality, environment and traceability. Participants perceived
that organic certification is important to ensure the safety and quality of organic food
products. Participants also noted that other food certifications have their importance in
determining the safety and quality of food products. In Malaysia, where the majority of the
population is Muslim, halal certification is perceived to be the most important assurance.
However, this research also suggested that organic certification is significant in its own right
for some markets while there are potential overlaps between different certifications. However,
respondents felt that consumers required greater education on the concept in order to not only encourage consumption of organic products but also to help give consumers greater
confidence in their purchasing. In addition, potential needs for improvements in the
certification and regulation framework were also identified.",,,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/13463",,,"en","English",,"University of Canterbury",,,,,"http://library.canterbury.ac.nz/thesis/etheses_copyright.shtml",,"All Rights Reserved",,,,,,,"Food certification, alternative food networks, food retailing, organic certification, retailer, Malaysia",,,,"Understanding Malaysian food retailers’ perception of and attitude towards organic certification.",,,"Electronic Thesis or Dissertation",,,"Business Administration",,"University of Canterbury",,"Doctoral",,,"Doctor of Philosophy",,"2483475",,,"College of Business and Law, University of Canterbury",,,"muhammad.ibrahim@pg.canterbury.ac.nz",,,,,,,,"Professor Dr. Colin Michael Hall and Professor Dr. Paul Ballantine"
"16179","10092/839",,"Wordsworth, Russell",,,,,,"2017",,"Voluntary turnover has been the subject of scholarly inquiry for more than 100 years
and much is understood about the drivers of turnover, and the decision-making processes 
involved. To date most models of voluntary turnover have assumed a rational and sequential 
decision process, initiated primarily by dissatisfaction with the job and the perceived 
availability of alternatives. Operating within a strong predictive research agenda, countless 
studies have sought to validate, extend and refine these traditional models through the 
addition of distal antecedents, mediators, moderators, and proximal antecedents of turnover. 
The net result of this research is a large body of empirical support for a somewhat modest 
relationship between job dissatisfaction, perceived alternatives, turnover intentions, job 
search  behaviour and  actual  turnover.  Far less scholarly attention has been directed at 
understanding shock-induced turnover that is not necessarily derived from dissatisfaction. 
Moreover, almost no consideration has been given to understanding how a significant and 
commonly  experienced  extra-organisational shock, such  as  natural  disaster,  might impact 
turnover  decision  making. Additionally, the dynamic and cumulative impacts of multiple 
shocks on turnover decision making have to date not been examined by turnover researchers.

In addressing these gaps this thesis  presents a  leaver-centric  theory of employee 
turnover decision making that is grounded in the post-disaster context. Data for the study
were collected from in-depth interviews with 31 leavers in four  large  organisations in
Christchurch, New Zealand; an area that experienced a major natural disaster in the form of 
the Canterbury earthquake sequence.  This context provided a  unique  setting  in which to 
study turnover as the primary shock was followed by a series of smaller shocks, resulting in a 
period of sustained disruption to the pre-shock status quo. Grounded theory methods are 
used  to  develop  a typology  of  leaving  which  describes four  distinct  patterns  of  turnover 
decision making that follow a significant extra-organisational shock. The proposed typology 
not only addresses the heterogeneous and complex nature of turnover decision making, but 
also provides a more nuanced explanation of the turnover process explicating how the choice 
of decision path followed is influenced by four contextual factors which emerged from the data:  (1)  pre-shock motivational state; (2) decision difficulty; (3) experienced shock 
magnitude; and (4) the availability of resources. The  research findings address several 
shortcomings  in  the  extant  literature  on  employee  turnover, and offer practical 
recommendations for managers seeking to retain employees in a post-disaster setting.",,,,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/13465",,"en","English",,"University of Canterbury",,,,,"http://library.canterbury.ac.nz/thesis/etheses_copyright.shtml",,"All Rights Reserved",,,,,,,,,,,"When the shaking stops, the thinking starts : a grounded theory  of turnover decision making in the context of a significant extra-organisational shock.",,,"Electronic Thesis or Dissertation",,"Business Administration",,,"University of Canterbury",,"Doctoral",,,"Doctor of Philosophy",,"2483479",,,"College of Business and Law, University of Canterbury",,,"Russell.wordsworth@canterbury.ac.nz",,,,,,,,"Associate Prof. Venkataraman Nilakant"
"13727","10092/839",,"Gupta, Hritik",,,,,,"2015",,"Virtual teams (VTs) comprise knowledge workers who are geographically dispersed, may be constrained by different time zones, and primarily co-ordinate their work through suitable communication tools. Virtual teams are increasingly being used by corporate organisations due to their benefits such as access to international markets where there is an abundance of talent and cheaper expertise as well as provision of a flexible workforce.
The communication tool is an important component of a virtual team and VTs heavily rely on the communication tool for meeting their task specific and other needs. Existing literature on virtual team communication tools specifies email, videoconferencing, telephone, fax and social media tools such as blogs and wikis. Email, videoconferencing, telephone and fax are regarded as core virtual team communication tools. Corporate organisations are actively engaging with social media tools to meet their VTs’ day to day work needs such as communication, collaboration and knowledge sharing. In addition, social media tools also provide other benefits such an ability to create groups and initiate conversations, information broadcast and good social networking characteristics to name a few.
Virtual team dynamics such as trust, team cohesion, satisfaction, conflicts, communication effectiveness and leadership are key to how well virtual teams function. Previous research has attempted to explain the relationship between the communication tool and virtual team dynamics however the relevance of this relationship in the context of social media tools remains unanswered. To this end, this research contributes by empirically examining the effect of social media tools on virtual team dynamics; trust, team cohesion, satisfaction, conflicts, communication effectiveness and leadership are investigated in this research.
This research builds upon the existing literature and explores the relationship between virtual team dynamics and the transactive memory system (TMS). Transactive memory system refers to the development of a shared internal system for encoding, storing and retrieval of information among the team members. A conceptual research model is developed and it posits that TMS mediates the relationship between social media tools and virtual team dynamics, a phenomenon which has not been investigated by any of the previous research studies.
The primary data is collected in form of a 6-point Likert questionnaire and semi-structured interviews. In following a mixed method research design, the research model is empirically tested and validated by performing a partial least squares structural equation modelling on the Likert questionnaire data during the quantitative phase. A nested modelling approach is used to understand TMS mediation. The qualitative phase provides a deeper insight into the phenomenon represented by the research model and contributes by providing a rich understanding of the factors that contribute to the results achieved in the quantitative phase.
The research findings are novel and fill the gaps in knowledge. First, the hypotheses testing showed a strong support for the research model which answered the research questions and helped achieve the research goals. Second, the qualitative findings provide an understanding of the underlying reasons which affected virtual team dynamics through the use of social media tools. Overall, the research findings indicate that TMS mediates the relationship between social media tools and each of the six virtual team dynamics under consideration: trust, team cohesion, satisfaction, conflicts, communication effectiveness, and leadership.
This research makes a number of contributions to theory and practice. First, underpinning the effect of social media tools on virtual team dynamics, this research contributes literature demonstrating this effect. Second, in examining the effect of social media tools on virtual team dynamics through a TMS lens, this research contributes a novel research model towards the literature on Information Systems, Psychology, Management and Organisational Studies. Third, this research extends the existing knowledge on virtual teams, social media tools, computer-mediated communication, group decision support systems, group support systems, electronic meeting systems and collaborative technologies. Finally, this research contributes to the transactive memory system theory through an application of this theory in the context of social media tools and also investigates the relationship between TMS and virtual team dynamics.
The practical relevance of this research lies in the guidelines for practitioners who work in virtual teams and use social media tools. It provides a reference for managers who are looking into the use of social media tools within their virtual teams. This research has implications for the ‘strategic’ internal use of social media tools within organisations to support work processes as well as the provisioning of a platform for nurturing the social aspects of the organisation.

"14882","10092/839",,"Dayal, Natasha",,,,,,"2016",,"This thesis aims to understand the presence of psychological ownership within an online brand community. Psychological ownership is becoming increasingly relevant in marketing, being able to provide benefits to both consumers and firms. Firms should therefore attempt to facilitate and capitalise on psychological ownership in their consumers. Brand communities are becoming a more and more common platform for consumers of a brand to use for information and interaction with the brand and other enthusiasts. Due to the strong feelings that brand community members generally have towards the focal brand, it is likely that psychological ownership feelings may also develop towards the brand. Therefore it is important to understand how psychological ownership can develop in a brand community context, and also how it can manifest in the attitudes and behaviours of members.
To achieve this aim, the present study used a grounded theory approach to guide the use of a single-case study. This enabled the gathering of comprehensive, qualitative data to discover new theory about the phenomena. The case study used was the online Volkswagen brand community, and members’ responses to the diesel emissions crisis of 2015/16. Data was collected in the form of Facebook comments in the Volkswagen online brand community. A total of 355 responses were thematically analysed before theoretical saturation was reached.
The results of the study found evidence of existing psychological ownership elements. Two of the routes to psychological ownership were identified within the brand community; coming to intimately know, and investing the self into the target of ownership. Additionally the outcomes of organisational commitment, citizenship behaviour, sense of loss, and escalation of commitment were proven to exist in the brand community. The study also presented new findings in relation to the little-studied collective psychological ownership and blame-shifting as a potential form of escalation of commitment.
The major conclusions that can be drawn from the present study are of significance to the marketing literature. Psychological ownership can occur towards a brand, and within the context of a brand community, thus opening the door for further research within these constructs. Based on the present study, it is recommended that managers attempt to facilitate psychological ownership within their own brand’s communities. Actions by firms such as facilitating interaction between members, asking members for help and ensuring favourable change processes is important in order to create and maintain consumer psychological ownership, while providing a positive workplace can ensure psychological ownership of their employees.",,,,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/12173",,"en","English",,"University of Canterbury",,,,,"http://library.canterbury.ac.nz/thesis/etheses_copyright.shtml",,"All Rights Reserved",,,,,,,,,,,"Psychological ownership in brand communities: the case of the Volkswagen diesel emissions scandal","Theses / Dissertations",,,,,"Marketing",,"University of Canterbury",,"Masters",,,"Master of Commerce",,"2321295",,,"College of Business and Law, University of Canterbury",,,"natashadayal1@gmail.com",,,,,,,,"Associate Professor Jörg Finsterwalder"

A conceptual model is developed to test these relationships where team identification, emotion and satisfaction are antecedent to concepts of team and event attachment. To empirically test the model, an online survey was created to sample the responses of All Blacks fans during the 2015 Rugby World Cup towards the constructs previously mentioned. A total of 343 responses were gathered after being recruited through social media and direct emailing methods. The hypotheses were then tested by using two step structural equation modelling to analyse the data. This analysis revealed that team identification was predictive of feelings of love, happiness and pride towards a team but showed no significant relationship to anger and sadness. The relationships between the discrete emotions and satisfaction were mixed, with love and pride showing no significant relationship, anger having a negative relationship and happiness having a positive relationship. Surprisingly, feelings of sadness towards the All Blacks also had a positive relationship with satisfaction. The satisfaction construct itself was not a significant predictor of team or event attachment.

"13022","10092/839",,"Ma, Xinding",,,,,,"2015",,"Purpose: The purpose of this study is to investigate the current state of cloud computing within the accounting industry, by studying how cloud computing technology had been used by accounting firms, and the factors that led to this rapid growth of cloud computing over the last few years. There is virtually no prior empirical research on cloud computing in the context of accounting. 

Design and Methodology: the case study methodology is used, which consisted of six accounting firms. Semi-structured interviews are carried out with key personnel in the firms, focusing on how cloud-based software is used, and the reasons why they chose cloud-based software.

Findings: findings suggest that cloud computing should be differentiated into two categories: externally-focused and internally-focused. Cloud-based accounting software is widely used by the firms, and it improved the ability for accounting firms to collaborate with their clients, hence a competitively viable tool. Internally-focused cloud-based software, however, was not popular among the accounting firms.

Originality/value: this study highlights the importance of defining the scope of cloud computing (and information systems in general), and the introduction of strategic value into adoption studies. Moreover, this study provides some empirical evidence into the under-researched area of cloud accounting.",,,,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/11349",,"en",,,"University of Canterbury.

not have an effect on meeting expectations or endearing employees to expend more effort for the

appear to have more effect in convincing employees to reciprocate in positive ways. However the results

"13019","10092/839",,"Danková, Katarína",,,,,,"2015",,"This thesis consists of three chapters focusing on negative reciprocity, transparency and job assignment, and overconfidence. To test my hypotheses I use experimental economics methods, which offer control over the data generating process by motivating people financially. Experimental methods are used to identify causal processes and motivations that can be confounded in field settings. Economics experiments reduce response noise, e.g. extreme outliers probably caused by thoughtless, unmotivated subjects (Smith and Walker, 1993). The central theme of my first two experiments is reciprocity – a kind reaction to kind and generous behaviour and retaliation to hostile behaviour. The first chapter discusses reciprocity in connection with violation of the property rights and the source of the endowment on an individual level. In the second chapter the reciprocity is studied in an employer-worker setting, in the presence of social comparisons. The last chapter deals with firm’s overconfidence when deciding about entering the market. All of the chapters study aspects of economic behaviour in social contexts, which have implications for the field. Each of the chapters is described briefly below.
My first chapter experimentally explores the impact of the strength of property rights on retaliation decisions. I induce strong property rights by having experimental subjects earn money by performing a real effort task and weak property rights by endowing them with windfall gains. I ask whether people are less likely to respond to a hostile behaviour with retaliation when earned money as opposed to windfall money is at stake. My experimental design identifies two reasons why property rights might influence the size and frequency of retaliation. The first reason is that retaliation might be perceived to be more costly when using earned as opposed to windfall money to pay for retaliation. The second reason is related to the violation of property rights. If another person decreases a decision-maker’s endowment and the endowment consists of earned money rather than windfall money, the decision-maker might consider it to be a stronger violation of his property rights, which in turn could trigger stronger retaliation. The purpose of this experiment is to separate these two effects. While I find support for the fact that subjects retaliate more because of the violation of their property rights, I also find that participants actually retaliate more with their earned money than with windfall. This suggests that participants do not perceive such retaliation to be more costly but rather that their behaviour is driven by violation of property rights.
The second chapter focuses on the fairness perceptions of the job assignment process in an employer-worker relationship. In reality, employers have at their disposal jobs of different importance, which have to be assigned to different workers. Workers in more important jobs usually get offered higher wages and workers in less important jobs get offered lower wages. If the interpersonal concerns were absent, the employer would provide a higher wage to the worker in the more important job. When a worker decides what wage to accept, he may compare his wage to the other workers’ wage. An employer anticipating this might adjust the wage policy in order to avoid unnecessary losses or to maximise profits. I experimentally study the fairness perceptions from the workers’ and the employer’s point of view. I ask the following questions: 1. Do workers react to the wages paid to their co-workers and does the job assignment procedure affect workers’ wage rejections? 2. Do employers react to the fact that workers compare themselves with their co-workers and do they compress wages when the job assignment procedure is perceived less fair? These questions have implications for labour market, in particular a firm’s wage policy. If an unfair assignment elicits more wage rejections (i.e. zero profit for the employer and zero wage for the worker) due to social comparisons, it can have detrimental effects on the performance of the firm and thus firms might choose to practice wages secrecy. I examine the impact of job assignment in the presence of social comparisons. In order to test for social comparisons, the worker is only informed about the wage that the employer offered to his co-worker and which job he has been assigned to. Only after workers state their minimum acceptable offers, which determine if the offered wage is accepted or rejected, they come to know their own wage. I posit that a worker’s reaction to a specific job assignment depends on the procedure by which they are allocated to the jobs. An assignment to a less important job will not be perceived as unfair if it arises from an unbiased procedure, for example random assignment with equal probabilities. It will, however, be perceived as unfair if workers think that the employer favours some workers over others for reasons that are unrelated to efficiency concerns. This experiment does not provide evidence on social comparisons or employers compressing wages when the assignment to jobs is perceived unfair.
My third chapter is a replication of the high-impact overconfidence and excess entry experiment by Camerer and Lovallo (1999). The topic of overconfidence is crucial for understanding business failures. Camerer and Lovallo were first to directly test overconfidence by measuring economic decisions and personal overconfidence at the same time. Camerer and Lovallo test whether managers’ overconfidence about their skills could predictably influence economic behaviour when entering into markets. I implemented Camerer and Lovallo’s experiment with modifications reflecting the technological progress of economic experiments of past 15 years. While Camerer and Lovallo run their experiment with male participants (who have been shown to be more overconfident than females), my experiment studies the effect of overconfidence of both genders, making it a more conservative test.
The thesis employs cutting edge techniques from Experimental Economics to study economic decision-making. My research provides empirical evidence on violation of property rights, fairness considerations in labour markets and impact of overconfidence on market entry decisions.",,,,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/11346",,"en",,,"University of Canterbury.

Prior research has not examined these variables in conjunction; this study looks for both direct and interaction effects of eroticism and dominance on consent.
Participants undertook an online questionnaire and were sorted into a control group which saw no image, or exposed to one of four images. These four conditions were manipulated by level of eroticism (non-erotic or eroticised), and by whether the male or female character was portrayed as more dominant. Participants then answered a series of questions relating to their attitudes about sexual consent. Image response data and demographic information was also collected.
Results did not indicate any significant direct effects of eroticism or dominance on perceptions of sexual consent. However the interaction effect of these two variables did approach significance on two consent measures. Some of the image and consent measures were found to have small but significant correlations; significant covariate relationships were also identified. In particular, participants’ gender identity was found to impact the Positive Attitude Toward Establishing Consent and Verbal Consent Norms subscales; participants’ ethnicity had an effect on Positive Attitude Toward Establishing Consent, and their marital status had a significant effect on their Indirect Behavioural Approach To Consent.

"13024","10092/839",,"Scobie, Matthew Russell",,,,,,"2015",,"This research aims to take an interdisciplinary approach to examine how two different strands of literature, sociology of risk and the Māori guardianship value of kaitiakitanga, can inform corporate, public and personal accountability in a conflict arena. This is not limited to economic accountability, but includes social, environmental and cultural impacts. Risk, accountability, and kaitiakitanga are deeply embedded in culture and socially constructed by actors within that culture. Furthermore, methods of managing accountability and risk are products of the prevailing culture within a society, including reporting, risk communication, and the precautionary principle.

The conflict arena in this study is the engagement around deep sea petroleum exploration in Aotearoa New Zealand. This was selected because it is a relatively new practice in New Zealand and has caused significant controversy. As an overarching methodology, a critical discourse analysis has been used. Within critical discourse analysis, Renn’s (1992) arena framework has provided the investigative tool to examine communications among actors and how they relate to one another, and Beck’s (1992) risk society has been used as a lens to understand why actors behave in this manner. Conversations were held with vocal actors who are actively engaged in the deep sea petroleum exploration arena including industry and government agency representatives, activists, iwi members, city councillors, opposition MPs, local business owners and media in order to hear their stories and interpretations of the conflict. Additionally, documentary and media reviews were performed to contextualise and further develop findings.

This research has uncovered the discourse tool woven throughout accountability, risk and environmental politics, which is the use of powerful story-lines. “Risk refers to uncertainty about and severity of the events and consequences (or outcomes) of an activity with respect to something that humans value” (Aven & Renn, 2009, p. 6) - or what could happen. Accountability is providing a credible story about what is happening now, what could happen next, how one will respond, and why an activity should or should not go ahead.

The most significant contribution of this thesis is a broadly constructed interpretation of accountability for risk in a controversial, environmentally sensitive industry from a range of social and cultural perspectives. This research will also provide insights into how multi or transnational corporations and affected stakeholders engage with one another, and how this can be emulated or improved by all actors involved.",,,,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/11380",,"en",,,"University of Canterbury.

"15762","10092/839","Mudgway, Cassandra",,,,,,,"2016",,"Allegations of sexual exploitation and abuse against UN peacekeepers over the past decade prompted a “zero-tolerance” policy response from high-level UN officials. To facilitate this policy, the UN has initiated and implemented various preventative and responsive measures. Despite the raft of reforms, it is the troop-contributing countries (TCCs) which have exclusive criminal jurisdiction over their military contingent members and the current framework has been criticised for failing to ensure accountability of offenders.
In this thesis I explore alternative ways in which the United Nations can improve accountability for sexual exploitation and abuse committed by military contingent members within its peacekeeping personnel. Applying a feminist lens, I assess these options guided by three underlying principles; justice being seen to be done, host state ownership, and UN leadership. I first discuss the concepts of sexual exploitation and abuse as defined by the UN. Second, I explore whether TCCs could or should be sanctioned for failing to exercise criminal jurisdiction. Third, I investigate alternative ways to hold individual peacekeepers to account and fourth, I consider the role victims of sexual exploitation and abuse have to play and the remedies to which they may be entitled.
I conclude that it is time for the UN to implement a different solution and remove TCCs’ exclusive criminal jurisdiction. I argue that a hybrid court for peacekeepers is the better alternative to hold individual perpetrators to account. A hybrid court would incorporate host state ownership and provide a clear structure for TCC cooperation and UN leadership. Additionally, victim inclusivity would be an important feature of such a court. Victims are entitled to effective remedies and I put forward recommendations for targeted and transformative reparations. I also recommend a re-draft of the definition of “sexual exploitation” to better reflect the primary targeted conduct of survival sex.",,,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/12914",,,"en","English",,"University of Canterbury",,,,,"http://library.canterbury.ac.nz/thesis/etheses_copyright.shtml",,"All Rights Reserved",,,,,,,,,,,"Sexual exploitation and abuse by UN peacekeepers: towards a hybrid solution","Theses / Dissertations",,,,,,,"University of Canterbury",,"Doctoral",,,"Doctor of Philosophy",,,,,"College of Business and Law, University of Canterbury",,,"Cassandra.mudgway@gmail.com",,,,,,,,"Associate Professor Annick Masselot"
"13023","10092/839",,"Rillstone, Jonathan Marshall",,,,,"2015",,"Traditional tax compliance policy is based on a deterrence approach, whereby compliance is achieved through a tax authority’s threats of penalties and audits. This policy is based on Allingham & Sandmo’s (1972) standard model of tax evasion, which posits that an increase in the probability of detection and punishment will, ceteris paribus, lead to an increase in compliance. However, this model has been criticised for lacking explanatory power for the majority of observed tax compliance behaviour. Consequently, a body of research has developed which attempts to identify the factors which influence compliance behaviour in addition to deterrence measures. This research has focused upon the concept of tax morale; a concept which broadly refers to the attitudes and beliefs of taxpayers which can influence their compliance behaviour. The concept of tax morale has developed into a growing area of research which investigates the potential for utilising the ‘carrot’ to encourage voluntary compliance, and reducing the reliance on the ‘stick’ to coerce compliance (Kornhauser, 2007; Torgler, 2007). 

One carrot which has been identified as having the potential to improve tax compliance is the use of rewards for compliant taxpayers. Several theoretical and experimental studies have been undertaken which have investigated the impact of rewards on participants’ tax compliance behaviour, and have indicated that the use of rewards is potentially an effective means of improving compliance behaviour. However, there is an absence of research focused on gaining an understanding of the views and opinions of tax practitioners and taxpayers regarding the potential introduction of a reward system. As such, a qualitative research approach utilising semi-structured interviews was adopted, in which interviews were conducted with five tax practitioners and two small business owners. These interviews covered issues such as the potential effectiveness of using rewards to encourage compliance, the features which should be included in a reward system, and the feasibility of implementing such a system.  

The findings from the interviews indicate that the use of rewards could be a more effective means of improving the compliance behaviour of non-compliant taxpayers, as opposed to the sole use of deterrence measures. In addition, it was thought that the use of rewards could also be an effective way of maintaining the compliance of honest taxpayers and reducing the risk of such taxpayers acting opportunistically in the future. Furthermore, it was found that the use of rewards for compliant taxpayers could also reduce the risk of the ‘bomb-crater’ effect occurring. 

In regard to the features of a potential reward system, it was found that there was a strong preference for the use of financial rewards, which would be administered in the form of a percentage rebate. However, it was also noted that certain types of non-financial rewards could also be effective, particularly for maintaining the compliance of honest taxpayers. A key finding arising from the research is that in order for a reward system to successfully induce non-compliant taxpayers to become compliant, it is very likely that the reward system would need to be introduced in conjunction with a tax amnesty.

In regard to the feasibility of introducing a reward system in New Zealand, the findings indicated some doubts as to the ability of Inland Revenue’s Information Technology (IT) system to adequately implement a reward system. However, these concerns were tempered by the fact that Inland Revenue is due to receive a $1.5b upgrade of its IT system over the next ten years, which the practitioners expected would be able to competently handle the implementation of a reward system. Furthermore, the findings indicated that it should be relatively straightforward for Inland Revenue to operate such a system. Finally, the findings highlighted several issues and challenges which Inland Revenue would need to overcome in order to successfully implement a reward system, which could impact upon Inland Revenue’s amenability to adopt such an approach.",,,,,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/11368","en",,,"University of Canterbury.

"13116","10092/839",,"Leadley, Alexandra",,,,,,"2015",,"This thesis explores how designers within the New Zealand designer fashion industry manage the interface between business development and designer aesthetic, then materialise this on the catwalk. The investigation is guided by two research questions. The first looks specifically at finding the creativity-business balance, asking how designers manage their business development processes while considering their aesthetic. The second shifts to the fabrication of this interface, inquiring into how designers experience the process of materialising on the catwalk.
A qualitative exploratory research design was implemented in order to collect the data for this research, taking an interpretive approach. Under this approach nine designers who presented collections at the 2014 iD Fashion Show were interviewed. In-depth analysis was conducted on the data provided by these designers.
The data analysis revealed the importance of identifying showing objectives. These objectives provide a valuable insight into how designers manage the interface between creativity and business aspects. It was found that showing objectives were established by determining a designer’s enterprise orientation and identifying their target audience. Mills (2011a, 2011b) developed the concept of enterprise orientations, highlighting features of businesses that distinguish their orientation. This research revealed that target audiences are based upon the businesses’ stage of development.
The analysis went on to reveal modifying factors that influence the materialisation of these objectives. It explained that these factors can be categorised as limiting or enabling factors, and vary in degree of influence. The data revealed that modifying factors are either available resources (internal or external) or show conditions.
This research conceptualises the materialisation process experienced by New Zealand fashion designers when presenting a collection in a catwalk show. It summarises the process of materialisation graphically in a model. This model illustrates how showing objectives are first influenced by modifying factors before materialising on the catwalk. These findings stress the significant impact modifying factors can have on catwalk presentations.
The contribution this research makes is particularly significant. Despite its growth and economic importance the existing scholarly research into the New Zealand designer fashion industry is scarce. Specifically, this investigation was designed to close a gap in the existing literature, advancing understanding of designer aesthetics and the creativity-business tension as well as providing new insight into how this materialises on the catwalk. This information is particularly valuable for fashion designers, business support people, PR practitioners, industry bodies, design education providers, and the New Zealand Government. Each of these parties may benefit significantly from a greater understanding of the tension between business processes and creativity and the increased insight into the catwalk as a platform for materialisation. Though the findings make a welcome contribution to the existing literature, there is scope for future research to build on the understandings developed from this research.",,,,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/11350",,"en",,,"University of Canterbury.

"16091","10092/839","Abu-Hijleh, Mohammed",,,,,,,"2016",,"Transfer pricing (the pricing of cross border transactions between controlled or related parties) is an important tax issue faced by multinational enterprises (MNEs). The Inland Revenue Department (IRD) initiated the Advance Pricing Agreement (APA) program in 1999/2000 as a more co-operative approach for MNEs to addressing transfer pricing compliance. An APA is an agreement negotiated in advance between a taxpayer and a tax authority that sets the price of cross border intra-firm transactions between related parties over a fixed period of time. This study evaluates the New Zealand APA process with a main focus of gaining an insight of how the program operates. Eight interviews comprising three participants from the IRD and five tax practitioners from the ‘Big 4’ accounting firms were conducted, in order to gain an insight into the New Zealand APA process. This was supplemented beforehand by documentary analysis of the New Zealand APA process and other sources of data. Further, the study reviews the APA processes of other tax jurisdictions, namely Australia, the United Kingdom, and the United States. A comparative case study analysis approach is utilised to see how these tax jurisdictions’ APA processes compare to New Zealand’s APA process.

The findings of this research reveal that New Zealand has maintained an informal APA process, where all MNE applicants are welcome to apply regardless of complexity, size or degree of risk involved in any of their transactions proposed to be covered under the APA. This was also seen as a key difference in the approach the IRD maintains towards APAs compared to the APA processes of other comparative tax jurisdictions’ considered in this study. All interviewees perceived the New Zealand APA process well in terms of how it works and what it achieves. It was believed to be an attractive solution for all MNEs operating in New Zealand wanting to gain certainty around their transfer pricing tax affairs. An opportunity for New Zealand Customs to incorporate APAs as an acceptable valuation method for MNEs to price their imports is also identified in this study. However, many obstacles are identified as to why this may prove to be a challenge for New Zealand Customs to implement.

Stakeholder engagement as a concept has been advocated as an ideal way for these
relationships to manifest themselves. This research clarifies the concept of stakeholder

Stakeholder engagement was largely absent from the relationships described with only one
relationship matching the character that has been described in the literature. It was found that
in New Zealand organisations tended to be very business focused in their organisational
reports and in their relationships with stakeholders. This resulted in organisation dominated
relationships with a narrow range of stakeholders being interacted with. The importance of
the practitioners themselves was a prominent theme that emerged during the research. The
values of the practitioners came through as being very strong as did a desire to persuade
others of the importance of non-financial reporting and its related issues.

optimisation, such as Stochastic Linear Programming. This also creates price differences between
locations, and time periods, and causes the market to accumulate a “settlement surplus” of rents
associated with resource constraints. This thesis draws on the Financial Transmission Right (FTR)
concepts developed for electricity markets to outline a general structure of financial hedging
instruments that could be used to deploy this settlement surplus to hedge against price risks, across
space and time. We also consider a swing option based approach, which bundles the above rights to
create a virtual “slice of system” model that could be practically and conceptually appealing to both
aggregated and disaggregated hydro reservoir systems. While only preliminary, our discussion of these
options suggests that developments along these lines may be important in creating a water market
environment that is acceptable to potential consumptive and non-consumptive participants.

The remainder of this thesis is about the problem of intra-period consumptive and non-consumptive
water allocation in a mixed-use catchment. We develop a deterministic nodal Constructive Dual
Dynamic Programming (CDDP) procedure which implicitly clears a market determining both
consumptive and non-consumptive water allocations, across all nodes in a catchment with a single
reservoir. Consumptive users extract water from the system, so each unit of water flow can only be used
for a single consumptive use. A non-consumptive user transfers water from one node to another, extracting some benefit, or incurring some cost. Arc flow bounds may limit the opportunities for using
water at the nodes. Costs can be associated with arc flow bounds and distributary demands to represent
in-stream and environmental reserve flows enforced using penalty costs. The algorithm constructs the
intra-period demand curve for release by sequentially forming marginal water value curves at each
node, passing these curves towards the reservoir.

This approach can generate net demand curves representing all possible market-clearing solutions at
nodal and user levels. It can also be used to construct net demand curves for water release from the
reservoir, in each period, which could then be used in a stochastic inter-temporal CDDP model to
construct marginal water value curves stored in the reservoir over an appropriate time horizon. Several
variants on this approach are explored.

We discuss extending the procedure to assess the marginal value of water stored in two inter-connected
reservoirs in a mixed-use catchment. A “lower level” intra-period CDDP is applied to construct a two
dimensional “demand surface” for transfer, representing the marginal benefit from net release into
either end of the inter-reservoir chain between the two reservoirs. Then a higher level inter-period
CDDP demand-curve-adding method could be deployed to strike the optimal trade-off between the
current release demands for the inter-reservoir chain and other sub-trees leading from the two reservoirs
and the future storage demands.",,,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/13415",,,"en","English",,"University of Canterbury",,,,,"http://library.canterbury.ac.nz/thesis/etheses_copyright.shtml",,"All Rights Reserved",,,,,,,,,,,"An integrated water-electricity market design for multi reservoir, mixed operation.",,,"Electronic Thesis or Dissertation",,,"Business Administration",,"University of Canterbury",,"Doctoral",,,"Doctor of Philosophy",,"2470424",,,"College of Business and Law, University of Canterbury",,,"ucresearchrepository@canterbury.ac.nz",,,,,,,,"Dr. Shane Dye"

Although previous research has used single-shot cases or surveys to study interventions there is little knowledge of the extent to which interventions result in sustainable personal or organisational behaviour over time. Therefore this thesis specifically focuses on identifying those studies in the literature that are longitudinal in nature to gain a better understanding of sustainable behaviour change. A systematic review was conducted to identify relevant studies. The systematic search returned a total of 333 papers relating to energy use, and 430 papers relating to water use. After screening and reviewing those returned papers against a predetermined, and specific criteria, only two papers relating to each topic remained. The two papers for each topic were then analysed and specific factors noted. The most effective outcomes of the energy papers were that of investing in modern, efficient technologies, and that of investing in and managing education of staff. The most effective outcomes of the water papers were again that of upgrading to modern, water-efficient equipment, and effective management of water resources. However, a critical finding was the absence of longitudinal studies of interventions which raises significant questions regarding the helpfulness of previous findings based on one-shot studies alone. The research was also the first of its kind looking at long-term interventions within sustainable tourism, and provides many avenues for future research.",,,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/13416",,,"en","English",,"University of Canterbury",,,,,"http://library.canterbury.ac.nz/thesis/etheses_copyright.shtml",,"All Rights Reserved",,,,,,,,,,,"Tourism’s impact on the environment : a systematic review of energy and water interventions.",,,"Electronic Thesis or Dissertation",,,"Business Administration",,"University of Canterbury",,"Masters",,,"Master of Commerce",,"2470425",,,"College of Business and Law, University of Canterbury",,,"Leroy.paul.andrews@gmail.com",,,,,,,,"Professor C.

"15835","10092/839",,"Suresh, Balan",,,,,,"1994",,"Over the past decade, the declining competitiveness of U.S. and European manufacturers had received considerable attention. Various studies have documented their weakening competitive position in global markets; the decline of their manufacturing base; and the continued closure of manufacturing plants in U.S. and Europe. Attention has been focused on manufacturing strategy and technological innovations in manufacturing as providing possible solutions to these growing problems. The adoption and implementation of new manufacturing technologies, known collectively as advanced manufacturing technology (AMT), has offered the promise of successfully competing in global markets. Specifically, these technologies have offered advantages in the areas that U.S. and European manufacturers need to address: flexibility, quality, shorter product life cycles, and shorter product development cycles. However, there are two major concerns: (1) U.S. and European manufacturers have been slow to adopt advanced process technology, and (2) those firms which did adopt these new technologies have had limited success in their implementation.

In spite of its growing importance in manufacturing, management generally has limited experience with AMT and few guidelines to assist them in the transition from the factory of today to the factory of the future. This research study aims to provide an in-depth, integrative approach to addressing the issues involved in the adoption, implementation and evaluation of AMT by focusing on the experience of organisations pursuing a strategy of automation.

Using a multiple case research methodology at plant level, the first part of the study investigates the reasons why European firms choose to adopt advanced manufacturing technologies and the decision making process involved in justifying them. In addition, this study identifies obstacles to justification and provides an understanding of how firms have either ignored or overcome these obstacles. The decision to adopt AMT is only the first step in becoming or remaining competitive. Such technologies need to be successfully implemented to achieve desired benefits. The study also investigates how firms managed their AMT implementation and the obstacles that were encountered. In addition, those factors that contribute to or impede the successful implementation of AMT are identified. The difficulties of performing post-implementation evaluations by these firms are also examined. Emphasising the use of automation as a management decision concerned only with manufacturing is not sufficient. Wider issues in the management of manufacturing technology also need to be addressed. This study highlights the importance of top management involvement in new technology development, time-based competition, and outsourcing of technology in the management of manufacturing technology. It is hoped that by offering general explanations of the key issues in the management processes of adoption, implementation and evaluation of AMT, management will be assisted in their future efforts in dealing with these processes.

The participating firms identified both individual and synergistic benefits from the application of AMT in the competitive performance measures in manufacturing, cost, quality, delivery, and flexibility. They also underscored the importance of incorporating technology management issues while formulating business strategies, because these issues were believed to influence the business performance measures, profitability level, generation of increased sales, and creation of new opportunities and facilities. Using questionnaire surveys of the participating firms, the second part of this study explores the relationships between the management processes of AMT and performance measures in manufacturing, and between some factors of effective management of technology identified in this study, and the business performance measures of a firm. Tests of hypotheses formulated confirm that the perceived benefits in manufacturing performance could be achieved. Additional statistical analyses show that, through effective management of technology, the business performance measures of a firm could be improved.",,,,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/13025",,"en","English",,"University of Canterbury",,,,,"http://library.canterbury.ac.nz/thesis/etheses_copyright.shtml",,"All Rights Reserved",,,,,,,,,,,"Manufacturing technology management : key issues in the adoption, implementation and evaluation of advanced manufacturing technology","Theses / Dissertations",,,,,"Business Administration",,"University of Canterbury",,"Doctoral",,,"Doctor of Philosophy",,,"530243",,"College of Business and Law, University of Canterbury",,,"ucresearchrepository@canterbury.ac.nz",,,,,,,,"Dr Himangshu Paul"
"15825","10092/839",,"Floyd, Callum",,,,,,"2001",,"This research addresses the issue of diversity of organisational forms in franchising, which despite its prevalence, is poorly understood. The research focuses on the choice between three categories, consisting of five common types, of franchising: single-unit franchising, direct multi-unit (sequential franchising and area development) and indirect multi-unit (area representation and subfranchising) franchising forms.

The thesis presents and tests a contingency model that explores the influence of environmental (munificence, complexity and dynamism) and task (task complexity) uncertainties on choice of franchising form. Six factors were operationalised to represent environmental and task uncertainties. These factors included demand size and growth (environmental munificence), demand dispersion and heterogeneity (environmental complexity), intensity of rivalry (environmental dynamism) and task complexity (task uncertainty).

A multi-case study research strategy was conducted to test the contingency model. The strategy involved interviews with founders, other franchisor executives and franchisees, and also considered documentation and direct observations. The sample comprised a heterogeneous selection of seven New Zealand founded franchise systems. Companies were theoretically selected to ensure all five types of franchising were represented.

The findings illustrated general support for the thesis that environmental and task uncertainties do influence choices made between alternative franchising forms. Most companies adopted types of franchising that were consistent with expectations derived from the model. Importantly, however, the overall fit was not neat and conclusive. The explanatory power of individual factors varied and in some situations form choices occurred contrary to expectations.

This research produced further important findings. The qualitative methodology employed helped uncover five further drivers of franchising form choice. These additional factors related to individual choice and the firm, and included incentives, growth aspirations, need for control, resource constraints and franchisee aspirations. The findings also confirmed that no one factor or theory was sufficient to explain form choice, and the factors important in one company's decision might have little relevance to another's. Consequently, multiple perspectives were necessary to understand the decisions made by franchisors.",,,,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/13023",,"en","English",,"University of Canterbury",,,,,"http://library.canterbury.ac.nz/thesis/etheses_copyright.shtml",,"All Rights Reserved",,,,,,,,,,,"An organisation theory perspective on choice of franchising form","Theses / Dissertations",,,,,"Management",,"University of Canterbury",,"Doctoral",,,"Doctor of Philosophy",,,"825205",,"College of Business and Law, University of Canterbury",,,"ucresearchrepository@canterbury.ac.nz",,,,,,,,"Dr. V Nilakant"
"15083","10092/839",,"Philip, Heather E.",,,,,,"2016",,"Purpose. With the advent of social media and advances in Peer-to-Peer (P2P) online platforms, the 
phenomena of Collaborative Consumption (CC) has been developing in the popular press as a socioeconomic revolution that veers away from individual hyper-consumption and embraces the efficiencies of sharing and collaboration. In light of this groundswell, this thesis examines how twosided digital platforms mediate the behaviour of peers in two CC website types: (1) swapping; and (2) renting. 
Methodology. An exploration of philosophy for a sociological imagination yields the creation of a Model of Theoretical Perspectives inspired by critical realism. Using these philosophical foundations, semi-structured interviews with members of swapping and renting websites are conducted under the lens of an exploratory, grounded theory approach that asks, “What do we have here?”  
Findings. The nature of the experience for swapping and renting users is explained by dimensionalising the field of Collaborative Consumption using thematic analysis. Six referential questions are applied to Bardhi and Eckhardt’s (2012) dimensions of access-based consumption: what (Type of Transferred Object), how (Consumer Involvement), when (Temporality), where (Spatial Anonymity), with whom (Interpersonal Anonymity), and why (Market Mediation and Political Consumerism).  
Contributions. The nature of the experiences derived from these activities and how they may differ between user types is discussed. Motivating and deterring factors behind CC activities (swapping and renting) are compared and contrasted between different user types (Providers, Takers, and Non-Users). Findings from this study have implications for the design, implementation, and management of systems that encourage barter-trade and access-based forms of Collaborative Consumption. In particular, five enabling factors have been identified to overcome the deterrents for using these types of websites.

"15081","10092/839",,"Wright, Helen Anne",,,,,,"2014",,"The purpose of this thesis is to better understand why the social and environmental reporting practices of New Zealand business entities are ‘starting behind’ international counterparts. An integral aspect is gaining an understanding of the role of key players in the organisational field who have the potential to influence social and environmental reporting in New Zealand. This thesis is motivated by the importance of business entities pursuing sustainability-related practices, and being accountable for their actions through providing external social and environmental reports.  
The theoretical framework for this research is neo-institutional theory. The research method involved mapping the organisational field in order to identify players that influence, or have the potential to influence the social and environmental reporting practices of New Zealand business entities. Initially comprehensive background information was collected from websites, academic articles, surveys and a University of Canterbury archive. Subsequently semi-structured interviews were conducted with key players, Chief Executives from three Sustainable Business Intermediaries and Senior Executives from 11 of their members. Findings from the interviews were analysed through an iterative process allowing for emerging themes to be analysed using prior literature and explained through the lens of neo-institutional theory.   
The findings and analysis chapters are structured according to the research questions. Chapter six finds weak isomorphic pressures have influenced New Zealand business entities’ social and environmental reporting practices, but have not institutionalised this practice. The rationales of accountability and the business case have both motivated and caused resistance to business entities’ engagement in social and environmental reporting. Chapter seven finds the role of Sustainable Business Intermediaries facilitates weak isomorphic pressures on members’ social and environmental reporting practice. However, the business case rationale results in resistance to the practice of social and environmental reporting with legitimacy a key focus of these field players. Although coercive pressure in New Zealand is weak or lacking there is potential through field players’ roles to influence or enforce coercive pressure. The research concludes with recommendations that the New Zealand government should regulate social and environmental reporting.  
There has been extensive research focusing on various aspects of social and environmental reporting. However, there is little work focusing on the role and influence of field players through engagement-based research. Hence filling this gap extends the understanding of key field players’ influence on and interest in institutionalising social and environmental reporting and why this practice is resisted. Ultimately this research offers policy recommendations for the New Zealand government.",,,,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/12509",,"en","English",,"University of Canterbury",,,,,"http://library.canterbury.ac.nz/thesis/etheses_copyright.shtml",,"All Rights Reserved",,,,,,,,,,,"“Social and environmental reporting in New Zealand : analysing the (non)-institutionalisation of practice”","Theses / Dissertations",,,,,"Accountancy",,"University of Canterbury",,"Masters",,,"Master of Commerce",,"2348677",,,"College of Business and Law, University of Canterbury",,,"ucresearchrepository@canterbury.ac.nz",,,,,,,,"Dr. Helen Tregidga and Professor Markus Milne"

A mixed methods approach is taken in this research. This thesis first identifies important flagship visual merchandising elements used in high-end fashion flagship stores; this data is collected by way of interviews with industry experts. To examine possible effects of store type and contextual visual merchandising on shopper response, an online experiment using the identified visual merchandising practices is conducted adopting a 2x2x2 between-subjects factorial design. In the experiment participants were exposed to one of eight different conditions involving the combination of the three variables (store type, signage type and visual display level). A total of 228 responses were included in final analyses, with participants being recruited through online convenience sampling on Facebook. Factorial ANCOVA analysis was conducted to test the hypothesised effects. The results indicated there were no interaction effects of store type and visual merchandising on shopper response. Some main effects were present, with results indicating branded signage had a positive effect on the browsing intentions and purchase intentions of shoppers, as well as a positive effect on how shoppers perceive a stores overall image.

The employment of the SLO term has since become heavily embedded within Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) and related reporting practices across a variety of sectors and in different jurisdictions, becoming part of business and policy discourse, with respect to corporate environmental and social responbility. While the notion of SLO is used in a variety of sectors, the majority of the academic literature on SLO is from Australia or North America. In addition, little inter-industry comparisons have been conducted with single industry studies, and particular of mining and energy, being dominant. Therefore, this thesis investigates how SLO is represented and utilised in the New Zealand business context.

This thesis has two main components. First, a review and discussion of the SLO literature is presented, using both a thematic and systematic literature review. Second, a content analysis was conducted on the annual reports, sustainability reports and online content of all 65 members of the New Zealand Sustainable Business Council (NZSBC), in order to determine how New Zealand companies operationalise the SLO concept. The NZSBC was chosen for this research due to the council being a platform for collaboration on sustainable business practice, including having released a report on the value of SLO to business. The content analysis examined the environmental, non-environmental and engagement attributes of SLO identified in the literature review.

Although only four NZSBC members explicitly used the term SLO the attributes of SLO were identified as being present to varying degrees in the media provided by members. Significantly, the sectors in which these attributes and usage occurred were substantially different from those identified in the international literature. The thesis concludes by drawing attention to the managerial and theoretical contributions of the study and provides suggestions for further avenues of SLO research.",,,,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/13541",,"en","English",,"University of Canterbury",,,,,"http://library.canterbury.ac.nz/thesis/etheses_copyright.shtml",,"All Rights Reserved",,,,,,,,,,,"How is a social licence represented in the context of New Zealand?",,,"Electronic Thesis or Dissertation",,"Business Administration",,,"University of Canterbury",,"Masters",,,"Master of Commerce",,"2486646",,,"College of Business and Law, University of Canterbury",,,"hele.power@gmail.com",,,,,,,,"Sussie Morrish"

It appears that misbehaving consumers are adopting anti-social mechanisms which are exhibited through many different manifestations, suggesting the magnitude of the issue poses a threat for the safety and well-being of many consumers online. The lack of academic and general understanding of the phenomenon of anti-social behaviours online, specifically how they appear, but also why these consumers behave the way they do, significantly limits the effectiveness in addressing such behaviours. Therefore, this research will explore the many appearances of anti-social behaviour in an online context. The primary aim of this research is to understand how anti-social behaviour is manifested and secondarily, understand the individual factors that act as motivations for consumers expressing anti-social behaviour online. Taking an exploratory approach and using a qualitative research strategy, this research will consider anti-social behaviour on three popular SNSs; Twitter, Facebook and Reddit, and these will be examined through a content analysis and follow-up focus group. The key singular contribution of this research stems from creating a better understanding of anti-social behaviours online, and the drivers and motivations prompting engagement. This understanding will contribute to existing consumer research literature, enhancing the knowledge about consumer misbehaviours online.

"16271","10092/839","Ishaq, Maryam",,,,,,,"2016",,"This dissertation deals with the economics of equilibrium real exchange rates in the context of Balassa-Samuelson hypothesis. For developing economies of East and South Asia (ASEAN and SAARC), trend deviations in real exchange rate from long-run PPP are tested against their biased sectoral productivity patterns, under the theoretical predictions of Balassa-Samuelson model. The thesis undertakes a study of three inter-related dimensions of productivity-real exchange rate linkage: (a) identification of productivity as a key determinant of permanent deviations in real exchange rate from long-run PPP, (b) validity of hypothesis under alternative theoretical specifications, and (c) inclusion of demand-side shocks to see if this can buy any support for the proposed model.

The novelty of this study lies with the careful theoretical as well as empirical examination, conducted to verify the long-run association between sectoral productivity real exchange rate movements. To assess the robustness of results, distinction between traded and non-traded sectors of the real economy is made in a more definitive manner. Data inconsistencies across sectors as well as across countries in the form of uncommon data sources, inconsistent scheme of sectoral division and inadequately disaggregated sectors are addressed to ensure data reliability. Furthermore, two alternative schemes of sectoral classification are employed to examine the sensitivity of model estimates. Three alternative measures of real exchange rate are used, that dominantly comprise of nontradables prices, so that the internal mechanism of the Balassa- Samuelson model could be captured appropriately. Three alternative theoretical specifications of the Balassa-Samuelson model are tested, ranging from the most restrictive domestic version of the model to the modified version, allowing for deviations in tradables prices from long-run PPP. The proposed model is also tested for its augmented version, by including a two demand-side determinants of real exchange rate, largely advocated in literature. Finally, various time-series and pooled data econometric techniques are applied for empirical verification, ranging from single equation to multivariate cointegration approaches, to test the consistency and robustness of estimates.

The results suggest that inter-country divergent sectoral productivity patterns do not exert any significant effect on the long-run real exchange rates for the ASEAN and SAARC countries in my sample, as predicted by Balassa (1964) and Samuelson (1964). The argument of the Balassa- Samuelson hypothesis that biased relative productivity of tradables at home will influence the overall price level of the country through nontraded sector prices and contribute to the long-run movements of real exchange rates does not hold valid. My findings are highly robust and successfully survived alternative sectoral classifications, different variants of real exchange rate measures, alternative theoretical specifications of the model and different econometric techniques. Empirical results for the standard (international) version of the hypothesis reveal that relative sectoral productivity differences across countries are inadequate in explaining the trend departures in the real exchange rates away from their long-run equilibrium. However, the Balassa-Samuelson hypothesis is more convincingly rejected when the domestic version of the model is tested. The results remain unchanged when the assumption of PPP, inherent to international Balassa- Samuelson model, is relaxed in favor of inter-country traded sector prices. This modified version of the model, allowing for trend deviations in international tradable prices from its PPP value, does not yield sizeable support, in favor of Balassa-Samuelson hypothesis for the sample countries. Furthermore, the empirical results reveal a clear departure of tradable prices from   the long-run PPP, suggesting that this divergence is a potential reason for the non-existence of the Balassa-Samuelson effect. Finally, two demand-side factors, i.e., GDP per capita and government consumption spending, are augmented into Balassa-Samuelson model. However, their representation in the Balassa-Samuelson could gain only marginal support for the proposed productivity-real exchange rate relationship.

On the whole, I tend to reject the Balassa-Samuelson effect for emerging Asian countries due to inadequate empirical evidence in support of the hypothesis. Irrespective of alternative sectoral divisions, real exchange rate measures, model specifications or estimation procedures, sectoral productivity patterns are rarely found to cause significant real exchange rate appreciation in long-run for Asia.",,,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/13545",,,"en","English",,"University of Canterbury",,,,,"http://library.canterbury.ac.nz/thesis/etheses_copyright.shtml",,"All Rights Reserved",,,,,,,,,,,"Productivity-real exchange rate nexus : revisiting the Balassa-Samuelson hypothesis for emerging Asia.",,,"Electronic Thesis or Dissertation",,,"Economics",,"University of Canterbury",,"Doctoral",,,"Doctor of Philosophy",,"2486682",,,"College of Business and Law, University of Canterbury",,,"ucresearchrepository@canterbury.ac.nz",,,,,,,,"Prof. William Robert Reed"

"16128","10092/839","Hawkins, Tess E.",,,,,,,"2017",,"This thesis aims to investigate the different motivations of fitness technology users. Specifically, this thesis examines technology-based fitness experiences and the motivations and value that users derive from these experiences. Three literature streams are used to explain user engagement in technology-based fitness experiences: experience marketing, co-creation and gamification. In order to understand user motivations and the value derived from using this type of technology, an online survey was created using Qualtrics and a sample was recruited through Mechanical Turk. The scales used in the survey were sourced and adapted from the co-creation and gamification literature streams. A total of 360 responses were collected, and statistically analysed using multivariate procedures, including factor analysis and cluster analysis. On the basis of this analysis, users were put into distinct groups and profiled.

The results revealed that functional, social and emotional value are significant sources of motivation for engaging in technology-based fitness experiences. It was also found that gamification is a significant area of value for users and, therefore, is as an important consideration for fitness app designers. The most relevant and influential constructs, in relation to technology-based fitness experiences and product usage co-creation, were also identified. These include the risk and accessibility components of the DART framework and the four factors of the mobile Internet experience. In contrast, personalisation and flow were identified as unimportant to users. It was found that users predominantly utilise fitness apps to help meet their need to achieve fitness and health related goals. However, it was also identified that the gamification aspects of fitness apps are highly valued by users. This study demonstrates that fitness app designers must endeavour to make their apps functional and entertaining as it will likely elicit user adoption.",,,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/13425",,,"en","English",,"University of Canterbury",,,,,"http://library.canterbury.ac.nz/thesis/etheses_copyright.shtml",,"All Rights Reserved",,,,,,,,,,,"The co-creation of gamified fitness experiences",,,"Electronic Thesis or Dissertation",,,"Business Administration",,"University of Canterbury",,"Masters",,,"Master of Commerce",,"2470459",,,"College of Business and Law, University of Canterbury",,,"tess@hawkins.net.nz",,,,,,,,"Professor Paul Ballantine"
"19249","10092/839","Zhu, Xiuxuan",,,,,,,"2018",,"As a society, there is a growing trend towards health wellness and proactive health behaviours, one fundamental health behaviours is health information seeking. In the recent years, individuals have increasingly turned to health information seeking through an online system over other channels of information (Tu, 2011). The potential impact and value of online health information has also been recognised by researchers, health professionals, and public and private organisations across the world (Goldzweig et al., 2013). In 2017, more than $1.5 billion was invested in online health information initiatives in the US (Jain et al., 2017), and in New Zealand, the health information website, Health Navigator New Zealand, received nationwide support and funding from 16 district health boards. However, many of these online health initiatives have not experienced the expected uptake from consumers, and these initiatives are costly for the online system providers. Therefore it is important to understand the factors that influence individuals’ intentions to seek health information using online systems.

Some studies have adapted established theory to explain intentions towards online health information seeking, while other studies have focused on exploring salient factors, many of which are vastly different to those modelled in established theory. However, few studies have provided a comprehensive model combining these factors together, and in particular, little attention has been given to incorporating information- and system-related factors from the technological environment. This study aims to address this gap in the current understanding of online health information seeking, by focusing on the information and system factors that influence intentions to seek health information online. To achieve this, the literature was reviewed and a theoretical model was developed from key concepts and theories (Theory of Planned Behaviour (Ajzen, 1991), Technology Acceptance Model (Davis, 1989) and Wixom and Todd’s (2005) User Satisfaction and Technology Acceptance Model), which included information quality, system quality, source credibility, information satisfaction, system satisfaction, perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, attitude, self-efficacy, social influence, past use, and intentions. Hypotheses were developed to understand the importance and impact of each model construct, and the data collected from health information seekers in New Zealand was analysed using Partial Least Squares Path Modeling. The results of the analysis showed support for the integration of information- and system-related factors in understanding intentions to seek health information using online systems and provided a broad view of online health information seeking intentions from both social psychology and information systems perspectives. This incorporation and emphasis of information- and system-related factors can inform online health information system providers to design, develop, and improve their systems to target the specific factors important to online health information seekers.",,,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/15585",,,"en","English",,"University of Canterbury",,,,,"http://library.canterbury.ac.nz/thesis/etheses_copyright.shtml",,"All Rights Reserved",,,,,,,,,,,"Predicting intentions to seek health information online : an integrated model.",,,"Electronic Thesis or Dissertation",,,"Accountancy",,"University of Canterbury",,"Masters",,,"Master of Commerce",,,,,"College of Business and Law, University of Canterbury",,,"Xiuxuan.zhu@icloud.com",,,,,,,,"Associate Professor Annette Mills"
"17543","10092/839","Thomson, Andrea Marcial",,,,,,,"2017",,"Purpose- To better understand what motivates employees to vent on the social media platform
Facebook about work and why Facebook is selected by employees as a platform to vent.

Methodology- This study used phenomenological interviews to investigate instances where employees 
had vented about work on Facebook. 10 Generation-Y participants were interviewed using 
semi-structured, convergent and open-ended interviewing techniques, and asked to recall the 
circumstances surrounding their respective Facebook posts. Generation-Y participants were selected 
as they make up one of the largest Facebook user groups. The data was analysed using thematic 
analysis and a conceptual framework derived from the findings was presented and
discussed.

Findings- The findings of this research indicate that the phenomenon of work-related venting on 
Facebook is far more complex than simply an impulsive manifestation of an individual’s stress or 
frustration. Venting was used as an emotion-focused coping strategy and a response to feelings of 
marginalisation and voice minimisation within the organisation. Participants’ primary motivation 
for venting on Facebook was not to disparage their employer, but instead to utilize Facebook as a 
platform for communicating with peers and accessing social support. The participants felt their 
concerns were treated as insignificant and the lack of in-organisations processes to express voice 
or access support structures encouraged them to exert voice and seek support from outside of the 
workplace. Facebook was used to obtain additional social support from a community of known 
individuals. Facebook’s high membership rate  also allowed participants to communicate with a large 
number and wide range of peers simultaneously, giving access to a larger network of social support 
as well as overcoming space and time challenges associated with face-to-face venting. This thesis 
argues that venting about work on Facebook facilitates access to social support outside of the work 
setting, which serves as an extension of traditional workplace coping strategies. The findings do 
not help determine if work-related venting on Facebook is an effective method of coping, due to the 
differential outcomes observed by participants. However, it has provided key insights to the 
complex mechanisms that comprise the phenomenon.

Implications- This research highlights that venting on Facebook has been used as a way to cope with 
work-related stressors such as feelings of marginalisation and voice minimisation. Social media 
policies that aim to restrict employee voice online are unlikely to remove the impetus to vent on 
social media platforms  such  as  Facebook. This  research  highlights  the need to  revisit
these policies. For example, acknowledging the importance of social media as a way to access 
social support whilst also  encouraging and allowing constructive venting to  take place    within
the organisation. Organisations may wish to consider allowing employees to vent on Facebook 
provided that the organisation is not identifiable. Furthermore, organisations may wish to consider 
creating in-organisation processes that aim to prevent employee feelings of marginalisation and 
voice minimisation, which in theory should subsequently reduce the impetus to vent outside of work. 
Venting on Facebook was demonstrated as beneficial in some circumstances but not in others. In 
instances where venting allowed participants to access necessary social support and allowed 
negative emotions to be extinguished, it was considered a beneficial outcome. Venting was also 
demonstrated as detrimental when it encouraged the participant to continue to ruminate about their 
circumstances and contributed to ongoing stress
and frustration.

There also became an increasing awareness of the importance of employee-focused HRM, resulting in a changed outlook for some practitioners. The post-disaster period provided a potential learning experience for practitioners, along with an opportunity for practitioners to introduce new initiatives.

"13152","10092/839",,"Prendergast-Tarena, Eruera Ropata",,,,,"2015",,"Indigenous organisations are key sites of collective identity, voice, and empowerment yet we know virtually nothing about their nature or what makes them different. This thesis seeks to address this gap by answering the overarching question: ‘What are the features of current indigenous organisation design and how are organisational elements and definitions of success influenced by culture?’ The distinct contribution of this thesis is its unique blend, using indigenous theory and organisation theory, to generate new and original indigenous organisation theory.

This thesis uses a multiple case study design focused on three contemporary indigenous organisations, Kamehameha Schools of Hawai’i, the Sealaska Regional Corporation of Alaska and Te Rūnanga o Ngāi Tahu of New Zealand to investigate the phenomenon of contemporary indigenous organisations. A total of 90 interviews were analysed for this inductive qualitative study that uses grounded theory methods.

Conflict is an inherent dynamic in indigenous organisations. This thesis suggests the adoption of Western structural models has benefitted indigenous economic development, but these structures are a source of tension as they are not aligned with indigenous purposes and contribute to fears of cultural assimilation. Structure is both a source of tension and the scapegoat for broader tensions stemming from the conflicting purposes, mindsets, and cultural contexts to which the organisation must relate. Indigenous organisations are complex and conflicted as they seek to balance opposing demands, striving to keep pace with a fast- changing environment, whilst simultaneously trying to be more consistent with their own cultural values.

Despite these challenges, change is occurring. This thesis suggests indigenous organisations are evolving to better align with indigenous cultural values and aspirations. Tensions also signal progress as taken for granted assumptions are identified, challenged, and replaced. This thesis shows that organisations and their design are not culturally neutral. Furthermore, indigenous organisations are progressing towards the possibility of indigenous models of organisation that offers a way out of the constraints of their present realities.",,,,,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/11385","en",,,"University of Canterbury.

Many panel data estimators are incorporated in econometric packages, readily available to researchers. They use different assumptions to address different aspects of dependencies in the errors, with implications for the accuracy with which both the coefficient and its variance-covariance matrix are estimated. Researchers find themselves confronted with difficulty when choosing specific estimators that best suit the data they are modelling, since no clear guidance exists to facilitate this choice. Reed and Ye (2011) attempted to provide such guidelines. After conducting Monte Carlo experiments on 11 linear static panel data estimators, they proposed a set of recommendations to be used by other researchers. In this Thesis, we first replicate their results after addressing a flaw identified in their experimental design. We improve the formulation of the original recommendations and show that the new recommendations are robust to the errors’ parameters. We further use bootstrap techniques to investigate the Parks (1967) estimator, which is most efficient for certain-sized data sets, but which also has poor test size performance. The bootstrap techniques effectively remove the size distortion related to this estimator. Lessons from these two chapters are then used to model the contribution of health and education spending to economic growth in a sample of 12 African countries observed from 1999 to 2013.

"16416","10092/839",,"Lum, Foo-Hong, Philip",,,,,,"2017",,"This thesis submits its conceptual opportunity-outcome-process (O-O-P) framework to complement and operationalize the dualistic individual-opportunity (IO) nexus notion (Venkataraman, 1997) as an integrated theory of startup entrepreneurship. Person-centric research has hitherto failed to explain the entrepreneurial phenomenon, while opportunity-oriented studies are “elusive” (Dimov, 2011) and fragmented by the Western ‘either/or’ views of objectivists and subjectivists regarding opportunity’s ontology. Hence, the IO-nexus notion has been handicapped in delivering the “promise of entrepreneurship as a field of research” (Shane & Venkataraman, 2000) based on the interaction between entrepreneur and opportunity.

To advance the IO-nexus notion in entrepreneurship research, the O-O-P framework reframes, ‘defragments,’ and integrates the received Western dialectic views with the ‘both/and’ logic of the Chinese yin-yang duality notion as the alternate metatheory on opportunity. Opportunity’s ontological nature is thus rationalized as a dualistic nexus with the interacting forces of demand and supply alternating as either the ‘source’ or ‘root-origin’ (also the isomorphic outcome or ‘ends’) of opportunity, or the instrumental-means to fulfill the opportunity. The opportunity-hexadecadrant is introduced to visualize opportunities as dualistic demand and supply nexuses under different yin-yang market-settings. It also operationalizes the IO-nexus by helping to deduce the special role of opportunity’s root-origin in defining on an a priori basis the essential aspects of starting up: the types of opportunity (with their respective risk-uncertainty profiles and level of entrepreneurial and innovative effort involved), outcomes, orientations, entrepreneurial process, and antecedent-ends-means linkages. Applying the yin-yang Taijitu, the thesis identifies a fourth epistemology–regression–to complement extant positivist-realist, constructionist, and evolutionary-realist discourses on the formation and exploitation of eight types of opportunities.

Qualitative multiple-holistic case studies reveal literal and theoretical replications generalizable analytically to the O-O-P framework’s propositions: opportunities are dualistic nexuses of demand-supply or supply-demand configurations in different yin-yang market-settings, and have a priori outcomes that determine their interactions with the individual in the dualistic IO-nexus. This sets forth the O-O-P framework and the dualistic IO-nexus notion as a single integrated a priori theory to fulfill entrepreneurship as “a distinctive domain” (Venkataraman, 1997, p. 123).",,,,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/13625",,"en","English",,"University of Canterbury",,,,,"http://library.canterbury.ac.nz/thesis/etheses_copyright.shtml",,"All Right Reserved",,,,,,,,,,,"Promise fulfilled?: a yin-yang opportunity-outcome-process (O-O-P) framework for the individual-opportunity (IO) nexus.",,,"Electronic Thesis or Dissertation",,,"Business Administration",,"University of Canterbury",,"Doctoral",,,"Doctor of Philosophy",,,"2532371",,"College of Business and Law, University of Canterbury",,,"6 Wye Oak Drive, Schnapper Rock, Auckland 0632",,,,,,,,"Associate Professor Sussie Morrish"

"10160","10092/839",,,"Welschen, Judith Elisabeth",,,,,"2014",,"A major challenge for knowledge management concerns motivating people to share their knowledge with others. Many companies address this challenge by implementing sophisticated knowledge management systems. However, despite investments in knowledge management systems and practices, significant failure rates are being reported. Studies show that an important reason for this is that people are often reluctant to share their personal knowledge. It is therefore key for companies to understand the factors that influence employee attitudes toward knowledge sharing. Previous research on motivation has attempted to understand employee attitudes, intentions and behavior in relation to organizational knowledge sharing. However, few studies have provided a comprehensive model that includes a key set of extrinsic and intrinsic motivators for knowledge sharing, such as self-efficacy, meaningfulness, impact, tangible rewards, verbal rewards, anticipated reciprocal benefits and reputation and examined their relationship with knowledge sharing attitude and intention. The objective of this research is to fill that gap by investigating how the salient intrinsic and extrinsic motivators influence knowledge sharing attitude and intention. From an extensive review of the literature, a research model was proposed and hypotheses were developed to explore the answers to the research questions. Data was collected through a survey in organizations in New Zealand and Partial Least Squares Path Modeling was used to analyze the data. Empirical results showed intention to share knowledge was determined by attitude towards knowledge sharing and self-efficacy, meaningfulness, anticipated reciprocal relationships and reputation had a significant impact on the attitude towards knowledge sharing. This research contributes to the knowledge sharing literature by providing a comprehensive model of knowledge sharing motivators, including motivators that have been largely ignored in prior studies, and by empirically examining the influence of the key intrinsic and extrinsic motivators on attitude towards knowledge sharing. Furthermore, this research benefits companies that are using or setting up knowledge management systems and practices by allowing them to better understand how to encourage employees to engage in knowledge sharing.",,,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/9214",,,"en",,,"University of Canterbury.

Improving employee wellbeing is therefore of significant importance for organisational performance. This study draws on the Job Demands-Resources model which suggests that the balance between job demands and resources impacts on individual well-being. Using an on-line survey (N=162) this study investigated the direct and indirect relationships between job demands, engagement and drive on work-life conflict and well-being. In general, the findings of this study are consistent with the JD-R model; job demands predicted work-life conflict, while the strongest predictor of well-being was the job resource of work engagement. Further, once indirect relationships were considered, it was found that engagement, a construct generally associated with positive outcomes, and overtime hours lead to psychological detachment issues for employees; consequently contributing to their work-life conflict. In addition, work-life conflict was found to mediate the relationships between the job demands of external work pressures and drive and wellbeing, suggesting that being pressured to put one’s work before their other interests and having an excessive work-drive contribute to reduced employee well-being. The unique contribution of this study lies in the assertion that while engagement has positive influence on employee and organisational outcomes, it is important that organisations and individuals ensure that work does not cause a negative spillover into employees’ private life, enabling them to recover after work and be ready for the next day’s challenges.

In order to provide a broad perspective on New Zealand’s local innovation processes, a mixed method approach combining both quantitative and qualitative analysis was adopted to allow analysis of both empirical data and case study data. The quantitative part of analysis utilises the unique dataset developed by Statistics New Zealand, namely the prototype Longitudinal Business Database (LBD), and the qualitative analysis includes four in-depth company case studies which complement the regression analyses by uncovering the key patterns of innovation behaviour at the firm level. In summary, a number of conclusions have been drawn from the research. Firstly, firms experience considerably smaller positive size effect because of New Zealand’s unique firm demographics, and the small size has limited individual firm’s innovation opportunities. Secondly, firms’ ability to develop new technologies directly influences their innovative ability, which is highly dependent on the availability of funds and skills.

Concerns raised in the accounting profession regarding the susceptibility of the cash flow statement to manipulation, coupled with the recent introduction of NZ IAS 7 (cash flow statement) provide the motivation for investigating the potential for miscommunication (either intentional or unintentional) between the main parties to the financial reporting process.  The study investigates inter and intra group differences in measured connotative meaning of the old and new definitions of “cash”, and determines the effect of connotative meaning on decision outcomes.  Further, the study considers the overall quality of the two definitions, as perceived by the three financial reporting groups. 

Three key findings are indicated.  The first is that the three financial reporting groups do not share the same cognitive structure in which the meaning of the concept “cash” is held.  An important implication is that comparisons between the connotative meanings held by the three financial reporting groups cannot be validly made.  Secondly, significant differences in the measured meaning were observed across the two definitions within each of the three subject groups.  Thirdly, the decision outcomes for each of the three subject groups were significantly different under the two definitions.  Also there was some evidence that the differences in the decision outcomes were linked to the differences in the measured connotative meaning.

These results raised several concerns regarding the potential for miscommunication between the three key parties to the accounting communication process and highlighted the importance of standard-setters assessing the effect on connotative meaning of possible changes in wording to key concepts within the cash flow statement.",,,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/1940",,,"en",,,"University of Canterbury.

"4804","10092/839",,,"Chetty, Kamala (Sylvie)",,,,,"1993",,"This thesis attempts to establish the key factors influencing trade performance at both industry and enterprise-level. The underlying purpose is to consolidate the diverse literature in International Marketing as well as provide new insights. For the industry-level study, trade performance models are developed and tested to explain changes in exports and imports for a cross-section of New Zealand manufacturing industries between 1985 and 1990. Increased exports are associated with larger firm sizes, lower levels of advertising intensity and least trade protection (by either tariff or export subsidy). The largest increases in imports have been in those industries which are relatively highly concentrated, with higher R&D intensities, and higher levels of tariff protection and foreign ownership. The key to raising the export performance of manufacturing in general, seems to lie with increasing the quantity and improving the quality of product-related R&D carried out in New Zealand.
 
 A meta-analysis of 111 studies on export performance conducted during the period 1978-1991 was done to identify the key variables at enterprise-level. A multi-case study of 12 small to medium-sized firms, six from the timber processing industry and six from the electrical industrial machinery industry, was conducted to gather data for this section. The key variables identified in the meta-analysis are confirmed. The findings show that firm size drives export growth at both industry and enterprise-level. The study provides new insights on how the export behaviour process operates. Enterprises in both industries behave in a similar manner but there are significant differences in the behaviour between exporters and non-exporters. There is considerable overlap within export strategies among the group of eight exporters thus ruling out export strategy as an explanation for export performance.",,,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/4321",,,"en",,,"University of Canterbury.

strategy in order to maximise performance (Dent, 1990). Prior research has focused narrowly
on this premise (Fisher, 1995). The existing research has concentrated on only one aspect of
business strategy; either typology, position, or mission (Langfield-Smith, 1997). Also,
structure has been investigated only in terms of management control systems, such as
budgeting, and performance evaluation (Langfield-Smith, 1997). To overcome these
limitations case study research should describe the wider organisational context of strategy,
structure, and performance (Fisher, 1995; Otley and Pollanen, 2000). Therefore, this thesis
describes Farmlands Trading Society's entire strategy, structure, and financial performance.
It was found that Farmlands' corporate strategy is customer and profitability driven. Its
business strategy is derived from these aspects. Typology, position, and mission have been
tailored towards each of Farmlands' four customer groups. Operational strategy delivers the
corporate and business goals. Farmlands matches its strategy to customer objectives and
behaviour. To achieve a match, its structure is used to determine the appropriate strategy,
monitor the strategy, and respond to change in customers. Controls in Farmlands are tight,
and employees participate in determining goals and budgets. Leadership from the Chief
Executive ensures managers and employees communicate with each other so that customer
objectives are meet. Linking customers, strategy, and structure in the manner described has
been successful, as financial performance has improved significantly over time.",,,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/2710",,,"en",,,"University of Canterbury.

"3106","10092/839",,,"Wong, Yoon San",,,,,"1994",,"Over the last decade the market-driven economic philosophies of successive
New Zealand governments have transformed the structure of the economy. These
changes have established favourable market conditions for the success of a particular
type of anticompetitive organisational behaviour, predatory pricing. From the mid1950s
to the early 1980s, economic analyses of predatory pricing theories frequently
concluded that this behaviour constituted economically irrational behaviour. This
conclusion generated a widespread scepticism among antitrust commentators, policymakers
and judges towards the prevalence of such behaviour. Recently, however, the
basis for this conclusion has been undermined by the application of Game Theory to
predatory pricing. Game-theoretic analysis has proven that predatory pricing is rational
under a range of market conditions and consequently, issues regarding the need for
prohibition and the optimal method of proscription have again become relevant.
This research investigates the contemporary developments in economic and
judicial analysis of predatory pricing in order to evaluate the efficacy of section 36 of
the Commerce Act 1986 in prohibiting this behaviour. A comprehensive survey of the
game-theoretic predatory pricing models concludes that these models refute a number
of well-known irrationality arguments and that predatory pricing cannot be regarded as
irrational organisational behaviour. Prominent standards proposed in the literature for
the existence of predatory pricing are then shown to be deficient in light of the insights
provided by the application of game theory. A critique of the most recent predatory
pricing cases decided by the United States Supreme Court, the Court of Justice of the
European Economic Community and the Australian Full Federal Court is then
conducted and it is found that the form and content of the standard for any jurisdiction
must be dictated by the specific objectives of the competition law legislation. Finally,
the research concludes that, in all but one respect, the current drafting and judicial
interpretation of section 36 enables the section to be effective in proscribing those types
of predatory pricing which are inimical to the attainment of the objectives of the
Commerce Act.",,,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/2719",,,"en",,,"University of Canterbury.

Twenty one years later, Andrew McRobert and Ronnie Hoffman provided an update of Argenti's work for the 1990s. Their cumulative work involved a failure model and the failure trajectory theory (trajectory analysis). The failure model examines the defects, mistakes and symptoms that companies exhibit as they near failure. In contrast, trajectory analysis proposes three different pathways that companies can follow when they fail. Additionally because of the particulars of each pathway, trajectory analysis should have considerable value in company failure classification. However, the limited examination of trajectory analysis provides considerable scope for further research into their propositions. This thesis provides an examination of trajectory analysis. The examination involves firstly, an evaluation of the theory and discusses any deficiencies in trajectory analysis. Secondly, it produces a trajectory for a New Zealand case study: Air New Zealand Limited. Air New Zealand is a large important New Zealand company that could have failed in 2001 if not for the intervention of the New Zealand Government. Thus the case study chosen is a timely example of a large company collapse. Finally, the thesis determines the extent to which trajectory analysis is a failure classification model. The results show that it is possible to create a trajectory that generally follows Air New Zealand's financial performance over time. However, in this particular case, it seems that trajectory analysis is not a failure classification model, but instead has potential as an early warning system to prevent failure.",,,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/3188",,,"en",,,"University of Canterbury.

For both parts, I divide the sample period into two sub-sample periods – the pre-OCR period and the OCR period.  
Using Mankiw & Miron’s (1986) approach for testing the expectations hypothesis, the findings in this paper suggest that the theory is consistent with New Zealand data during the OCR period. I attribute the success of the theory to the introduction of the Official Cash Rate system in March 1999. The change from targeting the settlement cash balance to targeting an interest rate variable has substantially improved the predictability of short-term interest rates. 
In regards to the predictive power of the spread, the findings in this paper support the conventional view that the spread is positively related to future economic activity. Using Hamilton & Kim’s (2002) approach, I decomposed the term spread into an expectation component and a term premium in an attempt to find out whether these two variables have distinctly separate effect on future economic activity. My findings are in contrast to that reported by Hamilton & Kim. In particular, I find that the term premium in some cases is significant and negatively related to future economic activity in New Zealand.

"10388","10092/839",,,"Hamid, Suhaila Abdul",,,,,"2014",,"Tax agents have important roles in tax systems as both advocates for their clients and intermediaries for the tax authorities. The roles of tax agents are becoming more challenging with the changes in the tax landscape, such as with the implementation of the self-assessment systems (SAS) which transfers more responsibility to taxpayers to comply with their tax obligations and who in turn, rely on tax agents to comply with the tax laws. This study examined some selected factors in understanding the tax agents’ tax compliance behaviour by extending the Theory of Planned Behaviour, by including two additional factors namely, ethical sensitivity and culture. 
Conducted in the tax jurisdictions of Malaysia and New Zealand, this study is comparative in nature. To understand the tax compliance behaviour of tax agents in this study, a mixed-method approach, combining surveys and semi-structured telephone interviews, was used. In Malaysia, the survey data were collected using a mail survey from a sample of tax agents in public practice whose names were listed on the website of the Malaysian Inland Revenue Board. Online surveys were used to collect responses from a sample of members of the New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants (NZICA) whose names were listed as public practitioners on NZICA’s website. Descriptive statistics and Partial Least Squares (PLS), a structural equation modeling (SEM) technique, were used to describe and analyze the quantitative data. Transcribing, coding, finding the relevant themes and member checking were used to analyze the qualitative data of the study.
Basically, the results indicate some similarities and some differences between tax agents’ compliance behaviour in Malaysia and New Zealand. Consistent with findings from prior studies, the results suggest that attitude towards intention to comply with the tax law was the most influential factor in explaining tax agents’ compliance behaviour to tax law in Malaysia and New Zealand in both scenarios of overstating tax expenses and understating income examined in the study. This was followed by ethical sensitivity, which was measured using Rest’s (1986) Multidimensional Ethics Scale (MES), as the second influential factor in tax agents’ compliance behaviour to tax law. Mixed findings were recorded for culture which was measured using Hofstede’s (1980) National Cultural Dimensions and perceived behavioural control. No support, however, was found for subjective norms in the study. 
The findings from the survey were elaborated further in the interviews. The interviews with seventeen tax agents in Malaysia and fourteen tax agents from New Zealand provide some interesting findings.  While the results of the survey indicate that attitude was found to be the most important factor in tax agents’ tax compliance behaviour, the interview findings clarified how tax agents understand attitude. For instance, attitude was interpreted as not only complying with the professional code of ethics, but also, fear towards being penalized, audited and interestingly, fear towards obtaining a bad reputation among the public and peers. 
Overall, the findings suggest that noneconomic factors, such as attitudes and ethical sensitivity, can explain the tax compliance behaviour of tax agents in the study. Some economic factors identified for example, amount of risk involved, the trade-off between costs and benefits, and the probability of being penalized, from the interviews could also potentially explain the tax compliance behaviour of  the tax agents in Malaysia and New Zealand who participated in the study. 
The findings contribute to the theoretical and practical aspects of understanding the tax compliance behaviour of tax agents in two different countries. In a response to the calls for more cross-cultural research, this study reveals some similarities and differences in the tax compliance behaviour of tax agents in Malaysia and New Zealand which may be helpful in improving our understanding of the ethical decision making of tax agents. The findings from the study also provide some insights into the ethical behaviour of tax agents in Malaysia and New Zealand which may be useful for professional bodies and regulators.",,,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/9426",,,"en",,,"University of Canterbury.

Using health-service delivery data, workforce data, and DHB monthly financial information, I estimate the DHB Provider Arm economic production process and the interaction between DHBs and the health-sector labour and capital input markets.

Production and input market interactions are modelled through simultaneously estimating a DHB production function together with the first order conditions for cost-minimisation in an econometric system-of-equations.  Estimating a system-of-equations allows labour and capital market prices to interact with DHB marginal input productivities according to the first order conditions of cost-minimisation. Nationally-determined MECA labour prices influence health service output through their equality to DHB production-based input marginal productivities.  

Medical and nursing labour appears to have inelastic labour demand, providing scope for unions in those sectors to exploit market power.  DHBs are employing fewer workers than they would and paying more for each worker than they should if the labour market was more competitive.  New Zealanders are receiving less health care then they might, and experiencing more morbidity then they need bear, from the workforce restrictions generated in the health sector's labour market.  The passed-through inflated labour costs are borne by taxpayers, who lack options for alternative provider care.

The non-competitive labour market induce secondary labour market effects.  Overseas-trained medical labour, attracted into New Zealand by above-competition wages, are denied employment within medical-skill-hungry DHBs.  Graduate nurses over-supply a quantity-constrained labour market, generated entrenched unemployment.  DHBs are induced to be allocative and technically inefficient through price distortions, creating higher output costs and an inefficient production input mix.",,,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/9831",,,"en",,,"University of Canterbury.

traditionally dominated by nation states and the use of military coercion. Because of
its uniqueness, academics have sought new theories in order to understand it. This
thesis draws on two of these theories in order to gain an understanding about the
driving force behind the proposed European External Action Service (EEAS); the socalled
‘expectations-capabilities gap’ and Normative Power Europe (NPE). The
former is agency-centred and draws on understandings about the capability of the EU
as an international actor and the impact of both internal and external expectations
placed on it, that it does not necessarily have the means to live up to. The latter theory
–NPE- is identity centred, and concerns how the EU is understood with a focus on
norms and values which it wishes to export to the rest of the world. One of the
connecting themes of the two theories is a stress on the need to have effective
communication.
Using both a qualitative and quantitative methodology, this thesis aims to understand
how the EU is currently represented in the Asia-Pacific and the potential of the EEAS
to improve this representation. Ultimately, there are three findings for this thesis.
Firstly, how the EU sees itself and its role in the world does not necessarily correlate
with outsiders’ perceptions of it. Secondly, part of the confusion and ineffectiveness
of the EU to be recognised could be directly related to its confusing multirepresentation
in third countries. Finally, the EEAS has the ability to greatly improve
the way the EU operates and communicates, thus potentially narrowing the
‘expectations-capabilities gap’ as well as improving the capability of the EU to be a
normative power. However, the vagueness of the EEAS proposals means that steps
must be taken to ensure that the EEAS is supported by the other EU actors who will
be affected by the new system, as well as ensuring that the proposals are effective in
carrying out the goals that it has set out to achieve. This is important if the EU aims to
be taken more seriously as an international actor and is to be a force for good in the
world. However, caution must be taken against building up the expectations placed on
the EEAS too much – history demonstrates that it would be foolish to market the
EEAS as a panacea for all of the EU’s problems.",,,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/3625",,,"en",,,"University of Canterbury.

dependent elderly in private and public hospital and in the

compare the costs between modes of care, the estimates
obtained were variable costs, related to patient dependency,
and represented the cost of all resources provided, including
informal care.
Using weighted least squares estimation, models were
developed relating the consumption of direct nursing care in
hospital to patient disabilities. These models explained a
substantial proportion of the variability of the consumption
of this resource.
Nursing care was identified as the major determinant of
the variation between patients in the cost of hospital care.
Estimates of cost for individual patients in public and
private hospital were obtained as functions of the direct
nursing car~ consumed, and were found to vary substantially
between patients in each type of hospital.
The costs of public and private hospital care were
compared, using the nursing care models to correct for the
lower average dependency of the private hospital patients.
The result was that private hospital care was cheaper
although private hospital patients received more direct
nursing care than did public hospital patients of the same
level of dependency.
The cost of community care varied between individual
elderly and was related to the level of dependency. Informal
care was the largest single component of this cost. Models
relating informal and formal care to patient disabilities
showed that informal care responded more strongly to
dependency than did formal care.
Community care was found to be cheaper than hospital
care for all patients sampled, the greatest cost difference
being for the very dependent elderly.

The implications of replacing the conventional normality assumption with the broader assumption that the disturbances follow an elliptically symmetric distribution, are investigated, and three features of the problem of detecting serial correlation in elliptically symmetric disturbances, are studied.
 
 An examination of the conventional justification of the normality assumption in econometrics, conducted in Chapter 2, provides motivation for the study of regression analysis under the elliptical symmetry assumption.
 
 In Chapters 4 and 5, properties of estimators and tests associated with the linear regression model are investigated, assuming elliptically symmetric disturbances. This broadening of the normality assumption is found to have few practical consequences for classical regression analysis. The usual least squares estimators are shown to satisfy a stringent optimality property. Conditions are determined for weak consistency and for strong consistency of these estimators. Distributions of statistics invariant to the disturbances' scale are found to be unaffected by the broadening of the normality assumption, while the distributions of arbitrary statistics can be viewed as mixtures of their distributions for different scales of the disturbances under normality. The implications of these results for hypothesis testing, are explored.

An aspect of reservoir management modelling often neglected is 'risk', although it has been identified as being of prime importance. A utility function can imply an attitude to risk, and in this thesis, a modified stochastic dynamic programming model (SUMDP) is presented which can maximise expected utility, where utility is defined over the range of terminal storage and 'wealth' outcomes and hence is dependent on all decisions made over the planning horizon.
 
 SUMDP is applied to reservoir management in regulated and deregulated representations of the New Zealand electricity system. Experimental results showed that increasing the relative risk aversion to low terminal wealth values reduced the mean and variability of wealth and was achieved by conserving water and hence increasing storage. This effect was amplified by the contract level of the hydro firm in a deregulated case where the reservoir firm was a price setter with financial contracts and the remaining players were price takers.
 
 SUMDP can be applied to other problem classes, one of which is stochastic route choice in acyclic networks. SUMDP is discussed in this context and applied to some example problems. Rather than a single (static) route choice decision being optimal at each node of the network, SUMDP produces optimal non-static decisions which are dependent on the accumulated time taken to reach the node and take into account the utility associated with the time taken to travel the route. There are few approaches discussed in the literature which produce non-static solutions, consider uncertainty, and consider risk, so SUMDP also contributes to this literature.",,,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/4501",,,"en",,,"University of Canterbury.

"4909","10092/839",,,"Giles, Judith A.",,,,,"1990",,"This thesis considers some finite sample properties of preliminary test (pre-test) estimators of the unknown parameters of a (possibly) mis-specified linear regression model. We investigate two types of misspecification which may or may not occur simultaneously. The first relates to the distribution of the regression disturbances, which is assumed to be normal, when in fact, the error distribution belongs to a broader family of spherically symmetric distributions. The second mis-specification is that the model's design matrix may exclude relevant regressors.
 
 We analyse some finite sample properties of three pre-test estimators. The first is an estimator of the prediction vector after a pre-test for exact linear restrictions on the location vector. Secondly, we consider an estimator of the error variance after the same pre-test. Finally, we analyse an estimator of the error variance after a pre-test for homogeneity of the variances in the two-sample linear regression model. In each case we extend the existing literature by generalising the model's error distribution and allowing for model mis-specification through the omission of regressors.
 
 To provide a setting for this research, we survey the relevant pretesting literature in Chapter Two. This discussion assumes that the errors are normally distributed. There is a body of research, however, which proposes that some economic data series may be generated by processes whose underlying distributions have thicker tails than that which would result from a normality assumption. We briefly examine this literature in Chapter Three.
 
 One alternative family of distributions, which has received considerable attention, is the spherically symmetric family of distributions. Well known members of this family include the normal and the multivariate Student-t distributions. So, we include in Chapter Three a rationale for investigating spherically symmetric regression disturbances as an alternative to the usual normality assumption. We also discuss several studies which consider the linear regression model under a spherically symmetric disturbance assumption.
 
 Having provided a setting and rationale for our research in Chapters Two and Three, Chapters Four, Five and Six present the finite sample properties of the aforementioned pre-test estimators. In each of these chapters we derive the exact bias and the exact risk functions (under quadratic loss) of the estimators under the mis-specified regression model. We also give the non-null distributions of the commonly used test-statistics for the investigated pre-tests, and we generalise many of the results reported in the existing literature. In particular, we derive the critical values of the test which result in a minimum of the bias and of the risk of the pre-test estimators of the error variance.
 
 To illustrate the results we assume multivariate Student-t regression disturbances, rather than the general spherically symmetric family, and numerically evaluate the derived expressions for various cases. Our results suggest, when estimating the prediction vector, that the mis-specification of the distribution of the regression disturbances has little impact on the qualitative properties of the predictor pre-test estimator, though there are quantitative effects.
 
 However, when estimating the error variance, after either a pre-test for linear restrictions or for homogeneity of the error variances, we find that mis-specifying the error distribution can have a substantial qualitative, and quantitative, impact on the bias and the risk functions of the estimators. Imposing the linear restrictions, even if they are valid, or always pooling the samples, even if the error variances are identical, may often be inappropriate strategies.

"4910","10092/839",,,"Harfield, Toby",,,,,"1997",,"This thesis is a description of an emergent inquiry which extends the methodological, theoretical, and philosophical conventions which have become entrenched within the strategic management literature. The purpose of the research is to use a postmodern sensibility to describe historical events gleaned from first-person accounts in an attempt to present 'insider views' of managing in a de-regulating economy in a globalizing world. The research is located within the New Zealand experiment of economic, political, and social change during the 1980s and 90s.
 
 The postmodern sensibility has impacted most clearly in the production of this document. The thesis is an example of alternative forms and structures and contents not usually found within the strategic management literature. A processual, reflexive method is used to construct a sense-making narrative which connects the tales of three journeys; managerial, researcher and academic. Postmodern concerns of 'discourse', 'fragmented identities' and 'research as resistance' are used to link the three forms of knowledge production; managerial, researcher, strategic management.
 
 Managers from three New Zealand industries, footwear manufacturing, wine and printing, were interviewed to gain an 'insider view' of firm strategy and industry structure. Although a diversity of issues emerged during the research, I decided that each industry story would privilege one aspect of common threads which I perceived in all of the industries, but which had 'emerged' more strongly in a particular industry during this interpretative research project.
 
 The distinct conclusion that strategy is a journey not a destination as suggested in most of the strategic management literature was evident as the footwear manufacturers retreated from volume. Most managers in this study appear to be intent on continuing the journey rather than arriving at a destination. That cooperation and competition are necessary for industry survival in a de-regulating economy was most evident in the wine industry. It is obvious that a gap exists between the strategic management discourse and the practices and values of managers in this study.  Cooperation\competition appears more significant than competition for industry survival in this small society. Rather than ONE designated strategy, firms are dedicated to a diversity of generic strategy combinations in order to survive in a globalizing economy. Keeping the strategic journey going by 'sustained adaptation' seemed the intention of most of the managers in this study, but especially those in the printing industries. The creation of flexibility within a competitive\cooperative environment is the imperative of firms and industries in this study.",,,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/4499",,,"en",,,"University of Canterbury.

J.",,,,,"1995",,"This thesis investigates the application of marginal cost based spot pricing techniques to the short run coordination of decentralised, and potentially competitive, electricity markets. A Dispatch Based Pricing philosophy is proposed which requires that the dispatcher of a power system determine spot prices which are consistent with both the observed power system dispatch and the offers and bids issued by market participants. Whereas previous research has involved determining prices corresponding to an optimised power system dispatch, Dispatch Based Pricing is more flexible, requiring no such optimality assumption while generating incentives which encourage efficient dispatch. Pricing relationships are formed, and the resulting incentives analysed, by applying duality theory to mathematical programming formulations of the dispatch problem. 
 
 A detailed theoretical description of a dispatch based pricing model, based on an Optimal Power Flow formulation, is presented. This model is an extension of the ex post pricing model of Hogan (1991). As well as presenting a more general representation of dispatch variable relationships, we demonstrate the underlying mathematical relationships which drive the economic interpretation of this model. In addition, we explore the behaviour of transmission flow constraints in cyclic networks, and describe the modifications needed to price for security requirements consistent with current operational practices in New Zealand. 
 
 We explore the extension of Dispatch Based Pricing to situations beyond the scope of the Optimal Power Flow problem, and even to situations which are strictly incompatible with a pure marginal cost based analysis. We develop a ""best compromise"" pricing
approach which, for (seemingly) economically inconsistent dispatches, minimises the side
payments required to account for the difference between the market clearing spot prices
and the offers and bids of the market participants. We develop and discuss methods for
determining dispatch based prices which are consistent with primal inter-temporal
constraints, uncertainty, and integer variables.",,,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/4617",,,"en",,,"University of Canterbury.

this industry therefore has become a crucial policy issue of the governments around
the world. In the thesis, I examine regulation of telecommunications services in OECD
countries. Special attention is given to the New Zealand regulatory regimes before and
after the second regulatory reform. As the first regulatory reform in telecommunications
in New Zealand occurred over a decade ago, regulatory measures had to be adjusted
to suit the current environment. This was the main reason for the establishment of
a government-mandated inquiry. Measures were sought and evaluated to reduce or
eliminate problems that were associated with the old regime, especially the not-very productive
commercial negotiations and the not-very-efficient process and the institution
that operators relied on for solving their disputes. I use Coase Theorem to examine why
commercial negotiations did not work as effectively as the government envisaged. With
the adjustments of regulatory institutions and their functions, the government wishes to
counter the time-consuming dispute resolution process that works against new entrants,
and to increase the incentive to negotiate. The second regulatory reform shifted the
regulatory burden from the courts to the industry and the Commerce Commission.
Comparisons of the two regimes are made to analyse the differences of the two regimes
to achieve better understanding of the social and economic goals of the New Zealand
government. The two regimes are evaluated to provide information on the potential
problems that might emerge in the future. Topics such as the difficulties a regulator
faces in imposing appropriate regulatory measures, the direct relationships of regulation
and competition and the indirect relationships of regulation and telecommunications performance are analysed in depth.",,,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/4662",,,"en",,,"University of Canterbury.

"5703","10092/839","Gu, Clare",,,,,,,"2011",,"The effect of government intervention on business is a longstanding topic in political economy. One of the interesting cases is in recent China, where “socialism with Chinese characteristics” is associated with three decades of rapid economic growth. However, many doubt the sustainability of the “dual-track” approach applied in China, which tries to combine “market track” and “planned track” and achieve national goals without sacrificing firm-specific efficiency. 
  This thesis investigates how the “market economy model dominated by political capital” works in Chinese OMAs. We look at Chinese overseas M&As in the period of 1994-2009. It is a good example because 80% of Chinese overseas M&A took place after China’s “Go Global” policy, and approximately half of the executors are state-owned enterprises. We test whether China’s Go Global policy affected shareholders’ wealth while pursuing government’s long-term goals of strategic resource-seeking and industry restructuring.
  The results show that Chinese OMAs achieved significantly positive performance in the short-run. However, performance decreased and became statistically insignificant over a longer three-year horizon. We find no evidence in the short-run responses of markets that the Go Global policy sacrificed shareholder wealth. However, we find OMAs by state-owned enterprises significantly underperformed private enterprises in the three years following completion of the deal. And there is evidence OMA performance varied across different sectors in the before and after policy periods.
  We also develop a generalized event study approach that pools multi-listings in event samples and “weights” individual listings by the new information they provide. We think this approach can be applied to other empirical studies in international/emerging markets settings.",,,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/5265",,,"en",,,"University of Canterbury.

The cosmetics industry promotes their products using almost exclusively images of attractive, young, highly idealised women, and thus has a significant influence on female appearance ideals worldwide. Extensive research connects viewing idealised images to negative outcomes for consumers’ self-concept, however there are mixed results regarding the effectiveness of idealised models in advertising. Moreover, there are mixed results regarding the effectiveness of different message frames. The overall aim of this thesis is to investigate the effects of possible selves and cosmetic advertising on the consumption of cosmetic products. This research draws together areas of literature which have been studied in varying settings in order to determine the individual and collective effects of these independent variables; possible selves, model idealisation and message framing, on women’s attitude toward cosmetic advertisements and purchase intentions in the cosmetic product context.
To understand the effects that goal orientation, as well as the images and text of cosmetic advertisements have on cosmetics consumption, an online experiment was conducted using a 2x3x2 between-subjects factorial design. The study manipulated three independent variables, namely, salient possible self (hoped-for and feared), model idealisation (more idealised model, less idealised model and no model) and regulatory message framing (desired reference and undesired reference) and measured the impact of these variables on attitude toward the ad and resulting purchase intention. The final data set was comprised of 420 responses from 18-35 year old females.
A series of ANCOVA analyses were used to determine the effects of possible selves, model idealisation and message frames on consumers’ attitude toward the ad and their purchase intention. The results indicate hoped-for selves, no model advertisements and desired message frames are independently the most effective in the cosmetics context. However, the goal-compatibility hypothesis was not supported. Furthermore, findings indicate an interaction between the image and the message of cosmetics advertising, which suggests cosmetic advertisers must carefully consider the combination of the images and messages they use to promote their brand and products.

"6979","10092/839","Kuruppu, Sanjaya Chinthana",,,,,,,"2012",,"Purpose: This purpose of this thesis is to investigate a company’s understanding of ‘sustainability’ and how this concept is integrated into organisational processes and decision making. Firstly, the internal sustainability systems which lead up to external social and environmental reporting will be examined. Secondly, the role of reputation management and legitimacy in driving company response behaviours around short-term and long-term environmental issues will be explored. Prior research is mainly limited to studies on external social and environmental reporting. The present study adds to the literature by exploring the internal mechanisms and behaviours which underlie external reporting practice. New theoretical insights are provided into legitimacy theory by presenting a framework linking aspects of reputation, resource dependence theory, and stakeholder theory.

Design and methodology: Research is conducted through an in-depth case study at a wholly-owned foreign affiliate of a large multinational organisation involved in an environmentally sensitive industry. Data collection was extensive, including semi-structured interviews and non-structured talks with 26 participants from top management executives through to production workers. Access was also granted to confidential reports, participation in the company’s annual environmental seminar and a stakeholder engagement meeting. Analysis was conducted in a number of phases, framed around research questions and themes drawn from prior literature.

Findings: Findings and discussion are presented on three major research questions. Findings on the first research question about internal sustainability systems in the company suggest that senior  management are incorporating sustainability issues into strategic planning. However, concerns over the environment have not fully cascaded down to the lower levels of the firm. Although Management Control and Environmental Management Systems are well integrated, these systems are relatively decoupled from the external reporting process. The second and third research questions focus on the distinction between the concepts of “reputation” and “legitimacy” in the case company.  Three short-term issues and a long-term strategic decision in the company are outlined to illustrate how company response behaviours change according to: 1) the visibility of the issue, 2) stakeholder salience, and 3) the interconnectedness of stakeholders around the problem. The case company prefers direct action to contain problems where possible, and external reporting only features in some scenarios. Ultimately, it is proposed that reputation and legitimacy must be understood in terms of behaviours as well as external reporting outcomes.

Originality/value: There has been a considerable focus on external reporting in corporate sustainability research, particularly in the accounting literature. The work that has been done on internal systems has been largely limited to case study work focused on characteristics and preconditions of sustainability processes together with limitations in current practice. The purpose of this research is to produce an in-depth case study looking at company responses to sustainability issues. It provides some new perspectives on the well researched concept of legitimacy along with some potential avenues for further theory development.",,,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/6577",,,"en",,,"University of Canterbury.

"6980","10092/839","Thnarudee, Chatchai",,,,,,,"2012",,"A crucial limitation of research on strategic planning is that it has always viewed
strategic planning as a single process in a corporation. In practice, strategic
planning in complex multi-business corporations has evolved into a network of
multi-level and multi-unit strategic planning processes. This makes it challenging
for managers and strategists to undertake the activities needed to run those strategic
planning systems effectively. The interactions between strategy practitioners as
they enact those planning processes play a crucial role in determining effectiveness
of the planning process as a whole.
Therefore, this thesis is based on a conceptual framework that represents strategic
planning as a network of collaboration amongst quasi-independent processes taking
place across multiple levels and units. This thesis adopts an embedded design
within two in-depth case studies and one pilot case study to examine the
strategising activities, practices and interaction dynamics of strategic planning
within the M-form based firms. The result articulates the dynamics of strategy
practitioners’ interactions in a series of four generic interaction patterns: (1) the
Bilateral Scheme, (2) the Cohesive Facilitation Scheme, (3) the Ambassadorial
Coordination Scheme, and (4) the Supervisory Driven Scheme. The result also sheds
light on the extended roles of strategic planning within a multi-level and multi-unit
environment, and on how different actors contribute to the vertical and horizontal
aspects of strategic planning.
The findings of this research have implications for both theory and practice. This
thesis mainly contributes to strategy as practice perspective, strategic planning
literature, organisational theory, situated learning literature, sensemaking
perspective on practice, power theory, and agency theory. Theoretically, this study
introduces a new method for examining the practice of strategic planning based on
studying strategic planning links between practitioners representing horizontally as
well as vertically differentiated units. In doing so, I have represented strategic
planning as a multi-unit as well as a multi-level process, and hence have been able
to show how it operates as a network of collaborative relationships and activities.
This extends the view of strategic planning prevailing in the literature, which
portrays a largely hierarchical, vertically-based structure.
Practically, the results provide managers and practitioners with an illustration of
how different practitioner roles and managerial levels contribute in distinctive ways
to strategic planning from both horizontal and vertical perspectives. It is apparent
from my investigation of the case study firms that their planning and decentralised
decision-making mechanisms are linked together heterarchically as well as
hierarchically.",,,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/6576",,,"en",,,"University of Canterbury.

"10129","10092/839","Su, Melissa",,,,,,,"2014",,"This thesis examines the response of Taiwanese hotels to climate change. Climate change is increasingly recognised by industry, governments and researchers as one of the most substantial challenges to the sustainability of tourism at both a destination and business level in both the short and long-term. Hall (2008) observed that tourism was explicitly recognised by the IPCC as one of the most important industries in Asia, yet the lack of research on tourism and climate change in an Asian context was identified, with especially little explicit research on the climate change response of the hospitality and accommodation sector. This is also despite the accommodation sector being the most significant tourism sector contributor to emissions after aviation (United Nations World Tourism Organisation [UNWTO] and United Nations Environment Programme [UNEP] 2008; World Economic Forum [WEF] 2009; Scott et al. 2012). Therefore this research seeks to explicitly respond to this knowledge gap by examining the response of the Taiwanese hotel sector to climate change. It is also the first known study that explores the extent to which the hotel sector meets the specific recommendations of the UNWTO-UNEP (2008) with respect to accommodation sector measures in relation to climate change.

In order to provide a firm basis of methodological comparison with the previous international literature on environmental studies of the accommodation sector, this thesis conducted a baseline survey to investigate the response of Taiwanese hotels towards environment and climate change with respect to four main dimensions, including perception, attitudes, actions, and influencing factors for environmental and climate change practices. Overall, 270 hotel participants answered the email-based questionnaire survey of the total population of Taiwanese hotels, reflecting a response rate of approximately 10%.

Taiwanese hotel respondents acknowledged the existence of climate change, but rarely related this phenomenon to their daily business operations. Their attitude towards their own hotel’s contribution to climate change was especially reserved. In addition to waste management, energy-saving practice, and the offer of local-produced cuisine, the level of implementation of environmental practices in Taiwanese hotels was relatively limited. There were also low compliance rates with existing environmental policy, although they were aware of environmental schemes. 

The factors of size and extreme weather event experience were identified as the more significant variables to differentiate Taiwanese hotel response to environment and climate change. The significance of hotel size, standard, and experience of weather extreme variables were also examined. Finally, this research discussed the prospective contributions and issues of the results of this study, and argues for their application in the fields of climate change research, benchmarking development, education and and training, government regulation and policy, and hotel management.",,,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/9209",,,"en",,,"University of Canterbury.

"10035","10092/839","Bouton, Michelle Ashley",,,,,,,"2014",,"Currently, nutritional labelling is difficult to interpret and time-consuming to read. This is a major problem as many consumers are overweight and resort to eating readymade meals and snacks. These are likely to be energy-dense food and beverages that are high in fat, sugar and artificial preservatives. Simplifying nutritional labels could help stem rising obesity rates. Front-of-pack labels are a tool to help overcome this problem by providing consumers with understandable, visible information to aid them into making healthier food choices.
This study expands on past research by evaluating 7 separate pre-existing, proposed and fictitious front-of-pack nutritional labels. It includes Information, Image or a combination of both Information and Image based labels. Plus No label, which is a control variable to determine the effectiveness of each label.  The nutritional labels were placed on a chicken salad sandwich which was kept consistent for all 14 manipulations. The nutritional components were altered to reflect either an Unhealthy or Healthy sandwich. The design of this experiment is a 2 (nutritional level: Healthy, Unhealthy) X7 (labelling system: Traffic Light, Star, Running, Walking, Third Party, Daily Intake, Caloric, None) between subjects design.
The results provide evidence of the urgent need to communicate nutritional information more effectively. Images, simplicity, colour and reliability, are determining label elements that influence consumption behaviour. The results from this study help to understand behaviours associated to labels. This study draws differences between those who partake in health behaviours and those who do not. This information could help to trigger support for a new, more effective front-of-pack labelling system to be put in place globally to guide consumers in making healthier food choices.",,,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/9048",,,"en",,,"University of Canterbury.

Exploratory case studies involving SMEs and consultants are used to investigate the impact consultants have on SMEs. IS knowledge and IS competencies are important themes that emerge from the exploratory stage of the study. This research further investigates the types of IS knowledge assets and IS competencies that consultants impact in SMEs by conducting further case studies with consultants and SMEs. Several propositions about the types of IS knowledge assets and IS competencies impacted by consultants are developed and tested using a longitudinal single-case study.

The results are analysed using resource-based theory and knowledge-based theory and reveals that consultants contribute to the development of experiential knowledge assets like know-how and experience, routine knowledge assets and systemic knowledge assets by influencing the knowledge creation processes of implementing SMEs. Consultants enhance and contribute to the development of the Management of IT competence which relates to the SME’s ability utilise IS. However, the results also show that consultants compensate for other IS competencies: strategy and vision; sourcing and alignment; and systems and infrastructure. These competencies relate to the SME’s ability to integrate IT with business processes, to source and alignment IT/IS and to engage in business and IS strategic thinking.

It is proposed that in addition to overcoming the knowledge barrier in SMEs, consultants are an essential part of the IS knowledge-creation process. Additionally, consultants compensate for IS competencies which are abilities; however, it is noted that if an on-going relationship develops between the consultants and SMEs then SMEs may, over time, develop IS competencies related to business and IS strategic thinking, management of IT and, sourcing and alignment.",,,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/6933",,,"en",,,"University of Canterbury.

To achieve these objectives, this study first conducted qualitative studies consisting of a focus group with consumers and an interview with a mobile advertising technology provider. Qualitative study results identified the following variables of interest; vividness of the advertisement, product involvement, and consumer goals. Supported by existing literature on advertising, these variables were then used to develop a conceptual model outlining the relationship between the variables and measures of advertising effectiveness.

To empirically examine this model, this study conducted a 3x2x4 experiment of high, medium and low advertisement mode vividness, high and low product involvement and four stages of pre-purchase consumer goals. A total of 288 responses were collected from a student sample from the University of Canterbury, New Zealand. The dependence relationships outlined in the conceptual model were then analysed using ANCOVA, logistic regression, linear regression, and various other non-parametric analysis techniques.

The results of this study suggest that level of advertisement mode vividness and product involvement both exert a strong influence on the effectiveness of the advertisement. However, results on consumer goals suggest that the effectiveness of the advertisement is only affected by whether a consumer goal existed before viewing the advertisement. This study was unable to identify any relationship between the effectiveness of an advertisement and the amount of time users spent viewing an advertisement on a mobile phone.",,,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/7169",,,"en",,,"University of Canterbury.

"7497","10092/839","Sung, Sally Ki-Youn",,,,,,,"2011",,"Consequences of global warming and climate change issues have become more apparent over the last several decades. Heat waves, floods, tornados and storms are not just natural disasters occurring elsewhere, but they are now serious environmental catastrophes threatening New Zealand (NZ) and nearby countries as a result of continously escalating greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Thus, the Kyoto Protocol was prepared for countries to work collaborately to provide a solution through encourging countries to commit themselves to reducing their individual share of the total GHG emissions. To date, NZ has gone through several phases of modification – introducing and revising two distinctive climate change policies (a Carbon Tax and an Emissions Trading Scheme [ETS]) as a tool to reduce GHG in NZ. These attempts to address climate change, coupled with the question raised by McDonald (Irish Times, 2009) doubting the actual effect of a tax on behaviour-change, provide an extensive basis for a case study in a NZ context involving an evaluation of the effectiveness of these regimes on incentivising behaviour-change to reduce and stablise the level of GHG emissions. 

In an attempt to answer the research question and conduct a case study in a NZ context, a triangulation approach incorporating both quantitative and qualitative research methods was undertaken. Statistical data analysis was conducted as a quantitative method to analyse and compare numerical changes 'with‘ and 'without‘ the existence of climate change policies. To enhance the results obtained from the quantitative research, qualitative information was also collected by interviewing politicians directly related to the introduction, implementation and the review process of the climate change policies in a semi-structured manner.

The results of this study reinforced the need for regulations and policies to reduce and maintain the level of GHG emissions. Statistical data analysis proved that the existence of climate change policies results in lower level of GHG emissions. The interviewees also perceived that some sort of policy is definitely required to regulate the level of emissions, although whether the current, National-led Government‘s modfied-ETS is the 'right' approach is still uncertain. However, the majority of interviewees agreed that the type of tool does not matter, as long as it is correctly-designed to reflect the necessary policies to influence the decision making process of individuals and businesses, and ultimately change their behaviour as a result. However, in order to maintain NZ‘s relationship with other countries, it is preferable to retain its ETS regime until other countries decide to do otherwise.",,,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/6934",,,"en",,,"University of Canterbury.

While previous studies have examined thematic and reading ease manipulation, these have viewed such impression management techniques in isolation. This research is the first to simultaneously examine the prevalence of these impression management strategies across such a range of corporate communications. In particular, no previous studies have looked at the thematic and reading ease manipulation of standalone CSR reports or compared the various sections/disclosures included within the same annual report. Of significance are the inclusion of several additional themes, namely Activity; Optimism; Certainty; Realism and Commonality, advancing the scope of thematic manipulation research from the limited positive and negative themes.
It is important to examine a range of correspondence because no one form of correspondence is the same. Financial notes are heavily regulated and audited and thus should be less susceptible to manipulation. CSR disclosures have little to no regulation or audit process and as such are very susceptible to manipulation. Likewise, the two distinct reports service different audiences, who can be expected to have different expertise.
This research discovers what firm characteristics are determinates of the readability and thematic content in particular specific disclosure types, industries and country of listing. Financial performance tests reveal that there is evidence of manipulation of readability to obfuscate the disclosures of poor performing companies while the themes of these poorly performing company’s disclosures closely mirror those that are performing well. In addition to the traditional performance based tests, a novel new test that combines the traditional thematic positivity variable and readability shows that positive disclosures are significantly more readable than negative ones, strengthening the obfuscation hypothesis. This research also motivates the need of a purpose built reading ease formula based on corporate disclosures that outputs a result that allows the comparison of disclosures. Indeed a very basic example of such a formula is developed as a starting point for additional research.",,,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/7370",,,"en",,,"University of Canterbury.

"8912","10092/839","Crombie, Neil Alan",,,,,,,"2013",,"Purpose: This PhD research examines how two different institutional logics of corporate governance have shaped the discourse on executive remuneration.  Corporate Logic implies executives are intrinsically motivated and will act in the best interests of shareholders as long as their total remuneration is competitive and fair.  On the other hand, Investor Logic implies executives are extrinsically motivated (opportunistic) and will only act in the best interests of shareholders if short- and long-term incentive schemes are designed appropriately.

Approach: The research has an interpretive methodology and consists of three phases.  First, the diffusion of both Logics is examined through a content analysis of a large sample of corporate governance codes of practice and corporate annual reports.  Second, how both Logics are embedded in the remuneration principles and practices that are recommended by code issuers and adopted by companies is scrutinised using discourse analysis.  Third, how both Logics have shaped the beliefs and decision-making of non-executive directors, executives, and others is studied using discourse analysis.

Findings: Both Logics are embedded in the discourse on executive remuneration, although there has been a strengthening of Investor Logic over time.  Both Logics co-exist as distinct from compete in the discourse because it has become taken-for-granted that executives should be remunerated comparably to other executives (Corporate Logic) and in line with shareholder returns (Investor Logic).  Directors and others manage tension between Corporate Logic and Investor Logic by prioritising (or ordering) the Logics. 

Theoretical implications: The research shows how competitive and institutional pressures influence how remuneration decisions are made and reported.  However, institutional change is complex because companies influence and are influenced by code issuers and others.

Practical implications: As both Logics are embedded in the beliefs of companies, code issuers and others, executive remuneration practices have become unnecessarily complex and convoluted.  The case for a simpler approach to executive remuneration is advanced.",,,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/8202",,,"en",,,"University of Canterbury.

It maps global aspects of welfare change: governance mechanisms, social policies and service provision developed at the global level. As it maps the relocation of social services from national to global, the research discusses the consequences for traditional and new understandings of publicness. Publicness has been slow to make its way into global forms of social policy-making and service provision, even if social services have been historically considered public, and vital for the governing of social life. A new form of publicness, global publicness, therefore, rises as an alternative political frame for more effective governance frameworks to come forward. Developing global publicness, however, requires profound economic, legal, cultural and political changes. Because these changes will not happen overnight, a maturity approach is suggested, instead of a purely outcomes-based approach. In order to map global social governance and suggest a maturity approach, I draw from international law and materials, multi-disciplinary theory and three case studies.

"8988","10092/839",,,"Maxton, J. K.",,,,,"1982",,"This thesis examines three aspects of the law of succession which, it is contended, are ripe for reform.
 Modern testamentary practice is governed by s.9 of the Wills Act 1837. That section stipulates the formalities which must be complied with in order to execute a valid will. These apparently simple requirements have produced complex case law due, in large part, to the courts' rigorous insistence on any defect in the formalities automatically voiding a will. An examination of the case law coupled with a study of the underlying rationale for the existence of the formalities is undertaken. Using that background it is suggested that a relaxation of the formalities in cases where the rationale for their existence still obtains will better serve the interests of ""a nicer justice"" than the present position does. A comparison of six jurisdictions which have instigated innovations in this area of law concludes the first chapter.
 The second aspect of the law of succession which is discussed concerns mistakes: how mistakes can occur and how they may be remedied. A categorisation of the common law is attempted: a task beset by difficulties because of sporadic judicial eagerness to overcome legislative inaction. The result comprises many fine distinctions in the interests of trying to ""do justice"" allied with dissatisfaction on the part of the judiciary on the complicated nature of the law and their limited powers under it.
 A case for the extension of those powers is made in third chapter where, after examining the jurisdiction of the courts, it is argued first, that rectification ought to be available as a remedy in the law of wills, and, secondly, that the rules regarding the admission of extrinsic evidence ought to be relaxed.",,,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/8245",,,"en",,,"University of Canterbury.

The result is that the chosen stocks will be only weakly correlated with each other. However, since correlation matrices are high dimensional, it is close to impossible to determine correlation clusters by simply looking at a correlation matrix. It is therefore common to regard industry groups as correlation clusters. In this thesis, we used three visualization methods namely Hierarchical Cluster Trees, Minimum Spanning Trees and neighbor-Net splits graphs to “collapse” correlation matrices’ high dimensional structures onto two-dimensional planes, and then assign stocks into different clusters to create the correlation clusters. We then simulated sets of portfolios where each set contains 1000 portfolios, and stocks in each of the portfolio were picked from the correlation clusters suggested by each of the three visualization methods and industry groups (another way of determine correlation clusters). The mean and variance distribution of each set of 1000 simulated portfolios gives us an indication of how well those clusters were determined.
The examinations were conducted on two sets of financial data. The first one is the 30 stocks in the Dow Jones Industrial average which contains relatively small number of stocks and the second one is the ASX 200 which contains relatively larger number of stocks. We found none of the methods studied consistently defined correlation clusters more efficiently than others in out-of-sample testing.

"10681","10092/839",,,"Mirvahedi, Saeed",,,,,"2014",,"This thesis investigates the role of serendipity, effectuation, and entrepreneurial marketing in fast-growth entrepreneurial firms. Using a qualitative paradigm, multiple case studies and cross-country approaches, the study aims to explore the interrelationships among these constructs and answer the main research question relating to their contribution to fast growth. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with twenty fast-growth firms in New Zealand and Iran from a range of sectors, and causal mapping method was used to map out the growth trajectory of each firm. Causal maps enable the researcher to find in what manner the firms achieved fast growth and what factors contributed to their growth.
The results suggest that serendipity is a precursor to fast growth and occurs generally at the start of a growth process. Serendipity is likely to take place at any stage of a firm life cycle, but more likely at the early stage of formation, alongside networks, pure luck, perseverance, environment and high-quality products and services. In addition to reviewing the three patterns of serendipity that are well-known in accidental scientific discoveries, we identify and introduce “Entrepreneurial Serendipity” as another distinctive pattern in entrepreneurship, whereby entrepreneurs look for any opportunity to start a business and explore an appropriate opportunity that comes along. Further analyses illustrate that entrepreneurs believe in the occurrence of serendipity in their day-to-day business; however, it indirectly contributes to fast growth mediated by two important elements: effectual thinking and entrepreneurial marketing. 
The causal maps demonstrate that the combination of effectuation and entrepreneurial marketing directly and indirectly lead to fast growth. A majority of fast-growth firms start business effectuatively, often with limited resources and relying on whatever available means they possess, but over time, they shift to causation logic with more planning and strategic decisions. Starting from an effectuation base, the participants had an entrepreneurial mindset at the outset and used specific tactics, such as an adapted marketing mix, relying on networks, innovation, ensuring a presence in the market, pro-activeness, and market intelligence through personal observation. These entrepreneurial marketing practices have led to fast growth and were widely employed by entrepreneurs, irrespective of firm size and age. 
The thesis sheds some light on how fast-growth firms achieve considerable growth by looking at the relationship of serendipitous opportunity exploration and effectuative exploitation using entrepreneurial marketing. It contributes to the literature on serendipity and its development in entrepreneurship, and identifies serendipitous sources of opportunity in fast growing firms. The study confirms that effectuation logic and entrepreneurial marketing are instruments by which entrepreneurs exploit new opportunities and market products or services. Entrepreneurs from both New Zealand and Iran share similar growth trajectories, however, some Iranian entrepreneurs believe that spiritual values are important in exploring new opportunities and achieving fast growth. Finally, the study confirms that growth may start with a serendipitous exploration and continues with effectuation logic and entrepreneurial marketing.",,,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/9645",,,"en",,,"University of Canterbury.

Using this model, the research examines how manipulations of social comparison and vanity are reflected in these relationships and the resulting impact on purchase behaviour. To empirically test this model, an online experiment using a 3x2 between-subjects factorial design was conducted, where respondents were exposed to modified print advertisements for luxury branded sunglasses. A total of 297 responses were collected from a pool of Amazon’s Mechanical Turk workers, which were analysed using multiple regression, factorial ANCOVA and path analysis to assess the hypothesised relationships. The results indicate that vanity appeals were indeed responsible for the way in which the product was evaluated which positively translated into purchase consideration. However, though social comparison was proven to negatively impact on self-esteem, this change in self-esteem was not significant in determining purchase behaviour.

"13978","10092/839",,"Zhong, Hao",,,,,,"2016",,"By implementing the Pilot Program for the Collection of Value Added Tax instead of Business Tax, China has started a move to a Value Added Tax (VAT). There were two models of VAT/Goods and Services Tax (GST) available to policymakers: the traditional VAT model and the modern GST model. VATs adopted in the European Union are the typical examples of using the traditional VAT model, whereas the GST system introduced in 1986 in New Zealand is regarded as the leading example of the modern GST model.
This research aims to determine which model China should use going forward to develop further its VAT regime, and provide recommendations for future reforms. First, the thesis introduces the theory and history of VAT, and discusses Adam Smith's four principles of taxation, which are equity, certainty, convenience, and efficiency, along with the principles of simplicity and neutrality. These principles are crucial due to the fact that they are the standard criteria used to evaluate a tax regime. In addition to these principles, debates over the tax base (wide or narrow), tax rate (single or multiple), and the registration threshold (high or low), are also discussed.
Second, this research examines three VAT/GST systems, namely, China's VAT system, the European Union's VAT system, and New Zealand's GST system, in terms of the tax base, tax rate structure, and the registration approach.
Finally, the results of this research show that China chose the traditional VAT model to develop its new VAT regime. By conducting research on the modern GST model, it is suggested that the single tax rate structure and a broad tax base are the essential requirements for an ideal VAT/GST system. In the light of the status quo, the culture of Chinese society may not suit the modern GST system as used in New Zealand because the tax collection and administration level is not at a high standard in China. On the basis that the researcher believes the modern GST model is the best model for China, policymakers in China could develop its VAT by gradually moving towards the modern GST model.

"15725","10092/839",,"Kaur, Harpreet",,,,,,"2016",,"The Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender (LBGT) community faces significant
discrimination in today’s society. Discrimination is not limited only to various sectors such as
health, education, housing, employment, politics, sociocultural representation, and within the
mainstream marketing (Badgett, 2014). In the media their portrayal has been very suppressive,
often having the media reinforce already existing stereotypes Hart, 2004). Marketing, being a
vector for change, bring about social acceptance as it has the right tools for instigating evolved
attitudes in society (Zinkhan & Carlson, 1995). Due to the institutionalized expressions of
homophobia that have been present within societies (Abelove, Barlae & Halperin, 1993), the
amount of research on marketing responses from LGBT members is very limited (Tsai, 2011).
The objective of this study is to highlight LGBT participants’ perceptions towards the marketing
style that features LGBT styles in advertisements. Organizations try to promote ethical diversity
through marketing to appeal to both the LGBT community and non-LGBT people/members of
society (Borgerson, et al., 2006). In the current study, 12 in-depth interviews were conducted to
investigate LGBT participants’ perceptions on the marketing styles that feature the LGBT
community. The participants included gay, bisexual and transgender individuals. Through using
qualitative analysis along with photo-elicitation to demonstrate how organizations have used the
LGBT community in their marketing, participants were able to provide insightful opinions paired
with their experiences while ‘coming out’. They also explained how the use of LGBT marketing
influences their experience of being ‘normalized’ into society. It was found that organizations
reinforced negative stereotypes through their marketing strategies. Furthermore, the language
used in the marketing materials involved derogatory terms and involved objectification of their
sexual orientation and identity. Lastly, the research concludes on how marketing can engage and
integrate LGBT members in a socially acceptable practice. Organizations can establish a trustbased
relationship with the LGBT community and feature them in advertisements in a realistic
way, thus establishing a robust framework to eradicate the social stigma associated with the
LGBT community.",,,,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/12877",,"en","English",,"University of Canterbury",,,,,"http://library.canterbury.ac.nz/thesis/etheses_copyright.shtml",,"All Rights Reserved",,,,,,,,,,,"The determinants of consumer responses in the LGBT community : an exploratory study of LGBT marketing in the context of New Zealand and USA advertisements.","Theses / Dissertations",,,,,"Marketing",,"University of Canterbury",,"Masters",,,"Master of Commerce",,"2381082",,,"College of Business and Law, University of Canterbury",,,"Pkaur25@me.com",,,,,,,,"Associate Professor Ekant Veer"

The PRISMA structure acted as a guiding framework to ensure a transparent and methodical process was followed.
After all necessary exclusions were made, the sample revealed 54 eligible articles for the present study. Relevant data from each eligible article was extracted by the researcher after examination of the full-text article. Data regarding the year of publication, authorship characteristics, geographical location, paradigmatic stance, research method, and research topic was put into a centralised file for analysis. The aggregation of the data mined from each individual article revealed trends in the literature.
The findings showed a general increase in the existence of critical marketing publication- articles accepted into the study spanned from the year 1994 to 2015. In contrast to the suggestion of previous literature, 44% of articles were produced by an individual author and thus co-authorship and collaboration are not an overwhelming characteristic of the literature studied. Similarly, only 13% of articles were identified as exhibiting evidence of international collaboration between authors. A total of 102 authors contributed to the articles in the study, 63% of these identifying as male and 37% as female.

"13487","10092/839",,"Darbi, Phanuel William Kofi",,,,,,"2016",,"In response to calls for more strategy-as-practice studies that foreground structural and relational linkages in strategy practice, this thesis investigated strategic networking practices of informal printing businesses in Ghana. Despite the increasing interest in strategy as situated practice, studies that examine strategy work in the informal economy are lacking. The informal economy has been pervasive despite earlier predictions of its demise; it contributes significantly to social and economic lives through the provision of essential low cost products and services, and generation of employment. Informal businesses are integral to the competitiveness of formal firms in some economies, through their involvement in supply chains and strategic networks. Their contribution to global commerce has also been acknowledged, however we know little about how they organise, manage, and strategise to achieve these. The informal economy thus presents opportunities for unveiling new insights, given the peculiar characteristics of the setting and participants, and the consequence these may have for shaping their strategising practices.
Previous calls for strategy-as-practice research that bridge micro-macro treatments, in order to connect strategy work to agents embedded in states, fields, sectors, institutions, societies, cultures, and organisations remain to be fully realised. Invariably, an investigation of the informality phenomenon and its implicit complicity with strategic networking practices at the level of individual actors, businesses, field, institutions, the state, and the larger society in which they are embedded is expected to fill some of these gaps. The research employed Pierre Bourdieu’s practice theory incorporating the concepts of field, capital and habitus as a theoretical framework for the analysis. A case study employing organisational ethnographic data collection techniques was adopted. An embedded case design option was employed to select participant informal printing businesses which were sampled purposefully and accessed via snowballing strategies. Network partners were also contacted by these means in a multi-sited data collection approach. Ghana, a developing country, was selected because of its history of a large informal economy and ease of access. Data collection methods included semi-structured interviews, shadowing, observations, and documents that provided secondary sources of data. A two-phase data analysis process with thematic analysis phase preceding a Bourdieusian analysis phase was adopted.
The findings categorised strategic networking practices of the informal printing businesses and their network partners into five main themes: ‘Drivers’, ‘Nature of relationships’, ‘Partners and exchanges’, ‘Building and managing relationships’, and ‘Outcomes’. Bourdieusian analysis that interpreted these findings articulated the strategic networking practices as an enactment of field logic of practice. The informal businesses engaged in strategic networking for the sake of practical coping in consonance with capital deficiencies that necessitated the creation of exchange-value. Exchange-value was created through capital exchanges amongst agents from fields with different logics, in order to transition to market opportunities controlled by dominant formal organisation field players. Interdependence behaviours (cooperative and/or co-opetitive) that sat comfortably with the focal field’s social structures (including material artefacts), and therefore agents’ dispositions and implicit codes of conduct, structured the conditions for these capital exchange and utilisation practices. To this end, the strategic networking practices were influenced by micro, meso and macro-level factors such as agents’ trajectories, the creative industry, the market, dominant players in the field of the informal printing economy, the regulatory framework, society, and trends in global trade. Again these ‘drivers’ delivered ‘outcomes’ at multiple levels that reached far beyond the local level of strategic networking practice. The study further suggests that the ‘drivers’ and ‘outcomes’ constructed, and were constructed by each other in a continuous cycle, much the same way that the strategic networking practice shaped, and was shaped by the social structures of the field in which the practices happened. This is depicted in a conceptual framework developed to summarise the findings.
The findings make a number of contributions that relate to the structural and relational approach to the study of strategy work. They capture the contextual complexities that are often treated lightly in traditional strategy scholarship generally, and network studies specifically. Also the research has given impetus to macro-level influences, as well as generative mechanisms that underlie strategy practice. The ways these were internalised by agents are illustrated. The findings further demonstrate the role of materiality in strategy work, especially how work spaces could produce strategy, and at the same time, be products of strategy work. Secondly the findings demonstrate the institutionalisation of materiality in a field of practice. Finally, the findings highlight the fine-grained ‘on-goings’ in the relationships between formal and informal businesses which is yet to be significantly captured in the strategic management literature.

This was accomplished by systematically studying how the Canadian Inuit, Swedish Sámi and other indigenous people use Rangifer tarandus for enterprise. The Inuit and Sámi are indigenous circumpolar people living in Canada and Northern Europe for more than 4000 years. Rangifer tarandus known as caribou or tuktu by the Canadian Inuit and reindeer by the Sámi has been a key resource for survival.

A literature review was conducted relating 1) to Canadian Inuit, Swedish Sámi and other selected circumpolar indigenous people use of caribou or reindeer for enterprise, and 2) indigenous entrepreneurship, particularly from traditional resources, and how this is affected by context and culture. Research methods included descriptive exploratory comparative cases, participative observation, snowball sampling as well as indigenous research methods. Five field sites were visited: Rankin Inlet and Coral Harbour in Nunavut; Inukjuak in Nunavik, Quebec; Happy Valley-Goose Bay/ North West River in Labrador; and Jokkmokk, in Northern Sweden. 

The thesis explored: 1) Why are the Inuit hunters of caribou and the Sámi herders of reindeer? 2) What were the products and value-added processing? 3) Why have the Sámi successfully sold their meat and products in the international market while the Inuit have only recently begun to do so? 4) How has their culture and traditional knowledge affected the entrepreneurship including innovation and opportunity recognition? 5) What barriers have they faced and how have these been overcome? 6) How have they measured the success of their enterprises? 7) What can they learn from each other?  

The findings indicated the Inuit and Sámi uses of caribou and reindeer for enterprise were very different. Context and culture were extremely important. Indigenous people living at similar latitudes and making use of a similar species had very different trajectories and outcomes in indigenous economic development and entrepreneurship from Rangifer tarandus. Themes such as resource availability, cultural propensity, remoteness and geographic location, kinship and social capital, infrastructure, measures of success, indigenous knowledge and wisdom, and innovation and adaptation were important. 

This work made a significant contribution as little consideration had been given to the voice and perspectives of the Canadian Inuit and Swedish Sámi in the emerging field of indigenous entrepreneurship especially as it relates to traditional resources and practices. It also helped to identify other potential commercial uses of caribou thus it provided more potential value added from the commercial harvesting and processing. These opportunities could assist in increasing Inuit employment, income, self-reliance, and community esteem.

"10023","10092/839",,,"Algera, Puck Marloes",,,,,"2014",,"Despite the growing consensus on the importance of an extended responsibility for business, both the conceptual and practical understanding of “corporate responsibility” has remained limited. Corporate responsibility is still often understood as an add-on to business-as-usual or as a strategy to enhance business performance. In fact, in recent years, the concept of corporate responsibility has become associated with corporate deceit instead of corporate contributions to society, and tends to engender cynicism rather than a sense of hope. In this study I sought to explore a more hopeful and more “radical” conceptualisation of corporate responsibility. By looking at an international sample of “exemplary” values-driven businesses, this study provides insight into corporate responsibility not primarily as a means towards commercial ends but as an expression of a desire to “do good” and create social and/or environmental value. This study paints a picture of the rich, responsible reality of values-driven businesses. It describes their generous, human-centred approach to employees and the internal environment. It explores their deep sense of interdependence with the wider community in which they find themselves, and their extensive engagement with a wide variety of external parties, many of which are not “naturally” connected to business. It creates an understanding of the iterative, emerging and evolutionary nature of the CSR implementation process and the inherent impermanence of CSR “solutions”. While this study gives a comprehensive insight into various, generous and progressive practices, it shows that the essence of a “responsible existence” is not the implementation of certain practices alone, but relates to the willingness and ability to continuously question the established ways and practices of business in light of the higher business aspirations, which, for many, leads to a fundamentally different way of organising, managing and governing the business. At the same time, this study does not provide a glorified account of some kind of “utopian” responsible existence. Instead, it shows the “messy” reality of trying to implement social and environmental values, while faced with multiple demands and when embedded within a social and business context that does not necessarily hold the same values. The thesis describes the various conflicts and compromises related to the implementation of multiple, conflicting commitments and demands, and the different ways in which the sample businesses approach such situations. While the sample businesses are quite capable of gracefully navigating these conflicts in creative and pragmatic ways, the research also indicates that significant compromises are seemingly inevitable, and can, almost imperceptibly, move a company away from its envisaged values and commitments. Finally, this study argues that the currently dominant approach to corporate responsibility in organisational studies, which reflects a rationalised and economic perspective on CSR and business, will be insufficient to describe the rich reality found within these businesses, as it will edit out some of its most essential elements. I conclude this dissertation by proposing an alternative, human existential lens through which corporate responsibility in values-driven businesses can be understood. Through a review of the research findings in relation to three existential themes, I show that a human existential perspective is better suited to explore both the beauty and the struggle of values-driven businesses.",,,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/9028",,,"en",,,"University of Canterbury.

"12719","10092/839","Hatton, Tracy",,,,,,,"2015",,"Organisations play a vital role in assisting communities to recover from disasters.  They are the key providers of goods and services needed in both response and recovery efforts.  They provide the employment which both anchors people to place and supports the taxation base to allow for necessary recovery spending.  Finally, organisations are an integral part of much day to day functioning contributing immensely to people’s sense of ‘normality’ and psychological wellbeing.  Yet, despite their overall importance in the recovery process, there are significant gaps in our existing knowledge with regard to how organisations respond and recover following disaster.

This research fills one part of this gap by examining collaboration as an adaptive strategy enacted by organisations in the Canterbury region of New Zealand, which was heavily impacted by a series of major earthquakes, occurring in 2010 and 2011. Collaboration has been extensively investigated in a variety of settings and from numerous disciplinary perspectives.  However, there are few studies that investigate the role of collaborative approaches to support post-disaster business recovery. This study investigates the type of collaborations that have occurred and how they evolved as organisations reacted to the resource and environmental change caused by the disaster.  

Using data collected through semi-structured interviews, survey and document analysis, a rich and detailed picture of the recovery journey is created for 26 Canterbury organisations including 14 collaborators, six non-traders, five continued traders and one new business.    Collaborations included two or more individual businesses collaborating along with two multi-party, place based projects. Comparative analysis of the organisations’ experiences enabled the assessment of decisions, processes and outcomes of collaboration, as well as insight into the overall process of business recovery.

This research adopted a primarily inductive, qualitative approach, drawing from both grounded theory and case study methodologies in order to generate theory from this rich and contextually situated data.    Important findings include the importance of creating an enabling context which allows organisations to lead their own recovery, the creation of a framework for effective post-disaster collaboration and the importance of considering both economic and other outcomes.  Collaboration is found to be an effective strategy enabling resumption of trade at a time when there seemed few other options available.  While solving this need, many collaborators have discovered significant and unexpected benefits not just in terms of long term strategy but also with regard to wellbeing.  Economic outcomes were less clear-cut.  However, with approximately 70% of the Central Business District demolished and rebuilding only gaining momentum in late 2014, many organisations are still in a transition stage moving towards a new ‘normal’.",,,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/10927",,,"en",,,"University of Canterbury.

The inability to manage risks is an area that contributes to these losses, specifically due to uncertain outcomes when dealing with an interconnected construct such as risk, and a research gap at the tactical and operational levels between risks and controls. 

A comparative case study approach, encompassing 12 different organisations was adopted to explore emerging patterns at the project implementation level, and from this three contributions emerged. After observing risks behaving in a hierarchical fashion with predictable results, Hierarchy of Risk models representing different implementation stages were constructed. Although these models are still in their formative stages, it may prove useful in furthering our understanding of the close inter-relationship between different risks, where they occur in ERP implementations and the implications of managerial choice when determining risk prioritisation. A second finding is that no direct linear relationship appears to exist between risks and controls. Rather, this counter-intuitive finding suggests that it is additional factors including risk categories, implementation stages, prior control decision making and the hierarchical flow-on effect of impacts as a consequence of identified risks. Finally, by combining the Hierarchy of Risk models and the risk-to-impact-to-control relationship, a method of reverse engineering portfolios of control was discovered.  This potentially offers an explanation as to how portfolios of control can be constructed, and why they are essential in ERP implementations.",,,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/9050",,,"en",,,"University of Canterbury.

"9775","10092/839","Ivory, David Douglas Charles",,,,,,,"2013",,"This is a research study on enterprise education in a New Zealand secondary school. Over the past two decades, enterprise education has become a feature of secondary education globally. The emergence of this new phenomenon exists in a context of global neo-liberal initiatives. Within New Zealand, enterprise is now a mainstream feature of secondary education. The practice of enterprise education has a significant impact on schools and student learning. 

The emergence of enterprise within secondary education is a story of power. This research examines who has power in terms of enterprise education and who are the winners and losers.

A sole case study assists in providing answers to these research questions. The case study school is a national role model for enterprise education. The school has experienced extraordinary success and has developed a social enterprise model. Stakeholders’ relationships within and outside the school are explored. In order to explore power, Lukes’ (2005) three-dimensional model of power has been adopted. This model is broad and captures all the dimensions of power, including the work of other theorists of power. 

The results show that power is vested in several stakeholders. Different weight is attached to different stakeholder voices. Tensions in the commercial world between social enterprise and commercial enterprise are also reflected at the school. There are few concrete examples of decision making. Most power is exercised through non-decision making and as a result of a new culture of enterprise supported by media attention. A social enterprise model has embraced existing school values and provides for partnerships with the community. There is fluidity between winners and losers from the model; however, the former include enterprise students, and school, state, Catholic Church and business interests. The latter are those who are not fully engaged with enterprise, through the Young Enterprise Scheme (YES), and those within the college community and stakeholders who have been denied a voice.

The case study school has developed a unique social enterprise model. The model has diffused sharp business values to provide an acceptable model for the school. The model has developed, but on occasion lacks authenticity and appears tokenistic. A need exists for genuine opportunities for consultation with all stakeholders. This research has captured a journey of power, which operates at different levels. There is a power that exists within the school community and wider stakeholders. Power is intimately linked to the notion of interests. It is clearly in the interests of the case study school to survive within a neo-liberal environment, which has affected the structure of all schools. This insight into the power of enterprise education can inform best practice and influence policy.",,,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/8960",,,"en",,,"University of Canterbury.

"15794","10092/839",,"Jeremiah, Faith",,,,,,"2016",,"Purpose – Globally, franchising is recognised as the fastest growing business development model (Dant, 2008; Stanworth et al., 2004), contributing trillions of dollars and vast employment opportunities to the global economy. Yet remarkably, an extensive number of franchisors cease franchising during the first few years (Stanworth, 2004). Given this situation, it is surprising that there is scant literature exploring both the transformation from a conventional business model to the franchise model and the choice to cease franchising, especially from the franchisor’s perspective. This study uses franchisors’ start-up narratives to explore their experience of the strategic evolution process (strategic planning, practice, and sensemaking) and the role this experience plays in start-up success and in the franchisor’s commitment to continue franchising. It does this by examining franchisors’ narratives about their experiences and the sense they make of these across the crucial first few years in 53 businesses that were transformed from a conventional business model to a franchising model.
Design/Methodology/Approach – An interpretive approach was used to capture the experience of transforming a business to a franchise model from the franchisor’s perspective and the sense the franchisors made of this experience; the narratives were used as a means to obtain rich data (Mills & Pawson, 2006) on what was supporting, surrounding, and changing in relation to this business model transformation. The analysis package NVivo was used to facilitate coding and code management as well as sophisticated analyses of the relationships between codes (Godau, 2004).
Franchisors’ start-up narratives (N=53) were gathered from three groups of franchisors in New Zealand: nascent (N=14), successful (N=22), and ceased (N=17). These start-up narratives were gathered using in-depth semi-structured interviews, each lasting on average of 120 minutes. The three groups contributed detailed perspectives from different franchising stages: nascent (franchising from 0 to 3 years), proven successful (franchising for at least 10 years), and ceased (completely withdrawn from franchising while the original business remained in operation). The researcher interviewed the full population of available franchisors in these three groups who matched the selection criteria. Interviews were conducted via internet video (Skype) to take advantage of the benefits of the face-to-face interview (Nigel & Horrocks, 2010), while accommodating franchisors’ irregular and demanding time schedules, geographic locations, and the time and financial limitations of the researcher.
To begin, each narrative was examined in its entirety to gain a sense of the start-up sequence of events and the franchisor’s overall orientation towards franchise start-up. Next, all start-up narratives were categorised according to the chronology of business development stages (e.g., prior preparation, planning, and implementation). Then, the language used in franchisors’ accounts of their experiences in these stages, including their use of ideational elements such as metaphors, arguments, and definitions, was examined in finer detail. This enabled the researcher to identify prevalent themes and patterns, explanatory concepts, and the ways in which these were entwined as well as the purpose they served in franchisors’ business transformation narratives. Finally, each franchisor’s story was compared with those of other participants, taking notice of commonalities, contradictions, and disjunctions of various kinds to create a set of factors influencing the franchising outcome. The inductive analysis in this sensemaking study meant the franchisors’ interpretations of their start-up experiences shaped the conceptual framework that emerged from the findings.
Results/Findings – The analysis revealed that, while all franchisors’ first franchise start-up stories shared a common chronology of processes and experiences, the franchisors held divergent understandings about many aspects of those experiences. It was found that how each franchisor made sense of their business was key to unravelling why some ceased franchising while others became successful.
The first level of narrative analysis revealed that the primary factor influencing franchise withdrawal was lack of alignment between the original business and franchise operation. Alignment refers to the process of adjusting managerial practices, resource allocation, and strategic planning and practice so that both the franchise and the conventional business work as interdependent entities. The narratives revealed that the sense that there was a lack of alignment caused destabilising tensions as both the business and the franchising require attention, yet the owner/operator’s internal conflict drove inconsistencies and a lack of cohesion between franchising operations and the conventional business operations. Noticeably, the ceased group either prioritised franchising over the business, causing detrimental effects to the conventional business, or prioritised the original business over franchising, thus compromising the franchise format. In contrast, it was clearly evident that the successful franchisors effectively managed the franchise and original business in a balanced and coordinated fashion and did not have a sense there was a lack of alignment. Some franchisors in the nascent group mirrored these successful participants, while others reported experiencing inconsistencies similar to the ceased group.
Deeper analysis revealed why franchising was not always aligned with the conventional business. It was found that all 53 participants experienced an identity dilemma as they made fundamental changes to their original business. An identity dilemma refers to the quandary business owners reported facing in their sense of self when transforming from owner/operator to franchisor. The dilemma emerged as they managed “who they were” as business people in the face of changes in roles, activities, and business structure. The multifaceted nature of this dilemma meant that the new franchise identity could only be accepted through a process of conceptual shifts.
Ultimately, to support successful continuation, a hybrid identity was needed as this provided the latitude to foster alignment between the franchise format and the core business. If this hybrid identity was not created, then withdrawal from franchising occurred. Fundamental to explaining why some franchisors created a hybrid identity and others did not, are the concepts of identity centrality (IC): the level of psychological attachment to one’s identity, and experimentation disposition (ED): the individual’s propensity to consider and negotiate other identities as relevant parts of the self. A hybrid is an amalgam of the two concepts; low ED/high IC and high ED/low IC are both hybrids of IC and ED. Those who demonstrated a low ED and high IC ceased franchising, and those with a high ED and low IC successfully continued.
Evidence of emerging hybrid identities was found in the narrated experiences of the nascent group, illustrating that those who were in the process of creating a hybrid identity were also evidencing business-franchise alignment. This pattern, whereby a hybrid identity emerged as the original business and franchise operations were aligned, that was evident in the nascent groups influenced the future outcome of these franchises to some extent. Thus, this study demonstrated that not only do individuals enact their self-constructed identity, but their identity is also created from their actions, and individuals are motivated to act in ways which reinforce this sense of self. The analysis showed that a franchisor’s start-up strategy, in practice, is identity forming and the emerging identity affects how strategy is subsequently formed. Ultimately, the optimum position for successful continuation of the franchise format is both a hybrid identity and business-franchise alignment.
Practical Implications – This study of business owners’ experiences and their sensemaking suggests the decision to convert to a franchise model needs to be based on a careful examination to ensure there is latitude for adjusting the self-identity to create the hybrid identity necessary to sustain business-franchise alignment. Failure to ensure awareness of what becoming a franchisor entails, the associated role changes involved, and the possible changes to the original business may cause an identity dilemma, ultimately leading to withdrawal from the franchise format. The competing set of demands from both the franchise and the business that the participants in this study experienced suggests franchise consultants should give prospective franchisors guidelines about how to best align both entities. This study challenges scholars and consultants to help prospective franchisors to understand clearly the direct link between self-identity, actions (e.g., strategic planning and practice and sensemaking) and business outcomes.
Originality/Value – This interpretive study contributes empirically to the scant literature on the experience of first franchise start-up from the franchisor’s perspective, while addressing theoretically the lack of qualitative research on franchise failure. The findings highlight how a failure to align the conventional business and franchise format, resulting in franchise termination, is caused by not anticipating and navigating a significant dilemma at the most critical time in franchise development. This has extensive practical implications. In addition, the emergent conceptual framework (featuring the concepts of franchise success/failure, strategy, self-identity, and alignment) provides a useful model for showing how the sense franchisors’ make of the experience of business-franchise alignment and reframing of self affects franchise longevity. This study also contributes to the strategy practice (SP) literature as it applies the concept of SP to the small business arena and looks at SP from the perspective of the person making a business transformation, revealing that this primary practitioner (franchisor) strategically enacts that which reinforces their sense of self during the transformation.
This thesis is original in four respects. Firstly, there is no known study which examines the narratives from three franchise groups: nascent, successful, and ceased. Secondly, despite the start-up stage being argued as the most significant stage of franchising for sustaining the franchise model, there is no known study like this doctoral study that explores this stage from the franchisors’ perspective. Thirdly, the direct impacts on the franchisors’ self-perceptions and sensemaking about transforming their business to a franchising model have, until now, been unexplored, despite the clear changes to identity and to the relationship to their original business that new franchisors report. Finally, no studies were identified that consider the relationship between franchise start-up strategy and its impact on franchise continuity. This suggests that the findings of this study offer ground-breaking insights to this field of research.

"14941","10092/839","Penke, Lara Davina",,,,,,,"2016",,"The aim of this thesis is to provide an in-depth understanding of the repatriation process in the New Zealand context, analysing various internal and external factors that have the potential to influence the re-adjustment process of returning sojourners. Most New Zealanders who sojourn in a different country eventually return to their home country. These people are then faced with a period of re-adjustment to the home country, which can cause unexpected, yet serious distress. The academic literature has offered relatively little insight into individual factors that may contribute to re-entry distress but has instead focused on cultural identity, culture shock, W-Curve or other generalised, conceptual models, which all have the inherent limitation that personal differences and individual internal and external influencing factors remain neglected in understanding the repatrion process. Numerous internal and external facets influencing an individual have been researched and shown to impact the re-entry into one’s home country after sojourning, yet existing research has made little attempt to provide an integrated approach of these facets and existing conceptual re-entry models. This dissertation provides insight into the most dominant challenges that New Zealand repatriates face after living overseas for an extended period of time taking into account individual differences.
A qualitative exploratory research design based on phenomenological interviews has been implemented to gather rich, in-depth data. Participants were invited for an interview, which commenced with a self-administered questionnaire and were then encouraged to thoroughly describe their experiences of returning to New Zealand. Participants were recruited via public notices and personal networking. The participant pool of the current study consists of 11 returned New Zealand sojourners, who had been abroad for at least 12 months and returned no longer than 12 months ago. The participant pool included eight females and three males, who all sojourned independently of each other.
The findings of this study have implications for understanding the problems sojourners face when returning to New Zealand and potential measures to assist their re-integration to their home country. The current study found that all sojourning participants experienced re-adjustment difficulties to various degrees upon returning to their home country. The differences in experienced repatriation challenges were found to be related to individual internal and external factors, which were found to serve as a valid predictor for potential re-entry distress. This research emphasises the importance of taking an integrated approach, combining the analysis of individual internal and external factors with existing repatriation theories such as the Cultural Identity theory, Culture Shock or Curve Adjustment Models. Additionally, this research proposes that further individual factors such as sojourners ‘reasons to return’ shall be incorporated into repatriation studies as they were found to be a valid predictor for potential repatriation challenges. This research offers a unique, holistic approach to analysing and understanding repatriation challenges of self-initiated sojourners in the context of New Zealand. This study further highlights the New Zealand specific re-entry challenges, which most notably include participants’ struggle with social re-adjustment due to cultural aspects such as the ‘tall poppy syndrome’. Considered together and holistically, these enduring issues of repatriation challenges have implications for the New Zealand government, education providers, employers and society at large.",,,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/12254",,,"en","English",,"University of Canterbury",,,,,"http://library.canterbury.ac.nz/thesis/etheses_copyright.shtml",,"All Rights Reserved",,,,,,,,,,,"The shock of coming home : repatriation, re-entry and re-adjustment  to New Zealand after sojourning","Theses / Dissertations",,,,,"Marketing",,"University of Canterbury",,"Masters",,,"Master of Commerce",,"2322411",,,"College of Business and Law, University of Canterbury",,,"Ldp33@me.com",,,,,,,,"Professor C.

Such behaviours are depicted in this research through workplace social inclusion, work engagement and organisational citizenship behaviour (OCB). Consequently, this research investigates the influence of workplace social inclusion on OCB with analysis on the mediating effects of work engagement and the predictive effects of demographics. Hypotheses were tested through application of a simple mediation model in accordance with Hayes Process Analysis (Hayes, 2013), alongside Hierarchical Regression Analysis for the demographic factors. Using an online survey, 109 participants’ self-reported their level of workplace social inclusion, work engagement and OCB through previously validated measures. The findings of this research were supportive of the simple mediation model. The strongest relationship was demonstrated between workplace social inclusion and work engagement. Further, once indirect relationships were considered, it was found that work engagement, a construct commonly associated with positive individual behaviour outcomes, mediated the relationship between workplace social inclusion and OCB. One of the unique contributions of this research lies in the assertion that while work engagement has been previously demonstrated as a construct closely associated with positive organisational and individual behaviours, the social context of its facilitation (through workplace social inclusion) has not been considered in prior literature to date.

country facing numerous challenges. In the 1990s, Afghanistan suffered from a disastrous
civil war. Before that, it was the site of a proxy war between the West and the Soviet Union,
resulting in the invasion of Afghanistan. As a result of numerous and ongoing conflicts, its
citizens hardly have had access to health facilities, education, clean drinking water, food,
shelter and employment in order to lead a dignified life. Things have begun to improve,
nonetheless. Since 2001, the international community has poured a large amount of
development funding into Afghanistan. One programme that has received significant
international assistance is the National Solidarity Programme (NSP) which provides basic
rights to 85 percent of communities in rural Afghanistan.
This thesis considers the human rights-based approach (HRBA) to development, with a focus
on the NSP. In particular, this thesis asks whether implementation of the NSP is consistent
with the five core principles of HRBA. These principles are: recognition of rights,
participation, empowerment, non-discrimination, and accountability and transparency. The
thesis considers whether, and to what extent, the Afghan government has been able to
embrace the HRBA while implementing the NSP. I attempt to answer this question by
drawing on the relevant literature on the NSP and interviewing different individuals who
have been involved with the design and implementation of the Programme.
While the field work indicates that the extent of application of each principle of the HRBA
varies, the study concludes that the NSP observes the hallmarks of the HRBA bar the
recognition of rights as a legal obligation, and the extent of participation from women and
persons with disabilities. These, the study argues, are largely related to the challenges of
implementing a human rights-based approach to development in a post-conflict country like
Afghanistan with a deeply conservative society.",,,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/13056",,,"en","English",,"University of Canterbury",,,,,"http://library.canterbury.ac.nz/thesis/etheses_copyright.shtml",,"All Rights Reserved",,,,,,,,,,,"Integrating a human rights-based approach in development – with a focus on Afghanistan’s National Solidarity Programme","Theses / Dissertations",,,,,"Law",,"University of Canterbury",,"Masters",,,"Master of Laws",,,,,"College of Business and Law, University of Canterbury",,,"sulaiman.sarwary@gmail.com",,,,,,,,"Natalie Baird"

In New Zealand, there has been interest in using R&D incentives to increase R&D expenditure, which hypothetically leads to better economic growth, knowledge-spillovers and the gaining of a competitive advantage with markets overseas. The reason for the increased interest in R&D perhaps most dominantly stems from an Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) R&D survey. The survey shows that in comparison with other OECD countries of comparable size New Zealand‟s R&D spending is noticeably substandard, hence, the urging importance of discovering an effective way to alter business behaviour and increase R&D spending. This necessity to increase R&D spending invites the need for R&D incentives as well as increase the volume of experimental research conducted with the resolve of better understanding the collective effects involved in utilising different R&D policy tools to cultivate R&D expenditure. With the intention of adding to the sparse, non-quantitative R&D incentive discussion, this project provides a qualitative review of prior and current R&D incentives used in New Zealand. This project further evaluates the possible effectiveness of New Zealand‟s past and current R&D incentives in terms of equity, certainty, convenience and economy. This project utilises the case study approach and the qualitative documentary analysis method to perform an exploratory study that applies Adam Smith‟s (1776) Principles of Good Taxation as an evaluation framework to assess the effectiveness of the above-mentioned incentives. The tentative findings show effectiveness according to Adam Smith‟s framework in relative ranking being: the R&D Tax Credit and R&D Cash Out of losses incentives are tied in first place, followed by the new R&D Callaghan Innovation Grants in second place.",,,,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/13057",,"en","English",,"University of Canterbury",,,,,"http://library.canterbury.ac.nz/thesis/etheses_copyright.shtml",,"All Rights Reserved",,,,,,,,,,,"A review of New Zealand’s past & current R&D incentives and how they reflect Adam Smith’s (1776) principles of good taxation : an exploratory study.","Theses / Dissertations",,,,,"Accountancy",,"University of Canterbury",,"Masters",,,"Master of Commerce",,"2406643",,,"College of Business and Law, University of Canterbury",,,"jaydeekubala@gmail.com",,,,,,,,"Alistair Hodson"

Since its incorporation in 2001 Fonterra has been the leading dairy company. It currently accounts for 95% exports of milk produced in New Zealand. Fonterra is a cooperative, and its stock can only be held by and traded among its farmer members. For this reason, the fluctuation in milk prices has a strong direct impact on farmers’ incomes, but just an indirect impact on the incomes of outside (non-farmer) investors. The Fonterra Shareholder Market is a private market and is not included in the NZX50. The aim of this project is to explore whether milk price is an additional factor that investors are exposed to in additional to other market risks that are measured by the NZX50. An augmented market model is used to explore the sensitivity between company return, the NZX50, and milk prices. A cointegration test is also conducted to examine the relationship between market return and milk return. The project finds some evidence that there was a milk price effect in the period before 2013 when the Fonterra Shareholders’ Fund was created. The Fonterra Shareholders’ Fund provides exposure to milk price risk on the NZX. The effect is a small adjustment to the usual CAPM beta.

"15861","10092/839",,"Blanchard, Carl",,,,,,"1992",,"The increased prominence of market thinking has seen many Governments liberalise 
markets that were previously tightly controlled by regulation. Similarly, these Governments 
have at the same time questioned their role in society. This questioning has seen them first 
commercialise and in some cases privatise previously publicly owned trading enterprises. All 
of these initiatives have had the objective of increasing the efficiency by which resources  are 
allocated in the economy. Liberalisation was designed to promote pricing efficiencies, while 
commercialisation and privatisation were designed to promote production and investment 
efficiencies. 


While the promotion of efficiency has been the key motivation behind these reforms, these 
same reforms provide the incentive for some industries to act inefficiently - especially those 
industries with natural monopoly characteristics. These characteristics mean that it is 
productively efficient for one firm rather than many to produce desired output. However, 
because only one firm can exist in a market, commercialisation and privatisation give that firm, 
in some cases, the ability to ""inefficiently"" price above cost. That same ability not only allows 
the monopolist to affect the operation of monopoly markets, but also ""competitive"" markets -
especially if the monopolist operats in those markets - because refusing to supply product 
essential for operation, or engagin& in other forms of discrimination, would prevent 
competition. For these reasons Governments should consider regulating those industries. 


When faced with the issue of regulation the first question a Government should ask is 
whether the monopolist can exploit. Obviously if the monopolist is threatened by entry -
whether that be nationally by replication, or internationally by importation - or consumers  can 
substitute or forgo the monopolist's product, then the monopolist does not have the power to 
exploit in any market. However, as entry barriers rise, and the dependency of customers 
increases, then the Government should consider regulation. 
Then the issue facing Government is not whether the monopolist can exploit, but the 
extent to which the monopolist can exploit. For example, if barriers to entry are slight or if 
consumers can substitute (albeit imperfectly) with another product, then this loss to society may 
not warrant the imposition of costly, less-than-perfect, regulation. In other words, imperfect 
competition will often provide greater benefits to society than will regulation  designed to 
correct these imperfections. However, as these imperfections increase, so does the likelihood 
of regulation. Regulation will seek to maximise efficiency benefits to society. 
If Government decides to regulate, then it must choose between alternative regulatory 
policies. These policies are the subject of this thesis with evaluation based on two objectives. 


First, any regulatory solution should seek to promote economic efficiency and secondly, that 
solution, where at all possible, should fit within the Government's framework of a liberalized 
""market"" economy. These tools are then applied to the recently privatised Telecom 
Corporation of New Zealand. This application, and initial regulatory evaluation, are conducted 
within a public policy rather than economics based framework. 
Based on this reasoning I have split my thesis into three sections with each section subdivided 
into chapters. The first section deals with the issues of liberalisation, 
commercialisation, privatisation and natural monopolies. Chapter 1 discusses the reasons and 
motives for liberalisation, commercialisation, and privatisation. Chapter 2 extends this 
analysis by looking at the factors that will determine when a natural monopoly exists. This 
chapter also shows how such a monopoly can best promote productive, allocative and dynamic 
efficiencies. Finally, chapter 3 considers when Governments should use regulation to promote 
efficiency - assuming a perfect world. 
With this analysis in mind, section 2 attacks the issue of regulatory options. Chapter 4 
considers the place that a threat to regulate has in the Government's regulatory armour and how 
such a threat can prevent both monopoly and competitive market exploitation. Chapter 5 
examines the place of antitrust law within the Government's regulatory framework and how 
such law retains the principles of light-handed regulation, while controlling the monopolist's 
behaviour in competitive markets. Chapter 6 contemplates the issue of price control. This 
chapter discusses how Governments can use these controls to prevent exploitation in monopoly 
markets and, to a lesser extent, predation in competitive markets. Finally, chapter 7 looks  at the issue of structural separation and how such separation can increase competitive pressure. 
Such separation can reduce the need for regulation. 
In section 3 I apply these regulatory tools to the telecommunications industry. Chapter 8 
backgrounds the industry by considering its network characteristics; natural monopoly features; 
and the path Governments have taken to liberalise the industry in New Zealand, Britain, 
Australia, and the United States. Chapter 9 details the pricing issues within the industry  and 
how a combination of light-handed controls, coupled with the threat of heavy-handed 
intervention, could effectively force cost based pricing. Chapter 10 deals with the  important 
issue of industry competition and how a competitor must interconnect with the natural 
monopoly in order to compete. To ensure connection alternative regulatory options are 
considered. Chapter 11 then looks at how the monopolist can use other practices to engage in 
anti-competitive behaviour. This chapter looks at the mechanisms by which Governments 
could control these practices. Finally, chapter 12 summarises the findings of this section.",,,,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/13066",,"en","English",,"University of Canterbury",,,,,"http://library.canterbury.ac.nz/thesis/etheses_copyright.shtml",,"All Rights Reserved",,,,,,,,,,,"Regulatory options for the privatisation of natural monopolies with particular emphasis on the privatisation of Telecom in New Zealand","Theses / Dissertations",,,,,"Accountancy",,"University of Canterbury",,"Masters",,,"Master of Commerce",,,"370775",,"College of Business and Law, University of Canterbury",,,"ucresearchrepository@canterbury.ac.nz",,,,,,,,"Lindsay Hampton"
"17651","10092/839",,"Wallace, Chloe Suzanne",,,,,,"2017",,"This thesis aims to examine the mediating role of product type (i.e., product-luxury perceptions) on consumer response to online reviews and the subsequent effect on purchase behaviour. Specifically, this thesis explicates the influence of review valence and review volume in shaping the consumers’ product evaluation, which in turn affects their purchase intentions for the focal product. An experimental design is adopted for this research. To examine the possible effects of product type and online reviews on consumer response, an online experiment based on a review website platform is conducted, using a 2×2×3 between-subjects factorial design. In the experiment, participants were exposed to one of twelve conditions involving the manipulation of the three independent variables (review valence, review volume and product type). A total of 432 participants were included in the final analyses, which were recruited via online convenience sampling on Amazon’s Mechanical Turk. Factorial ANCOVA analysis was conducted to test the hypothesised relationships. The results indicated three interaction effects between review valence, review volume and product type on consumer decision-making. A two-way interaction effect of review valence and product type, confirmed that product type mediates the influence of review valence on product attitude, product evaluation and purchase intent. Results also indicated that luxury products are less susceptible to the influence of review valence, which equates to lower purchase intentions than the non-luxury counterpart when exposed to positive reviews. A recurrent main effect of review valence was present, with results indicating a negativity bias on the perceived informative value and persuasiveness of online reviews, which was also salient in information adoption. Review volume had one main effect and tended to emerge as significant through mediating variables. Moreover, product type elicited a main effect for six dependent measures. Product involvement, susceptibility to interpersonal influence (i.e., social learning and social belonging) and materialism were found to have exogenous effects (covariates). The managerial and theoretical implications are discussed for this research, along with suggested directions for future research.",,,,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/14417",,"en","English",,"University of Canterbury",,,,,"http://library.canterbury.ac.nz/thesis/etheses_copyright.shtml",,"All Rights Reserved",,,,,,,,,,,"The electronic word-of-mouth effects of review valence, review volume, and product type on consumer purchase behaviour.",,,"Electronic Thesis or Dissertation",,,"Business Administration",,"University of Canterbury",,"Masters",,,"Master of Commerce",,"2532764",,,"College of Business and Law, University of Canterbury",,,"chloesuzanne8@gmail.com",,,,,,,,"Professor Paul Ballantine"
"15251","10092/839",,"Roy, Hiran",,,,,,"2016",,"Restaurants and chefs have been recognised as potentially influential actors in efforts to promote local food systems. Yet their role is not well documented in academic literature. Using a pragmatic paradigm and comparative study approaches, this research examines foodservice establishments (hereby restaurants and chefs) perceptions, motivations, barriers and constraints in buying and promoting local food ingredients on their menus from local suppliers (hereby farmers and/or farmers’ market vendors and wholesale distributors) in Vancouver (Canada) and Christchurch (New Zealand). This research also examines farmers and/or farmers’ market vendors and wholesale distributors perceived barriers and constraints to working with restaurants and chefs. To date studies that examine farmers and/or farmers’ market vendors and wholesale distributors’ perspectives on the benefits and barriers to marketing local products and supply relationships directly to local restaurants are lacking. This study investigated these aspects using a mail survey of foodservice establishments (restaurants and chefs) complemented by in-depth semi-structured interviews with restaurants and chefs, farmers and/or farmers’ market vendors, and wholesale distributors. A mail survey was administered with 759 establishments in Vancouver and 455 establishments in Christchurch. Interviews were conducted with 31 restaurants and chefs, 12 farmers and/farmers’ market vendors, and six wholesale distributors in Vancouver. In Christchurch interviews were conducted with 28 restaurants and chefs, eight farmers and/or farmers’ market vendors, and ten wholesale distributors.
The research found differences in local food perceptions, buying and/or selling experiences and perceived benefits and/or motivations and obstacles with local food sourcing activities. The results indicated Vancouver and Christchurch restaurants and chefs have a favourable attitude towards the purchase of local food products through farmers, farmers’ market vendors, and wholesale distributors, though there is no consensus on what local means. The results also indicated that restaurants and chefs most preferred method of purchasing local food was through wholesale distributors in both samples because of the convenience with respect to time, price, quality, customer services, and logistics issues, while price fluctuations and the on-time delivery of products were mentioned as obstacles for sourcing from wholesale distributors by restaurants and chefs. Common barriers for purchasing local foods from farmers for restaurants and chefs and wholesale distributors included inconsistent quality, inadequate availability, and transportation and delivery logistics. Whereas, larger time commitment to source locally was revealed as the major barrier to restaurants and chefs not purchasing locally in both samples. However, the higher price of products was reported as an obstacle by restaurants and chefs.
Barriers in selling to local restaurants and chefs by farmers and farmers’ market vendors included small volume and placing the orders on-time, delivery costs, and cost of production; while, restaurants and chefs satisfaction with local wholesale distributors have created new opportunities for farmers to work collaboratively with them in including more local food products in their distribution channel. Stakeholders described economic factors, social interactions, and social-emotional goals for participating in local food systems. The findings demonstrated that relationship building with local farmers that allowed trust building over time appeared to be the key factor that affects local food purchasing decisions for restaurants and chefs and wholesale distributors in both study areas. Establishing personal relationships emerged as the primary reason reported by farmers for selling in the region. Several important distinctions of benefits and/or motivations also emerged between stakeholder groups. Restaurants and chefs and wholesale distributors were motivated by a desire to obtain fresher products and higher quality products in their purchasing decisions of local foods. The other reasons wholesale distributors favoured purchasing in region were customer demand, supplier loyalty, and faster availability of the products associated with shorter transport distances. From the perspective of farmers and/or farmers’ market vendors strategies for selling regionally were personal satisfaction, products appreciation, and being paid fairly for products.
Results reveal that chefs are opinion leaders; chefs utilise wait staff, menu descriptions, and other form of communication tools (e.g. social media) to promote local foods to their customers in both samples. The study further indicated that local foods have an important role in the culinary tourism experience. Research results also revealed the most significant differences between Vancouver and Christchurch respondents in relation to their suppliers’ performance in terms of: guaranteed consistent of product quality, food safety assurances, ability to deliver quantity needed or ordered, and convenience in order process.
The major implication of the findings is that farmers need to give greater attention to volume requirements, delivery schedules, food safety assurance, information about product availability, and develop trust-based relationships with their buyers to create better market access for local foods. Policy makers can also help in facilitating food localisation. Furthermore, restaurants and chefs should be engaged in educating their staff about local food if they want to increase their sales and awareness of local foods. Finally, the findings highlighted the relationships between hospitality businesses and wholesale distributors in the local food system which is yet to be significantly captured in the hospitality and local food literature.",,,,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/12694",,"en","English",,"University of Canterbury",,,,,"http://library.canterbury.ac.nz/thesis/etheses_copyright.shtml",,"All Rights Reserved",,,,,,,,,,,"The role of local food in restaurants: a comparison between restaurants and chefs in Vancouver, Canada and Christchurch, New Zealand","Theses / Dissertations",,,,"Business Administration",,,"University of Canterbury",,"Doctoral",,,"Doctor of Philosophy",,"2365387",,,"College of Business and Law, University of Canterbury",,,"blueroy6@hotmail.com",,,,,,,,"Professor C.

"13896","10092/839",,"Poole, Anthony Richard",,,,,,"1964",,"The scope of this study of the New Zealand economy
during the late 1930s has been delineated by two factors -
the availability of statistical information, and the title
of the thesis.
There is a lack of useful statistical information
about the New Zealand economy in the 1930s. In particular,
there are no figures available for the tertiary industries,
including the wholesale and retail trade, and so a study of
this sector of the economy, important though it is, has not
been attempted. Similarly, the direction that each sector
study takes differs from one sector to another, and was
determined by what statistics were available for each particular.
ar sector. All the figures presented have been taken
from the original sources quoted, except for the series
for the volume of production, and the productivity, of secondary
industry. Both of these were supplied by Mr.W.Rosenberg,
the former being supplied to him by the Department
of Statistics, and the latter being calculated by Mr Rosenberg
on the basis of the former series.
No sector studied in the course of this thesis has been
studied in great detail, firstly because of the lack of
available information, and secondly because an estimation
of the effectiveness or otherwise of the Labour Government's
policy for economic recovery does not require a highly detailed
sector study. Similarly, no attempt has been made to
find parallelisms between economic situations or policy in
the 130s and the '6os, as this too would be irrelevant.
It has been necessary, however, to extend the overall study
back to about 1930, in order to get a suitable base year.
Neither the end of 1935, (when the Labour Government came to
power) nor 1932 (the trough of the depression) were suitable
dates from which to start a study of economic recovery, in that there would have been no indication of how complete
recovery was.
The thesis has been presented in three sections - the
narrative, supported by graphs, and by tables. The narrative
comes first, followed by the graphs and tables in that order.
Each section has been cross-referenced to the other two, and
no difficulty should be experienced in moving freely from
one section to another as required.",,,,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/11953",,"en","English",,"University of Canterbury",,,,,"http://library.canterbury.ac.nz/thesis/etheses_copyright.shtml",,"All Rights Reserved",,,,,,,,,,,"The first Labour Government and New Zealand's recovery from depression","Theses / Dissertations",,,,,"Economics",,"University of Canterbury",,"Masters",,,"Master of Commerce",,,"383887",,"College of Business and Law, University of Canterbury",,,"ucresearchrepository@canterbury.ac.nz",,,,,,,,

In this paper I have undertaken to recount the story of that earlier development, together with its antecedents, as it appeared in those official publications of the successive Parliaments from 1860 to 1875 found in the Appendix to the Journals of the House of Representatives of New Zealand. I have limited my subject by omitting the tremendous question of land policy, although recognizing fully its influence on the state and economy of New Zealand. Too many factors enter into that problem for it to be viewed meaningfully from the economic angle alone. I have sought to record, often in the words of the participants, the relationship between. government and private enterprise however it appeared in the documents. The early years contributed little, since the colony was young, responsible government even younger. Official energies were largely concentrated on land acquisition and attendant difficulties with the Maoris. Permissory acts for corporations and emergency regulations ware typical manifestations of that relationship before 1870. The first extended contact recorded was that between successive administrations and the Bank of New Zealand, in which the former assumed the same position as a private firm of equal economic importance might have assumed toward its banking agent. Government participation in private enterprise fields began with the program of public works of the 1870’s, which testified to a change in administrative concepts; the central government was no longer the arbiter of the economy, but its leader. It built railroads and imported labor, it encouraged diversification and increase of industry, both primary and secondary, it strove to break the power of English monopolies over the colony. Those who have written about New Zealand's history have tended to consider this development an aberration from British economic thought of the nineteenth century, requiring explanation or defense. Two economists who were in a position to influence the colonists, however, distinguished between government in a developed, “overpopulated” country such as England, and administration of the empty spaces of a new land, providing theoretical justification for an active policy in the latter circumstances.  Government construction of public works was no innovation in the Australasian colonies. On the continent, the separate colonies had faced the question of private or state railroads already and generally had settled on the latter. New Zealand's own provinces, not private enterprise, had built the colony's original telegraph lines and railroads as their finances permitted. This history of the shift from provincial enterprise to that of the colony as a whole follows.",,,,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/12748",,"en","English",,"University of Canterbury",,,,,"http://library.canterbury.ac.nz/thesis/etheses_copyright.shtml",,"All Rights Reserved",,,,,,,,,,,"Relations of government and private enterprise in New Zealand, 1860-1875 : a documentary study.","Theses / Dissertations",,,,,"Economics",,"University of Canterbury",,"Masters",,,"Master of Arts",,,"337998",,"College of Business and Law, University of Canterbury",,,"ucresearchrepository@canterbury.ac.nz",,,,,,,,
"15925","10092/839",,"Collins, Toni Leah",,,,,,"2016",,"The Canterbury earthquakes in 2010 and 2011 had a significant impact on landlords and tenants of commercial buildings in the city of Christchurch. The devastation wrought on the city was so severe that in an unprecedented response to this disaster a cordon was erected around the central business district for nearly two and half years while demolition, repairs and rebuilding took place. Despite the destruction, not all buildings were damaged. Many could have been occupied and used immediately if they had not been within the cordoned area. Others had only minor damage but repairs to them could not be commenced, let alone completed, owing to restrictions on access caused by the cordon. Tenants were faced with a major problem in that they could not access their buildings and it was likely to be a long time before they would be allowed access again. The other problem was uncertainty about the legal position as neither the standard form leases in use, nor any statute, provided for issues arising from an inaccessible building. The parties were therefore uncertain about their legal rights and obligations in this situation. Landlords and tenants were unsure whether tenants were required to pay rent for a building that could not be accessed or whether they could terminate their leases on the basis that the building was inaccessible.
This thesis looks at whether the common law doctrine of frustration could apply to leases in these circumstances, where the lease had made no provision. It analyses the history of the doctrine and how it applies to a lease, the standard form leases in use at the time of the earthquakes and the unexpected and extraordinary nature of the earthquakes. It then reports on the findings of the qualitative empirical research undertaken to look at the experiences of landlords and tenants after the earthquakes. It is argued that the circumstances of landlords and tenants met the test for the doctrine of frustration. Therefore, the doctrine could have applied to leases to enable the parties to terminate them. It concludes with a suggestion for reform in the form of a new Act to govern the special relationship between commercial landlords and tenants, similar to legislation already in place covering other types of relationships like those in residential tenancies and employment. Such legislation could provide dispute resolution services to enable landlords and tenants to have access to justice to determine their legal rights at all times, and in particular, in times of crisis.",,,,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/13166",,"en","English",,"University of Canterbury",,,,,"http://library.canterbury.ac.nz/thesis/etheses_copyright.shtml",,"All Rights Reserved",,,,,,,,,,,"The doctrine of frustration, commercial leases and the Canterbury earthquakes","Theses / Dissertations",,,,,"Law",,"University of Canterbury",,"Doctoral",,,"Doctor of Philosophy",,"2409747",,,"College of Business and Law, University of Canterbury",,,"lindo@xtra.co.nz",,,,,,,,"Professor Jeremy Finn"
"15910","10092/839",,"Crook, Kimberley",,,,,,"1998",,"This thesis examines the conceptual distinction between liabilities and equity, in the 
context of business entities, by means of a literature review. It is shown that the conceptual 
distinction between liabilities and equity requires consideration of the underlying equity 
theory. Various equity theories are compared, including the entity, proprietary and residual 
equity theories, which each view liabilities and equity, and the distinction between the 
two, differently. In addition to these well-known equity theories, another equity theory is 
presented, that has received little specific attention as an equity theory in the literature, but 
nevertheless appears to have considerable support. This other theory is termed the noncompulsion 
equity theory for the purposes of this thesis. Despite the support from the 
accounting literature, it is shown that the non-compulsion equity theory appears to have 
little support from either the law or the economics literature. Given that accounting takes 
place in the wider legal and economic environment, this suggests that the non-compulsion 
equity theory may not be an appropriate basis for distinguishing between liabilities and 
equity. A review of the accounting conceptual statements reveals that they are inconsistent 
in their application of an underlying equity theory, because they use several equity theories 
rather than one, including the non-compulsion equity theory, which is adopted by the 
conceptual statements' definitions of liabilities and equity. A closer examination of the 
non-compulsion equity theory demonstrates that it is based upon inconsistent reasoning 
and questionable assumptions, suggesting that it is fundamentally flawed. This thesis 
concludes by rejecting the non-compulsion equity theory as a basis for distinguishing 
between liabilities and equity, suggesting that a new approach is required. The residual 
equity theory seems likely to provide a suitable alternative.",,,,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/13107",,"en","English",,"University of Canterbury",,,,,"http://library.canterbury.ac.nz/thesis/etheses_copyright.shtml",,"All Rights Reserved",,,,,,,,,,,"The conceptual distinction between liabilities and equity : a new approach required","Theses / Dissertations",,,,,"Accountancy",,"University of Canterbury",,"Masters",,,"Master of Commerce",,,"652364",,"College of Business and Law, University of Canterbury",,,"ucresearchrepository@canterbury.ac.nz",,,,,,,,"Sue Newberry"

setters, known as G4+ 1, has released two special reports on reporting financial performance

Directions written by Todd Johnson and Andrew Lennard (Johnson and Lennard,  1998) and 
Reporting Financial Performance-A Proposed Approach written by Kathryn Cearns (Cearns,

process, the proposals made in these two reports have important implications for future 
accounting practices in respect of reporting financial performance. Therefore it is important to 
understand and examine the conceptual basis of the proposals made in the two reports for its 
consistency and validity. The purpose of this research is to examine the income concepts 
underlying the proposals. It is conducted by a way of literature review. Several theoretical 
concepts of income have been identified and compared with the details of the proposals made 
in the reports. The four concepts of income identified are: the concept of service value 
income, the concept of business venture income, the concept of comprehensive income and 
the concept of value added income. The results of the examination show that, at the overall 
level, both reports have adopted an approach to reporting financial performance that is 
consistent with the concept of comprehensive income. At the detailed level, it seems that the 
concept of service value income has been adopted for developing the proposed performance 
statement. Based on this finding, this research discusses the inconsistencies between the 
underlying income concepts identified and the appropriateness of adopting the concepts. To 
the extent that the inconsistencies are concerned, this research paper also provides suggestions

"15975","10092/839","Salehifar, Alireza",,,,,,,"2016",,"For several years Article 25 of the Model Tax Convention of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development on Income and on Capital (the OECD Model Tax Convention), and Article 25 of the United Nations Model Double Taxation Convention between Developed and Developing Countries (the UN Model Tax Convention) had relied only on a negotiation-based Mutual Agreement Procedure (MAP) as the only mechanism for the resolution of disputes arising from a tax treaty. The MAP, thus, refers to the process of mutual negotiation between tax administrations of the two treaty partners of a Double Tax Agreement (DTA).  In this respect, the above model tax conventions have instructed that treaty partners should “endeavour” to resolve their tax disputes through the MAP. Thus, the model tax conventions did not contain any binding legal instrument which could require the treaty partners to finally reach an agreement for the resolution of tax disputes.
As a result of this, serious questions have been raised as to the efficiency of the MAP in recent years, leading the OECD to openly acknowledge that there are situations in which cases could not be satisfactorily decided under the MAP process.  In order to improve the function of the MAP mechanism, the OECD, in 2008, and the UN Tax Committee, in 2011, have introduced a binding ad hoc arbitration clause in Article 25(5) of their respective model tax conventions. However, the OECD and UN model tax conventions have recognised a very limited role for arbitration in resolving tax treaty disputes. If the treaty partners, during a MAP process, fail to come to an agreement about certain issues within a specific period of time, only then, those unresolved issues can be submitted to arbitration. Arbitration is, therefore, seen as an extension of the MAP process, not as a stand-alone and independent instrument for the resolution of cross-border tax disputes. 
After establishing that the inclusion of the current arbitration clauses in the OECD and UN model tax conventions have not assuaged the tensions created by divergent interpretation or application of rules espoused in DTAs, this thesis examines possible techniques for improving the dispute resolution system of DTAs and makes suggestions to improve that process.",,,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/13294",,,"en","English",,"University of Canterbury",,,,,"http://library.canterbury.ac.nz/thesis/etheses_copyright.shtml",,"All Rights Reserved",,,,,,,,,,,"Towards a more effective dispute settlement system in tax treaties.","Theses / Dissertations",,,,,,,"University of Canterbury",,"Doctoral",,,"Doctor of Philosophy",,,,,"College of Business and Law, University of Canterbury",,,"salehyfar@gmail.com",,,,,,,,"Professor Adrian Sawyer"
"13970","10092/839",,"Brook, James Robert",,,,,,"2016",,"Native Advertising is an emerging and contemporary trend in marketing, but there has been very little empirical research conducted in this area. The concept of Native Advertising provides a less intrusive gateway for advertisers to bypass other peripheral advertising clutter, and engage with the consumer on a level previously dismissed by marketers. With the Link-Click nature of the internet (Cramer, 2015), consumers are more willing to learn about products that interest them if they are being entertained or believe they are becoming better informed about relevant topics. However, a majority of the regulatory power is at the discretion of the corporate sponsor. Currently, it may be argued that the purpose of news is to inform readers of what they should know regarding current affairs. Due to the underlying intentions of some corporate sponsors, the purpose may shift towards informing readers to what they want to know regarding products and brands, which could have consumer welfare implications. The boundary between these two types of news is ill-distinguished, due to the modernistic and ever-evolving nature of this concept paired with the blurring of the line between editorial and advertising. In general, most publishers feature labels for Sponsored Content; however, in some instances, this label can be missed due to its subtlety or simple overlooked in terms of understanding what it indicates. Therefore, the reader may be subjugated to believe it is written by a journalist as an independent news article and may experience deception leading towards reduced evaluations of the parties involved. This research aims to examine reader reactions to Sponsored Content Native Advertising news articles and explore contributing elements.",,,,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/12002",,"en","English",,"University of Canterbury",,,,,"http://library.canterbury.ac.nz/thesis/etheses_copyright.shtml",,"All Rights Reserved",,,,,,,,,,,"The social marketing impact of native advertising news articles and the influence of scepticism from consumers.","Theses / Dissertations",,,,,"Business Administration",,"University of Canterbury",,"Masters",,,"Master of Commerce",,"2273390",,,"College of Business and Law",,,"jamesrobertbrook@gmail.com",,,,,,,,"Associate Professor Ekant Veer"
"14037","10092/839",,"Tan, Andrew James",,,,,,"2016",,"This thesis explores how social entrepreneurship develops following a crisis. A review of literature finds that despite more than 15 years of academic attention, a common definition of social entrepreneurship remains elusive, with the field lacking the unified framework to set it apart as a specialised field of study. There are a variety of different conceptualisations of how social entrepreneurship works, and what it aims to achieve. The New Zealand context for social entrepreneurship is explored, finding that it receives little attention from the government and education sectors, despite its enormous potential.
A lack of readily available information on social entrepreneurship leads most studies to investigate it as a phenomenon, and given the unique context of this research, it follows suit. Following from several authors’ recommendations that social entrepreneurship be subjected to further exploration, this is an exploratory, inductive study. A multiple case study is used to explore how social entrepreneurship develops following a natural disaster, using the example of the February 2011 earthquake in Christchurch, New Zealand. With little existing theory in this research area, this method is used to provide interesting examples of how the natural disaster, recognised as a crisis, can lead to business formation.
Findings revealed the crisis initially triggered an altruistic response from social entrepreneurs, leading them to develop newly highlighted opportunities that were related to fields in which they had existing skills and expertise. In the process of developing these opportunities, initial altruistic motivations faded, with a new focus on the pursuit of a social mission and aims for survival and growth. The social missions addressed broad issues, and while they did address the crisis to differing extents, they were not confined to addressing its consequences. A framework is presented to explain how social entrepreneurship functions, once triggered in response to crisis.
This framework supports existing literature that depicts social entrepreneurship as a continuous process, and illustrates the effects of a crisis as the catalyst for social business formation. In the aftermath of a crisis, when resources are likely to be scarce, social entrepreneurs play a significant role in the recovery process and their contributions should be highly valued both by government and relevant disaster response bodies. Policies that support social entrepreneurs and their ventures should be considered in the same way as commercial ventures.",,,,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/12027",,"en","English",,"University of Canterbury",,,,,"http://library.canterbury.ac.nz/thesis/etheses_copyright.shtml",,"All Rights Reserved",,,,,,,,,,,"Social entrepreneurship as a response to disaster: An examination of cases following the February 2011 Christchurch earthquake","Theses / Dissertations",,,,"Business Administration",,,"University of Canterbury",,"Masters",,,"Master of Commerce",,"2315118",,,"College of Business and Law, University of Canterbury",,,"ajtan@me.com",,,,,,,,"Dr. Sussie Morrish"
"13932","10092/839","Petrie, Nathan",,,,,,,"2016",,"This thesis aims to provide some coverage of the increasingly important marketing area of Electronic Word of Mouth from a different angle to that provided thus far in the marketing literature. The primary aim of this research is to provide an understanding of the nature of product and service oriented Electronic Word of Mouth messages conveyed via the social media platform Instagram. The already noted power of Word of Mouth as a communication form coupled with the unique properties of Instagram as a communication platform provide a highly useful basis for contribution to the marketing domain.
Unlike some previous Word of Mouth oriented studies, this research chose to employ a content analysis methodology in order to examine the Instagram based Word of Mouth communication. This approach enabled the communication itself to be placed as the focus of the research whilst also enabling that communication to be examined in its native and unadulterated state. To implement the content analysis, a total of one thousand Instagram posts featuring the four product and service based categories of Cars, Clothes, Restaurants and Holidays were sampled. The content from these posts was then analysed using a coding scheme comprising of the four content themes of Emotive Content, Company Linking, Commercial Intent Content and Recommendation Content. The variance in these four content themes between the four product and service based categories was then calculated as per the research hypotheses. Additionally, the frequencies for the different content measurement units for each of the content themes was recorded along with the different forms of image used in the posts sampled from each of the four product and service categories.
Ultimately, many of the variance results failed to support the research hypotheses, however the presence of other statistically significant results and in some cases the absence of significant results did provide some useful alternative findings. In the sole case that the research hypothesis was supported, the results indicated that Instagram posts featuring the service categories of Restaurants and Holidays featured a higher level of Recommendation Content than those featuring Cars and Clothing. These results, coupled with the frequency results for both the image types and content measurement units enabled the three broader research themes of the prominence of emotion, relative focus on self and lack of commercialisation to be derived.
The implications of the study in both theoretical and practical terms, along with the limitations of the study and subsequent suggestions for future research are also discussed.",,,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/11922",,,"en","English",,"University of Canterbury",,,,,"http://library.canterbury.ac.nz/thesis/etheses_copyright.shtml",,"All Rights Reserved",,,,,,,,,,,"Consumer to Consumer Marketing: Understanding the Nature of Product and Service Oriented Electronic Word of Mouth Communication Via Instagram","Theses / Dissertations",,,,,,,"University of Canterbury",,"Masters",,,"Master of Commerce",,,,,"College of Business and Law, University of Canterbury",,,"nathan.petrie@schema-world.com",,,,,,,,"Associate Professor David Fortin"

"13962","10092/839",,"Kipp, Robert David",,,,,,"2016",,"In this dissertation it is argued that the Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Act 2011 and the Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Authority were both necessary and inevitable given the trends and traditions of civil defence emergency management (CDEM) in New Zealand. The trends and traditions of civil defence are such that principles come before practice, form before function, and change is primarily brought about through crisis and criticism. The guiding question of the research was why were a new governance system and law made after the Canterbury earthquakes in 2010 and 2011? Why did this outcome occur despite the establishment of a modern emergency management system in 2002 which included a recovery framework that had been praised by international scholars as leading edge and a model for other countries? The official reason was the unprecedented scale and demands of the recovery – but a disaster of such scale is the principle reason for having a national emergency management system. Another explanation is the lack of cooperation among local authorities – but that raises the question of whether the CDEM recovery framework would have been successful in another locality. Consequentially, the focus of this dissertation is on the CDEM recovery framework and how New Zealand came to find itself making disaster law during a disaster. Recommendations include a review of emergency powers for recovery, a review of the capabilities needed to fulfil the mandate of Recovery Managers, and the establishment of a National Recovery Office with a cadre of Recovery Managers that attend every recovery to observe, advise, or assume control as needed. CDEM Group Recovery Managers would be seconded to the National Recovery Office which would allow for experience in recovery management to be developed and institutionalised through regular practice.",,,,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/11989",,"en","English",,"University of Canterbury",,,,,"http://library.canterbury.ac.nz/thesis/etheses_copyright.shtml",,"All Rights Reserved",,,,,,,,,,,"From Cold War to Canterbury: The New Zealand Experience in Emergency Management","Theses / Dissertations",,,,,"Law",,"University of Canterbury",,"Doctoral",,,"Doctor of Philosophy",,"2272662",,,"College of Business and Law, University of Canterbury",,,"robert.kipp@gmail.com",,,,,,,,"Associate Professor John Hopkins ; Professor Elizabeth Toomey"

In this research, we adopt Agency Theory and Weill’s IT Governance framework to investigate the decision priorities of senior executives in the context of IS resilience planning. IS resilience planning falls under the broader umbrella of IT governance and on an aspect of organisational resilience, that is, on Information Systems (IS) resilience. To the best of our knowledge, there is no study focusing on understanding the decision-making process of senior executives in relation to IS resilience. Although research has been undertaken on the topics of organisational resilience, and IT governance, there is a gap in the literature with respect to IS resilience. This research employ Agency theory combined with Weill’s IT Governance framework to develop a conceptual framework, focused on decision-making and planning for IS resilience.
Concourse theory and Q-methodology were used to develop a Q-sort questionnaire, which was refined through interviews with researchers, decision makers from large and small organisations and IS professionals. For the purpose of this research 37 statements were sorted by key decision makers of the Jade Software Corporation, a large private organisation in New Zealand. We report a case study of the Jade, in which we have used Q-methodology to develop a typology of decision priorities for IS resilience planning. The Q-methodology is preferred in research where subjective opinion is to be explored with the goal of developing a typology, since it correlates the individual viewpoints of people rather than correlating variables selected in advance by the researchers. After the senior executives at Jade sorted the Q-statements, in-depth qualitative interviews were conducted to better understand their decision priorities. Detailed analysis revealed two types of decision makers in top management team, each representing a unique perspective of IS resilience. These types are discussed, along with 7
implications of findings, a theoretical framework for IS resilience, and suggestions for future research.
This research also presents an in-depth case study of Jade adapting in the aftermath of a crisis, lessons learnt from them and also proposes a model for IS resilience planning based on IT governance framework. Moreover, this study shows how Q-Methodology can deepen our understanding of top management decision priorities in context to IS resilience planning, especially in crisis situation, addressing the general question: “How do senior executives in organisations make decisions under crisis situation and how do they prioritise their decisions to ensure IS resilience within their organisation?” It also asks the specific question: “How do senior executives at Jade Software Corporation make decisions under crisis situation and how do they prioritise their decisions to ensure IS resilience at Jade Software Corporation?” Given the potentially devastating implications of disruptions to organisations, understanding the dynamics of the successful adaption of IS within organisations indicates an important avenue for future research.

People have seen and recognised the direct impact on the environment from their consumption behaviour and activities (Gan, Wee, Ozanne, & Kao, 2008). Also, researchers have conducted valuable scientific studies and suggested a change of current unsustainable consumption to reduce the negative impact for future well-being (European Environment Agency, 2015). Most prior research has focused on general consumer behaviour, behavioural intentions, and willingness to pay; or they have focused on green consumer behaviour for a single behaviour type or single product category in more-developed economies. A gap exists in the literature with regards to understanding green consumers’ attitudes and actual behaviours, and understanding consumers from outside the developed Western cultures.
The aim of this research is to explore and compare green consumers’ pro-environmental attitudes and actual behaviours, including both New Zealand and Chinese green consumers. An exploratory qualitative and grounded theory approach were adopted. Twenty green consumers were interviewed in Christchurch for this research, and their pro-environmental activities and green purchasing behaviour were investigated. This study found two influencers affect consumers’ attitudes; they are important life events and knowledge. Three motivational factors were identified; they are the environmental concern, personal benefits, and a sense of environmental responsibility and obligation. Several consumption barriers and strategies were explored in relation to green purchasing behaviour. The motivation for repetitive purchasing behaviour was also explored. A Green Consumer Consumption Model was developed and provided. In addition, several cultural differences were found between New Zealand and Chinese green consumers. This research contributes to consumer behaviour and green marketing literature. Also, this research could provide practical insights for manufacturers, green marketers, and policymakers; those insights could be used as valuable feedback to help them develop effective marketing strategies and policies and to bring value-return in the long-term view.",,,,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/12812",,"en","English",,"University of Canterbury",,,,,"http://library.canterbury.ac.nz/thesis/etheses_copyright.shtml",,"All Rights Reserved",,,,,,,,,,,"A comparison of New Zealand and Chinese consumers’ pro-environmental attitudes and behaviours.","Theses / Dissertations",,,,,"Marketing",,"University of Canterbury",,"Masters",,,"Master of Commerce",,"2381081",,,"College of Business and Law, University of Canterbury",,,"beccazen88@gmail.com",,,,,,,,"Associate Professor Lucie Kathleen Ozanne"
"9949","10092/839","Mueller, Jens Helmut Friedrich",,,,,,,"2014",,"This research interrogates a large population of shareholders, senior managers and company directors in New Zealand as to their reasons for considering board service, their competence in governance skills areas, their beliefs as to whether board room diversity is needed and their firms’ interests to recruit further independent directors to their boards.

With a considerable deference to the contributions of agency theory as the conventional cornerstone to explain the connection of directors into organizations for the purpose of governance service, this work explores the extension of agency theory by adding an additional driver for governance engagement by company directors: Commitment. Based on this research, company directors in New Zealand appear to base their interest in serving as independent directors on company boards largely on the desire to “do good”. This raises the prospect of a deeper and more meaningful relationship with firms where they serve as directors. Ignorance of this important component of the director/firm relationship by the firms might render directors less willing to contribute and deprive firms of the strong support and engagement of their directors.  Lack of recognition of this additional component to the fabric of an enduring committed relationship between external directors and their firms may require a different behavior of firms during the recruitment, board induction training and maintenance of the director relationship.

While the strong expression of interest by SMEs in additional independent directors is a welcome sign of rising governance standards in New Zealand’s large group of such enterprises, concern emerges about the potential lack of competence by directors in several areas of governance. While directors appear to compensate for deficiencies in skills with an extra dose of commitment, significant needs for upskilling exists in this sector. It is noted that the absence of well-established, easily accessible and comprehensive director training schemes in New Zealand conflicts with the expected large number of additional independent director recruitments in the near future.

Shareholders, senior managers and directors report a need for diversity on boards in the area of business experience, but no specific concern is expressed as to how any specific importance of gender or age while other factors, such as work experience and global knowledge, are of much greater interest. This could indicate that the status quo of only a small number of women on boards in New Zealand is accepted, but in the context of this work more likely indicates that directors will not be recruited (or excluded from recruitment) in the future on the basis of gender.

This research attempts to lay groundwork for a more intensive investigation into the true motivations of company directors when they think of an independent director mandate and while they discharge directorship duties. There now appears to be solid evidence that the historic application of agency theory does not completely describe the factors of motivation and relationship under which independent directors serve on company boards.",,,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/8963",,,"en",,,"University of Canterbury.

An important objective of the New Zealand public sector reforms that started in the late 1980s, was to focus the attention of public servants on clear specified results rather than bureaucratic procedures. Based on an implicit assumption that all public sector organisations are of a production nature, the reforms promised greater efficiency within the public sector by holding managers accountable for results while providing them with greater freedom to allocate resources. Consequently, outputs became key performance measures to enhance the accountability structure and to improve efficiency of the public organizations. The development of performance measurements to date appears inadequate in that the most important component of results   outcomes is overlooked from the measurement.    Currently government departments in New Zealand are implementing the early stage of the Management for Outcomes initiative, with an aim of ensuring all public service departments adopt a more strategic and outcome-focused approach to management and reporting. This thesis studied the latest developments in using outputs as performance measures in two public organisations. The findings demonstrates that outputs do not indicate performance for a procedural or a coping organisation as output information may not be relevant, meaningful or useful. However the most significant risk is that just as in the past, reliance on outputs will continue to lead to the fragmentation of public services and the ineffective delivery of services that the Management for Outcomes initiative aims to overcome.",,,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/855",,,"en",,,"University of Canterbury.

"15976","10092/839",,"Jone, Melinda",,,,,,"2016",,"Dispute systems design (DSD) refers to a deliberate effort to identify and improve the way an organisation addresses conflict by decisively and strategically arranging its dispute resolution processes. A number of principles have been put forward by various DSD practitioners for best practice in effective DSD. These principles emanate from the six fundamental DSD principles proposed by the seminal theorists Ury, Brett and Goldberg in Getting Disputes Resolved: Designing Systems to Cut the Costs of Conflict in 1988. To date, tax dispute resolution is an area that has not been extensively examined utilising DSD principles. However, with the recent trend of some tax authorities towards employing interests-based dispute resolution procedures, namely, various forms of alternative dispute resolution (ADR) processes, the application of DSD principles in the context of tax dispute resolution arguably warrants greater research.
  
 
The purpose of this study is to develop the application of DSD principles in the particular context of tax dispute resolution. Utilising a comparative case study methodology, 14 DSD principles drawn from the literature have been used to evaluate the effectiveness of the design of the current tax dispute resolution processes of the jurisdictions of New Zealand (NZ), Australia, the United Kingdom (UK) and the United States (US). Through comparing the DSD evaluations conducted, this study has sought to develop a set of tax DSD principles to be adapted by tax administrations and used in either developing new or improving existing tax dispute resolution systems. Semi-structured interviews with 30 selected stakeholders in NZ have then been conducted in order to externally evaluate the tax DSD principles developed and also consider whether adaption of the principles is required in the context of the NZ tax dispute resolution procedures.  

 
The findings from the case studies indicate that the 14 DSD principles from the literature can generally be applied in the tax dispute resolution context without significant substantive modification. The interview findings suggest that the overarching design principle which must be borne in mind in the design of any tax dispute resolution system is that the system must be fair and perceived as fair. However, there is insufficient support from the interviews to justify any concrete changes being made to the tax DSD principles developed from the case studies. Thus, the interview findings are limited to the making of suggestions for certain modifications to the tax DSD principles potentially being made. Therefore, further research is necessary in order to confirm or refute the suggested changes. The interview findings further indicate that the tax DSD principles developed do not require adaptation specifically for NZ. Although, this may in part be due to the sample of participants interviewed being drawn only from NZ.  

 
Against the background of the overarching design principle of fairness, this study has a wide ranging applicability to tax administrations and their stakeholders in developing or improving their tax dispute resolution systems.",,,,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/13293",,"en","English",,"University of Canterbury",,,,,"http://library.canterbury.ac.nz/thesis/etheses_copyright.shtml",,"All Rights Reserved",,,,,,,,,,,"Tax dispute systems design : international  comparisons and the development of guidance from  a New Zealand perspective.",,"Theses / Dissertations",,,,"Accountancy",,"University of Canterbury",,"Doctoral",,,"Doctor of Philosophy",,"2467108",,,"College of Business and Law, University of Canterbury",,,"Melinda.jone@pg.canterbury.ac.nz",,,,,,,,"Professor Adrian Sawyer"
"1183","10092/839",,,"Anderson, Warwick Wyndham",,,,,"2006",,"This thesis investigates the nature of joint dividend-and-earnings signalling in announcements to the New Zealand Stock Exchange in the 1990s. Initially the Market Model is used to compute expected returns, and the abnormal returns derived from these are subjected to restricted least squares regressions to separate out a putative dividend signal from the concurrent earnings signal. But with the Market Model, the zero-value company returns associated with an absence of trading in thinly traded stocks are over-represented in returns distributions leading to problems of bias. New models are developed that explicitly exploit zero returns. The first alternative methodology entails friction modelling, which uses a maximum likelihood estimation procedure to find the relationship coefficients and the range of returns that  should  be considered as zero, and then proceeds to treat them as a separate category. The second alternative methodology is that of state asset models, which take a fresh new look at investor perceptions of the connection between movements in company returns and those of the concurrent underlying market. Zero-value company returns cease to be zero in value, where a state model is rotated, or alternatively they can be modelled as an extra state. All three methodologies furnish some evidence of dividend signalling; but this evidence is highly dependent on small changes within the given methodology.",,,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/861",,,"en",,,"University of Canterbury.

In particular, a dramatic change in the pattern of cash flows by individual and institutional investors is documented. The question becomes, what effect this change has on day-of-the-week return patterns for the Dow Jones Industrial Average, Standard and Poor's 500 index, and Standard and Poor's 500 index futures. I find Monday's return pattern has changed in the decade of the 1990's. Not only is Monday's mean return significantly large and positive for all indices, the entire anomalous pattern occurs from Monday's open to Monday's close - an intraday effect. In addition, I find evidence that trading volume is a factor in explaining the anomalous behaviour of Monday's returns. New York Stock Exchange trading volume is significantly lower on Mondays from the trading volume of other days of the week but the trading activity of individual investors is significantly higher. More recently, individual investors have increased their buying activity on Mondays relative to prior periods. Finally, Monday exhibits the largest returns in the first two trading hours when the Dow Jones Industrial Average returns are decomposed into hourly returns.

The proposed model is based on the integrated framework of Fishbein and Ajzen's Theory of Reasoned Action (TRA), Triadis's Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB) and Rettie's 2002 Basic E-mail Response Process Model. For data collection, qualitative and quantitative studies were used. The qualitative results from four semi-structured interviews reveal New Zealand enterprises' strong trust in permission-based e-mail marketing and how they implement it as one of their marketing strategies. The quantitative component presents and empirically tests the proposed model in terms of a personalisation (presence/absence), interactivity (low/high) and vividness (low/medium/high) (2*2*3) between-subjects factorial design, where subjects were exposed to an e-mail advertisement for a mobile phone. From 650 responses collected by clicking on an e-mail link through an online web survey, the data was analysed with analysis of covariance (ANCOVA). Based on strong suggestions in the literature and findings in the qualitative study on the importance of permission-based marketing, attitude toward permission e-mail was examined as one of the dependent variables in the quantitative study. Results reveal similarities and differences in the effects of interactivity, vividness and personalisation respectively between the low and high attitude toward permission based e-mail marketing groups. Although significant effects of interactivity on attitude and behavioural intention were observed, the nature of those effects proved contrary to the author's expectation. In terms of vividness, results showed significant effects on attitude and behavioural intention in both groups as anticipated. Conversely, personalisation was shown to have no effect on attitude and behavioural intention in any group, however, a positive effect on response rates was indicated. Two three-way interaction effects between interactivity, vividness and personalisation on attitude toward brand and friend recommendation were found only in the high group. This study strongly encourages e-mail marketers to respect their customers' privacy and to employ a permission-based marketing concept within their business strategy. The design of the e-mail (moderate to high vividness) and personalisation (use of recipient's name) are indicated to have a positive impact on the effectiveness of an e-mail ad. Future research should examine a permission-based marketing construct as a longitudinal study, and investigate personalisation at a higher level (based on recipients' preferences).",,,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/857",,,"en",,,"University of Canterbury.

Hungary as one of the new EU Member States which might foster directly or indirectly

Although Amat et al.

However, there has been no further study to extend Amat et al.'s (1994) findings.  This thesis resembles Amat et al.'s (1994) study, analysing the progressive formalisation of MAS in a Chinese company: Shanghai Light Industry Machinery Stock Company Limited, during periods of change at both the social and organisational levels.    It was found that three outer, social factors (socio-economic condition, competition and socio-culture) and three inner, organisational ones (autonomy, profitability and authority) have greatly impacted on the progressive formalisation of the MAS in the Chinese company during the period studied.

"1180","10092/839",,,"Roy, Achinto Mohan",,,,,"2006",,"Corruption in business occurs in situations of a quid pro quo relationship between public officials and business managers representing corporations. Many a time, such corrupt situations can harm stakeholder interests. Managers, as decision-makers, in corruption-related situations may fail to understand the impact of their decisions in such situation for they operate from a position of ""position-dependent objectivity"" (Sen, 2002) focusing on economic objectives usually. They may fail to understand that their involvement in corrupt acts can lead to violation of fundamental stakeholder issues such as human rights as in the cases of Shell and Enron (discussed in this thesis). The thesis examines the meaning of corruption in relation to its stakeholder impact and proposes that corporate good governance in corruption-related situations is a matter of ethical decision-making, exceeding legal compliance. It explores the decision-making factors that operate within an individual manager while dealing with corruption-related situations in business and maps an analytical mental model of a decision-making manager in such situations. The thesis proposes 'Corruption-related Decision-making' (CRDM) as an orderly way of thinking for managers to deal with corruption-related situations in business. The CRDM concept is demonstrated through the use of a new Corruption-related Decision-making model that protects human rights, environmental issues, sustainable development and any other relevant stakeholder issue that one may wish to include. The relevance of the CRDM concept and the model was evaluated in a survey of forty-one multinational companies from Mumbai, India. The survey confirmed that none of the respondents used any decision-making tools while dealing with corruption-related situations. The survey revealed that 40 out of 41 companies experienced rent-seeking behaviour (bribes demanded) in India. Out of these 41 companies, 26 companies 'usually' lost business due to non-compliance with bribe demands and another 9 companies lost business 'sometimes.' The survey also explored the role of 'fear of loss of business' in the decision-making process and found that 'fear of loss of business' led decision-makers change stance from a state of passive corruption (facing demand) to a position of active corruption (making an offer), with 27 companies actually moving from a position of passive corruption to active corruption. All 41 companies, without a single exception, believed (when asked) that corruption can adversely affect stakeholder issues such as human rights. The survey findings confirm the relevance of the CRDM model as a decision-making tool and as a good practice document in corruption-related situations. The CRDM model can motivate an internal review of a manager's persona with a reminder that ethical decision-making and protection of stakeholder rights is possible in corruption-related situations. The concept of CRDM is a potential contribution in dealing with the illegitimate, the illegal and the oppressive aspects of international business.",,,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/858",,,"en",,,"University of Canterbury.

A qualitative investigation into services for the education of learners with vision impairment identified the common aim of giving students equal access to the curriculum as their sighted peers. It also elicited potential determinants of need that affect caseload allocation decisions.    Opportunity-to-learn was identified as a concept in the research literature, which has evolved from a measure of content coverage into a potential indicator of school effectiveness, measured almost exclusively from the teachers' perception. This research drew on the growing body of research that asks the students, to shift the focus from the teacher to the students themselves.    An instrument was developed, based on the Essential Skills of the New Zealand curriculum, that measures opportunity-to-learn from the perspective of the students. This was used to collect baseline data on 1300 students, with no identified special needs, from twenty secondary schools throughout New Zealand. Analysis of the baseline data demonstrated the validity of the approach, and its potential to aid in research on the educational process, using this set of intermediate indicators. Results showed differences between schools and between girls and boys. The mean index scores for the schools were not strongly related to the socio-economic background of the schools, but did reflect independent measures of school quality.    The instrument was then used to measure opportunity-to-learn for fifty learners with vision impairment in regular high schools. Comprehensive data on these learners was gathered from regular and specialist teachers, parents, schools and the individuals themselves. This data was analysed to evaluate the services and the opportunity-to-learn for the learners with vision impairment. Results showed that on average these students had opportunity-to-learn at least as good as for their sighted peers. Areas of weakness and strength within the service were identified.

More recently, a number of hybrid models have been developed, combining the merits of both methods. In this vein, we present an econometric model for daily spot prices in the New Zealand Electricity Market (NZEM) that utilises reservoir management theory to incorporate information on the hydro storage level, a recognised driver of NZEM spot price behaviour. In order to forecast future storage levels and prices, we also construct a model for daily reservoir releases that can be used in conjunction with time series of inflows. This analysis reveals that releases in New Zealand are driven primarily by hydrological factors, as opposed to market conditions. The combined price and storage forecasting model can be applied in a variety of contexts, and offers an alternative perspective to the traditional models of NZEM behaviour. Finally, we calibrate a Cournot model of market behaviour in the National Electricity Market of Australia during daily peak, shoulder and off-peak periods, adding credibility to the future application of such models. The resulting model parameters are, in general, consistent with conventional wisdom.

"1187","10092/839",,,"Shanahan, Yvonne Petronella",,,,,"2002",,"This research undertakes a contingency theory examination of strategy and cost system alignment based on customer retention and customer profitability analysis. Previous research and consultancy advice has promoted the benefits of a firm following a customer retention strategy. They claim that in order to support the strategy a firm should have a customer profitability analysis system in place. Yet often what is prescribed as good practice is not observed in firms. This inconsistency is explained using contingency theory.  Initial qualitative evidence was collected from four industry sites to determine whether the above strategy-cost system alignment was present. An analysis of these findings suggested that the customer retention-customer profitability analysis system relationship was contingent on a range of factors. As a result, a contingent theory of this relationship was developed from the four sites, and this theory was then tested in a survey of 862 people from 431 firms.  The survey results provide support for the propositions developed from the qualitative evidence. It is likely that firms will follow multiple operational marketing strategies and have cost management systems in place to support those strategies. Although customer retention is a very important operational marketing strategy, a significant number of firms do not have customer profitability analysis systems in place to support the strategy. Many contingent factors were identified. Customer profitability analysis implementation is dependent on industry type;  size; the difficulties involved in determining customer costs; whether the organisation has a champion for the system; the relationship between the marketing and accounting functions in a firm; and the available labour resources to facilitate implementation.  Further, it is apparent that customer profitability analysis information is not essential to support a customer retention strategy. Customer revenue information can be substituted and the firms are satisfied with the level of management accounting system support for their operational marketing strategies.  However, many respondents see the value of customer revenue, customer cost and customer profitability information, providing opportunities for future design of such systems as well as research into their development.",,,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/865",,,"en",,,"University of Canterbury.

The protracted promulgation of this accounting standard over eight years is the research event of interest.  New Zealand's overhauled Public Finance Act 1989 introduced a requirement for the Crown to produce accrual consolidated accounts prepared in accordance with GAAP. Consolidation GAAP was vague however and a preferential modified equity accounting method was used throughout the development period of FRS-37. This seemed contradictory to the sector-neutral GAAP stance since the method was not allowed in the private sector. After FRS-37 was approved the Crown was required to present financial reports incorporating its interests in State Owned Enterprises and Crown entities on a fully consolidated basis. Subsequently international developments in government accounting put the viability of so-called NZ GAAP into question. The research objective was to better understand what happened.  The historical method of Porter (1981) is used to trace the changes shaping the event. This involved consideration of antecedent and subsequent conditions around the event as well as its internal development. The event of FRS-37 commenced in September 1993 following the establishment of the Accounting Standards Review Board by the Financial Reporting Act 1993 which necessitated the development of a sector-neutral consolidation standard for approval, and concluded around October 2001 when FRS-37 was approved. The comparative antecedent period commencing around 1985 indicated the contextual conditions leading into the event, and the subsequent period to 2006 following FRS-37's implementation showed changed conditions that confirmed the event's conclusion.  The contribution of this thesis is that it documents the defined event and explains what happened, offering understanding of the issues around consolidation accounting, sector-neutral GAAP and public sector financial management.",,,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/868",,,"en",,,"University of Canterbury.

Findings emerged on several levels.    The market orientation and marketing concept, beyond the level of customer focus, is not well understood in organisations.  The integration of market orientation and marketing effort across the organisation presents as the most problematic component of the marketing concept, as well as the one where CEO leadership style has the most potential to impact.    The language of leadership theory is not actively assumed by people working in the case study organisations.  The way people experience leadership style is ultimately personal, interpersonal and difficult to describe.  Leadership attributes are valued differently in different organisations.  Highly regarded leadership strengths result in perceived weaknesses being forgiven.    In relation to the main research question, intuitively most people believed there is a connection between CEO leadership style and adoption of the marketing concept, but this was difficult to test at an organisational level due to small sample sizes and because each case study business presented with relatively high market orientations and CEOs with appropriate leadership styles.  The CEO leadership themes commonly determined to be relevant were people focus (in terms of customers and staff), vision, change orientation, and passion/enthusiasm for the business.      Survey data at the individual level was aggregated across the five organisations and analysed.  Results showed the above attributes, and others associated with transformational leadership approaches, were related to perceptions of market orientation.  While these results cannot be statistically generalisable because of the small and unrepresentative sample used, the findings suggest that the link between individual organisation members' perceptions of market orientation and CEO leadership would be worthy of a larger study.",,,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/869",,,"en",,,"University of Canterbury.

This problem is of great economic significance to New Zealand, whose economy depends to a large extent on the fishery industry. To assist the fishery manager, we develop a mixed integer linear program (MILP) for optimal scheduling of fishing trawlers, production planning (processing) and labour allocation for a quota-based integrated fishery of New Zealand. The model decides when and where each trawler should go for fishing, how much fish each trawler should land, and how much product to produce in each period. Since the fishery is a private farm, its main objective will be profit maximization (or cost minimization if its demand is on contract). The government manages the conservation of fish through the quota allocation. In this thesis the objective of the fishery model is to maximise the total profit. We demonstrate our model with examples based on data from a major New Zealand fishery.  We investigate ways to manage the uncertainties involved in trawler scheduling and production planning of the fishery. To manage end-of-planning-horizon effects in the fishery, we develop a simple safety stock approach. We also analyse the workability of a rolling horizon approach to solve the longer planning horizon models and to deal with the end-of-planning horizon effects.  We investigate the effect of initial and final position of the trawlers on the profit. We also investigated many different challenging data sets to observe the impact on the effectiveness of our IFPM.   The second objective of this thesis is to develop an efficient solution procedure for the MILP, named integrated fishery planning model (IFPM).  The IFPM consists of a fishing subproblem, a processing subproblem, and complicating side constraints. We have tried techniques including LP relaxation, Lagrangean relaxation (LR), Dantzig-Wolfe decomposition (DWD) and decomposition-based pricing (DBP). We develop a new DBP method to solve the IFPM. It gives excellent computation times. We also develop a decomposition-based O'Neill pricing (DBONP) method to improve the solution obtained from DBP procedure. It improves the DBP solutions but takes longer time to solve the IFPM. Finally, we develop a simple and efficient reduced cost-based pricing (RCBP) method. It takes less time to solve the IFPM and yields excellent results.  The initial formulations for several planning horizons are solved using the AMPL modelling language and CPLEX with branch and bound. Relevant results and computational difficulties are reported.",,,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/873",,,"en",,,"University of Canterbury.

An emic/ insider research approach was used as the author was an employee of one of the merging organisations. Primary data was collected through personal observations and unstructured and semi-structured interviews with thirty merger participants consisting of, general and academic staff, management, and one student. Secondary data sources included existing merger literature, organisational communication and change policies, and press articles.  The study focused on four aspects of social dynamics: i) use of language, ii) expression of emotions, iii) meaning making, and iv) exit behaviour. The use of language depicted the merger as a battle that felt like a war-zone, while humour was used as a prop and revealed sub-text of negative emotions. Expression of emotions portrayed the intensity of feeling, acted as a lens to process meaning, and heightened the organisational atmosphere. Recipients of the merger such as, staff attributed different meanings to the change than those in charge of the merger did such as, management, which impacted relationships, self-confidence, career direction, and provoked self-assessment. Overall, staff felt excluded from the merger process and as a result exercised a range of exit behaviours including escapism, withholding of effort, disengagement, and defiance.   This study suggests that minimising dysfunctional exit behaviour can be achieved through inclusive communication processes, transparent decision-making, and acknowledgement and management of emotions. An inclusive merger structure should provide mechanisms for staff to express emotions as well as integrate roles that enable what is important to staff to be built into the process. Additionally, as mergers are likely to be contested processes, management skill is required to defuse stress and tension, and to resolve conflicts.",,,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/876",,,"en",,,"University of Canterbury.

Environmental responsibility as a part of CSR is often connected with sustainability and protection the environment. This is of a significant importance to New Zealand and its 'clean' and 'green' image. One industry having an impact on the environment, and also having a strategic position in the economy of New Zealand is the wine industry. The aim of the research is to understand what motivates and sustains companies' CSR practices. This exploratory study examines (1) what drives the industry to engage in CSR practices, (2) the role of stakeholders in the company's decision making, and (3) CSR practices in the wine industry. A qualitative research approach supplemented by quantitative measures was adopted to answer the research questions. 24 case study organizations (wineries) were studied and 31 managers interviewed. The research found that the most important drivers of CSR practices are personal values, preferences and satisfaction with this profession. This is followed by product quality and customers' demand. Though New Zealand wine companies are also driven by the market; the market still does not value CSR initiatives and companies do not receive a price premium for sustainable or organically grown grapes. Furthermore, environmental regulations belong to important drivers affecting companies' decision-making. However, companies do not consider current New Zealand's regulations as significantly difficult to follow. On the other hand, companies want to preempt future regulations. The research also revealed that the most important stakeholders are owners, shareholders, customers, wholesalers and international businesses. The role of communication and ecolabelling is also discussed. As a result, the study proposes a typology matrix that differentiates organizations' involvement in CSR according to the extent of CSR practices and their drivers. This study contributes to understanding of the New Zealand wine industry status in environmental CSR at the present, the extent of drivers of proactive environmentalism and companies' stakeholders, and the description of a typology matrix of companies engaging in CSR.

"1184","10092/839",,,"Newberry, Susan Margaret",,,,,"2002",,"New Zealand's public sector reforms have been hailed as a model of theoretical consistency and coherence. The associated financial management reforms, known internationally as new public financial management (NPFM), were world-leading although they are no longer unique. The underlying nature and intent of public sector reforms have been the subject of considerable debate internationally. Early public sector reforms openly sought privatisation, often on ideological grounds. However, in the face of gathering public opposition, public discussion of privatisation softened. NPM and NPFM have been promoted instead    mainly on more pragmatic grounds such as improving public sector performance.   In New Zealand, the Public Finance Act 1989 is the key legislation underpinning the financial management reforms. The Act delegates regulatory powers to the Treasury and, over time, a considerable body of secondary regulation, including accounting rules, has been developed. However, this secondary regulation, and its contribution to the success or otherwise of the public sector reforms, has not been examined in detail to date.   In 1999, New Zealand s Controller and Auditor-General suggested that the financial management system erodes government departments  resources and that somehow this resource erosion escapes parliamentary scrutiny. The Treasury, on the other hand, defended the foundations of the financial management system as solid, arguing that retention of the existing framework would allow further and faster progress towards improved performance and value-for-money than would be achieved by a new set of reforms. This debate prompts questions whether and, if so, how and why a financial management system, ostensibly implemented to improve the performance and accountability of the public sector, could be linked to such effects, and whether parliamentary scrutiny is indeed avoided. This thesis examines the secondary regulation and explains the development of the financial management system with the intention of answering those questions.   The analysis undertaken in this thesis suggests that New Zealand's public sector financial management system fabricates the conditions under which privatisation initiatives might be accepted for pragmatic reasons. The erosion of departments  financial resources is an essential mechanism in that fabrication process. As this system has developed, the time available for parliamentary scrutiny has reduced and the Controller and Auditor-General s controller function has been eroded, while the control and discretion exercised within the Treasury has increased. Arguably, these developments have helped to conceal the system s privatising intent. The thesis identifies features of the financial management system used to rationalise the financial resource-eroding processes. It also notes that if New Zealand's financial management system is no longer unique, then other NPFM systems may contain a similar combination of features.",,,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/862",,,"en",,,"University of Canterbury.

"4796","10092/839",,,"Albertson, K. V.",,,,,"1993",,"This thesis considers some finite sample properties of a number of preliminary test (pre-test) estimators of the unknown parameters of a linear regression model that may have been mis-specified as a result of incorrectly assuming that the disturbance term has a scalar covariance matrix, and/or as a result of the exclusion of relevant regressors. The pre-test itself is a test for exact linear restrictions and is conducted using the usual Wald statistic, which provides a Uniformly Most Powerful Invariant test of the restrictions in a well specified model. The parameters to be estimated are the coefficient vector, the prediction vector (i.e. the expectation of the dependent variable conditional on the regressors), and the regression scale parameter. Note that while the problem of estimating the prediction vector is merely a special case of estimating the coefficient vector when the model is well specified, this is not the case when the model is mis-specified.
 
 The properties of each of these estimators in a well specified regression model have been examined in the literature, as have the effects of a number of different model mis-specifications, and we survey these results in Chapter Two. We will extend the existing literature by generalising the error covariance matrix in conjunction with allowing for possibly excluded regressors. To motivate the consideration of a nonscalar error covariance matrix in the context of a pre-test situation we briefly examine the literature on autoregressive and heteroscedastic error processes in Chapter Three.
 
 In Chapters Four, Five, Six, and Seven we derive the cumulative distribution function of the test statistic, and exact formulae for the bias and risk (under quadratic loss) of the unrestricted, restricted and pre-test estimators, in a model with a general error covariance matrix and possibly excluded relevant regressors. These formulae are data dependent and, to illustrate the results, are evaluated for a number of regression models and forms of error covariance matrix. In particular we determine the effects of autoregressive errors and heteroscedastic errors on each of the regression models under consideration.
 
 Our evaluations confirm the known result that the presence of a non scalar error covariance matrix introduces a distortion into the pre-test power function and we show the effects of this on the pre-test estimators. In addition to this we show that one effect of the mis-specification may be that the pre-test and restricted estimators may be strictly dominated by the corresponding unrestricted estimator even if there are no relevant regressors excluded from the model. If there are relevant regressors excluded from the model it appears that the additional mis-specification of the error covariance matrix has little qualitative impact unless the coefficients on the excluded regressors are small in magnitude or the excluded regressors are not correlated with the included regressors.
 
 As one of the effects of the mis-specification is to introduce a distortion into the pre-test power function, in Chapter Eight we consider the problem of determining the optimal critical value (under the criterion of minimax regret) for the pre-test when estimating the regression coefficient vector. We show that the mis-specification of the error covariance matrix may have a substantial impact on the optimal critical value chosen for the pre-test under this criterion, although, generally, the actual size of the pre-test is relatively unaffected by increasing degrees of mis-specification.
 
 Chapter Nine concludes this thesis and provides a summary of the results obtained in the earlier chapters.

world and academic literature. The New Zealand public sector has, according to some
commentators, been at the forefront of international developments since the 1980s. Yet
discussion and analysis of current New Zealand public sector accounting is generally
devoid of reference to its historical antecedent. This thesis addresses part of the lack of
historical understanding of public sector accounting, auditing and financial management
by providing an historical discussion of accounting and auditing by New Zealand
municipalities between 1876 and 1988.
Local government has always been central to the development of New Zealand's
infrastructure and economy - efficiency and equity being crucial attributes of the sector.
Essential to achieving efficiency and equity have been key financial and accounting
principles. This thesis identifies and discusses the operation of these principles. While the
principles informed most decisions relating to local government, they were not sacrosanct.
Discussed in this thesis are instances where the principles were cast aside by legislation
for particular situations, either for all municipalities or for a specific council.
The accounting and financial management requirements were to ensure that councils were
held to account for the use of ratepayers' money. This thesis identifies and discusses
changes regarding whom the borough or city councils were accountable to. In the early
period, accounts were clearly prepared for the local community. From the 1880s to the
early 1970s, council gave account to the Audit Office, which received the account on
behalf of a local community. In the early 1970s, lead by the Audit Office, this attitude
changed back to the community, which held its council to account. This thesis traces the
technical and philosophical changes to the accounting, auditing and financial management
requirements imposed on municipalities by Parliament and central government. It also
discusses the relationships between the parties involved in choosing between different
levels of central oversight and local autonomy, and in choosing between different
accounting policies.",,,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/2711",,,"en",,,"University of Canterbury.

achieve integrated management of natural and physical resources in their regions. They must prepare
a regional policy statement and a coastal policy statement, and where necessary regional plans. In
addition, they have certain other duties under the RMA: to consider alternatives, benefits, and costs
(section 32); and to gather information, monitor, and keep records (section 35). However, the RMA
does not clearly outline how regional councils should provide information to the public about
progress made towards objectives as outlined in regional plans and policy statements and their other
duties. It is important for the regional council to be accountable to the public for their progress made
towards objectives and their duties since, as ratepayers, the public are financial contributors.1
This study investigates how regional councils are currently providing information to the public about
progress made towards objectives and their other duties as required under the RMA. This study also
investigates whether the annual plans and annual reports (as required under the Local Government
Act 1974 (LGA)) are the appropriate vehicles for disclosing this information. The research is
conducted through a survey sent to accountants who coordinate and/or prepare annual plans and
annual reports in regional councils (or councils with regional responsibilities) who prepare annual
plans and annual reports. Follow-up interviews were held with two accountants at these regional
councils. The research has found that the RMA has currently had little impact on the provision of
information by regional councils in annual plans and annual reports. However, the impact may be
greater in the future.",,,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/2709",,,"en",,,"University of Canterbury.

literature compared to the valuation of listed companies. This is despite the fact that the
bulk of companies are unlisted (99.9%). This thesis provides the first significant
empirical research into the valuation of unlisted companies in New Zealand. The
modern finance technique of discounted cash flow (DCF) analysis is posited as being
the best way to value unlisted companies as going concerns. It is found that valuation
practice in the New Zealand Courts has generally not followed modern finance theory. ,
DCF analysis has received scant usage. Additionally, North American research that has
investigated the relevant information (factors) for valuing unlisted companies has been
largely ignored in New Zealand.
This thesis investigated Court data over a 19 year time span from 1976 until
1995. All types of cases involving the valuation of unlisted companies were considered.
Information was initially analysed by a computer database, followed by a more in-depth
study. The primary findings are that notional liquidation and capitalised maintainable
earmngs are the main valuation methods utilised in the New Zealand Courts.
Compromise decisions are often reached by judges (66.7% of the time), but the
important valuation factors are rarely enunciated.
Recommendations are made to the Institute of Chartered Accountants of New
Zealand (ICANZ). The methods currently being utilised to value unlisted companies in
New Zealand are antiquated and need to be modernised. Therefore, the ICANZ should
raise standards and stimulate debate in the field. Continuing education courses need to
educate valuers on recent developments in modern finance theory, in particular, DCF
analysis. This will benefit the Courts as it will give them more transparent and reliable
information. Additionally, guidelines on valuation factors would be of value. A
number of areas for further research are suggested.",,,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/2708",,,"en",,,"University of Canterbury.

analysis and its use in a relationship marketing strategy (Carrol, 1992-1993; Johnson,
1992; Storbacka, 1993). Yet, to date, this has largely been unsubstantiated by
academic research. A case study was conducted at a bank to describe a relationship
marketing strategy and a customer profitability analysis (CPA) system and to discover
how the customer profitability information provided by the CPA system is used to
support the relationship marketing strategy.
The Bank follows a relationship marketing strategy as described by Christopher et al
(1991). It was found that the bank currently has a first generation CPA system
(Bellis-Jones, 1989). Recognising the limitations of such an analysis, the bank is in
the process of designing and implementing a new CPA system, which clearly exhibits
the characteristics of second generation CPA (Foster & Gupta, 1994). It was found
that customer revenue is easily definable, yet customer costs and customer risk pose a
significant issue when included in a CPA system. A number of cost and risk areas are
still unresolved, as are some issues regarding the use of the customer profitability
information.
The Bank does not use customer profitability as the basis of its customer segmentation
due to the inadequacy of the current CPA system to accurately determine customer
profitability. Instead, income is used as a substitute for profitability and it is income
that forms the basis of the bank's customer segmentation. It was also found that the
Bank intends to merge CPA information with customer relationship information, once
the new customer profitability system is implemented.
Despite limitations, this thesis extends the body of knowledge concerning
management accounting information and relationship marketing, by providing a
valuable insight into these areas in a New Zealand context.",,,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/2707",,,"en",,,"University of Canterbury.

particular firm's situation, the likelihood of business failure can also be influenced by
the economic conditions of the nation in which the business operates. Within the New

registered companies, and overlooked the importance of unincorporated entities.
Therefore, the objective of this thesis is to re-examine the relationship between business
failure, including both incorporated and unincorporated entities, and the aggregate
economy. Accordingly, two research questions are developed: what are the
incorporated and unincorporated business failure rates, and what macroeconomic
variables explain the changes in the level of business failure. This study estimates the
failure of unincorporated businesses by using bankruptcy statistics of ""employers of
labour"" and ""working on own account but not employing labour."" This study
concentrates on three kinds of business failure during the period of 1947 to 1998, courtordered
company liquidations, company receiverships, and unincorporated
bankruptcies; correspondingly, three lagged multiple regression models are developed.
This study found that there is a relationship between business failure and the nation's
economic conditions, especially the country's monetary conditions, economic activity,
and new business formation. It was also found that economic activity has the greatest

developments of the mid 1980s in the United States. In New Zealand the level of
attention has been appreciably lower.
This study critically reviews the effective tax rate literature from the United States,
Canada, United Kingdom and Australasia, with the objective to isolate the essential
findings of the research and to develop issues for consideration in New Zealand. A
conceptual framework is developed for the measurement of average effective tax rates
(AETRs) in New Zealand, incorporating an empirical and triangulation approach.
The focus is to measure the AETR for listed public companies from 1984 to 1991,
utilising three AETR ratios. The resulting AETRs are examined by way of individual
companies, industry and sharemarket capitalisation groupings, with critical findings
presented in both graphical and tabular form. Non-parametric statistics were utilised to
test the research hypotheses, including sample representativeness and the significance of
the ratio measure adopted.
The results suggest that through incorporating a multiple period and triangulation research
approach, AETRs, on average over time, are not dependent upon the particular research
measure employed. However, the results for the industry and capitalisation manipulations
of the data were mixed.
The conceptual framework also includes the results of a mail questionnaire survey of
expected AETR users and advisers. Parametric testing of the responses was employed to
test the research hypotheses, as well as to identify the presence of any non-response bias.
The testing provided mixed results, with evidence of response bias present in the results.
Selected policy issues are discussed, with suggested reforms for the current ETR
measurement and disclosure requirements offered for interested parties in New Zealand.

departments' operating expenditure, thus, reporting on these resources is important.
Yet, to date, a practical alternative to the monetary valuation and reporting of human
resources has still to be found.
This thesis examines the usefulness and practicality of reporting non-monetary human
resource information in government departments' statements of service performance.
The examination was conducted through a mail questionnaire sent to all 39 government
departments, with a response rate of 87% (34 questionnaires out of 39 sent) being
achieved. Personal interviews were then conducted with two of the respondents.
The majority (84%) of government department financial controllers believed it was
necessary to report non-monetary human resource information. A statement of service
performance (SSP) received 61% support as the method of disclosure, followed by a
statement of resources (48%), a separate human resource report (45%), and a chief
executive's report (42%). There was considerable support for the disclosure in the SSP
of several items of human resource information as either inputs, outputs or outcomes.
A number of costs and benefits were also identified by respondents as resulting from
the disclosure of human resource information in the SSP. However, when comparing
the overall costs and benefits, the majority of respondents did not expect such reporting
to be cost effective. These results indicate that, although there is support in theory for
reporting non-monetary human resource information in government departments' SSPs,
further research is necessary to determine the practicality of such reporting.
The results of this thesis have extended the literature concerning disclosure of human
resource information. Many costs and benefits associated with the provision of
monetary human resource information have been found to apply to the reporting of
non-monetary human resource information. Furthermore, many of the non-monetary
human resource measures suggested for the private sector were found to be applicable

the implementation of information systems (IS). Despite general acceptance of the
benefit of aligning IS strategy with organisation strategy to obtain the maximum benefit,
few attempts have been made to define and quantify this relationship. Before it is
possible to quantify the effect of alignment on performance it is first necessary to be able
to measure alignment itself. In particular, the past models have largely neglected the
specific considerations of smaller business organisations. This thesis assesses the past
research into business strategy, information systems strategy and alignment. It is
determined which of the prior models is most appropriate as the basis for provision of a
measure of strategic alignment in small firms with the aim of providing a solid base for
further research in actually quantifying the effect of strategic alignment on performance.
The model selected from the assessment of past research involved a series of four
instruments assessing business strategy, IS strategy, IS effectiveness and business
performance. Churchill's (1979) recommended steps for the development and
subsequent testing of construct measures were followed in adapting the chosen model
and instruments to be used in small firms. The resulting instruments were tested via
multiple cases, using firms from four different industries in order to provide a wider
opportunity for interviewer assessment of the performance of the instruments. The
quantitative results were consistently found to parallel the interviewers' qualitative
assessments of the information systems alignment in each firm. Additionally, the
instruments met the requirements for validity and reliability that were able to be tested
with a case study approach. Overall therefore, the results of this thesis provide a
significant step towards providing a method for the measurement of strategic alignment

research into methods for determining the impact of strategic alignment on the

performed a laboratory experiment consisting of four decision problems relating to
tax situations and two decision problems relating to other financial contexts. The focus of
interest was the power of each tax context's stated prepayment position to induce a decision
frame (as predicted by Prospect Theory) capable of determining each participant's risk
preferences. The use of a repeated measures analysis of variance procedure (general linear
model) allowed for within-subject comparisons so that decision-frame-induced shifts in
individual participants' risk preferences across decision problems could be diagnosed. The
study found, with respect to the tax problems, that the predictions of Prospect Theory and the
findings of Dusenbury (1994) were generally supported. However, similar risk preference
shifts based on alternative decision frames, independent of prepayment position and all other
contextual information, were also detected.
When within-subject comparisons were also generated by contrasting of tax and non-tax
decision problems, identical apart from context, it was found that participants produced
evidence of dissimilar, context-sensitive risk preferences. Risk preferences were also found to
be stable for decision problems containing identical option sets and similar, but not identical
contexts. Also, a significant behavioural difference was detected between participants with
high cash floats and those with low cash floats; but this was not differentiated from an
awareness of cash float status variable in the study. Finally, while the underlying value
functions of the participants conformed to the predictions of Prospect Theory in the tax
contexts, there were some departures from the predicted form when the decision problem was

Existing studies have underlined the significance of perceived authenticity and related attributes in influencing customer satisfaction in an ethnic restaurant scenario. The academic literature offers relatively low insight into the managerial perceptions of authenticity and related attributes in ethnic restaurants. Besides, a limited number of studies have analyzed Indian cuisine in a hospitality backdrop. No specific research on Indian restaurants has been previously carried out in New Zealand, given the prevalence of the long history of Indian community in the country. On the other hand, research on ethnic restaurants has been quite one dimensional as it tends to only cover the consumers‟ perceptions of the restaurant attributes in order to deliver appropriate marketing strategies to the restaurant management. The ethnic restaurant perceptions of authenticity have been seldom explored. This study tries to fill the identified gap by garnering Indian restaurants‟ perception of authenticity in terms of the Indian cuisine, along with the significance of restaurant attributes and menu in exhibiting the authentic traits of the Indian restaurants. 

The existing literature provides three approaches to define the concept of authenticity: objectivist, constructivist and post-modern approaches. Perceived authenticity is observed to be a significant factor that is linked with ethnic restaurants and related servicescape attributes. Besides, the concept of authenticity is studied to be vital factor in influencing customer satisfaction in ethnic restaurants. The concept of ethnicity and role of ethnic restaurants is explored to derive the significance of ethnic foods in representing a particular culture in immigrant countries. The present literature also provides various models of servicescape framework that depict the prevalence of individual servicescape elements in influencing customer satisfaction in a service environment.

This research project was carried out on Indian restaurants in Christchurch, the third largest city in New Zealand. A mixed method approach was utilized in order to attain the objectives of this study. The restaurant menu and servicescape elements of ten Indian restaurants were studied. The restaurants were selected based on their ratings on Zomato. Menu analysis was carried out to identify elements of the Indian restaurant menu that exhibit authentic traits and to determine the frequency of the dishes. Additionally, servicescape analysis was performed to identify the distinctive and similar elements in the Indian restaurant scenario using the servicescape framework identified in the literature. Besides, semi-structured interviews of the Indian restaurant managers were carried out to understand their perceptions of authenticity, menu design and servicescape attributes. This component was also performed to supplement the findings of the menu and servicescape analysis. Observation and content analysis was deployed to interpret the data collected to achieve the results of this research project. 

The findings of this study are segregated into three sections respectively based on the research component. Menu and servicescape analysis reveal the distinctive elements included in the Indian restaurant menu and servicescape that possess the ability to influence customer satisfaction. The analysis of semi-structured interviews further reveals managerial views regarding the main elements of Indian cuisine, how local customers perceive authenticity of Indian food, elements involved in menu selection and design along with the role of distinctive servicescape elements in influencing customer satisfaction. This runs parallel with the existing literature and results derived in the menu and servicescape analysis.

The current study acts as a pathway to carry out further research in the Indian restaurant scenario in New Zealand from both managerial and customers‟ perspectives. Since New Zealand thrives on multiculturism, it is recommended to carry out similar studies across ethnic restaurants representing different cultures. The limitations of this study are duly acknowledged. Besides, the potential contribution of this study is noted down to derive managerial implications and further amplify the existing literature.",,,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/14425",,,"en","English",,"University of Canterbury",,,,,"http://library.canterbury.ac.nz/thesis/etheses_copyright.shtml",,"All Rights Reserved",,,,,,,,,,,"Indian foodways in Christchurch - a study of Indian restaurants",,,"Electronic Thesis or Dissertation",,,"Business Administration",,"University of Canterbury",,"Masters",,,"Master of Commerce",,,"2532372",,"College of Business and Law, University of Canterbury",,,"Ameya.Parodkar@pg.canterbury.nz",,,,,,,,"Professor C Michael Hall"

scope of the resources and resource attributes which are recognized by accounting
is being broadened-from a preoccupation with the financial characteristics of
economic resources to also embracing non-financial characteristics and noneconomic
resources. Secondly, some of the traditional ""branches"" of accounting
are becoming less divisive-concepts, techniques and rules are crossing the
boundaries and the practice of focusing attention on one branch to the exclusion of
the others is yielding to more holistic approaches.
The main concern of this thesis is non-financial recording and reporting and the
role it can play. It argues that service performance reporting, as proposed and
implemented in New Zealand, is conceptually incomplete and requires research to
discover how it might become an adequate accounting tool. The strength of the
accounting world-view lies in the way it represents the duality and reciprocality of
giving and receiving. Building a non-economic reporting regime involves
identifying the non-economic motivations underlying giving and receiving. Since
the activities of enterprises are many and varied, different classes of enterprise are
likely to be motivated by different mixes of objectives. Arts enterprises are one
class of enterprises, chosen in this thesis for closer investigation.
The role of accounting in arts enterprises and their funding intermediaries has
traditionally been equivocal. Accounting has assisted in obtaining funds and in
planning and control, but it has also been a tool for submerging non-economic in
favour of economic objectives. Service performance reporting could modify these
roles by giving non-economic objectives an equal billing with economic
objectives, legitimizing the non-economic and altering the balance of power in
favour of those with social and economic policy objectives or with personal
aesthetic objectives. The identification of objectives and performance measures is,

"3141","10092/839","Ma, Hengyun",,,,,,,"2009",,"The ongoing transition of former communist countries from planned to market economies has been one of the most important economic phenomena in the last few decades. Among these, China is one of the largest and fastest growing emerging economies in the world since the reforms initiated in the late 1980s. China’s economic growth has been phenomenal. 
       Therefore, understanding China’s energy economy is crucial in the new millennium for politicians, businessmen and energy economists. In particular, China’s energy policy directions will bring about both challenges and opportunities to the world in terms of an increasing share of primary energy consumption and investment in the energy industry. However, after surveying the literature, it is surprising to find that a few major areas of China’s energy economics are missing and the views on China’s energy economics are already out dated. Therefore, given the size and growth of its economy and the effect of its energy consumption on global energy markets, reviewing China’s energy situation and filling the missing literatures are essential for those who are interested in and concerned about China’s economic development in the new millennium. 
       This study was motivated after conducting a survey of the literature on the study of China’s energy economy and reviewing China’s energy situation in the new millennium. The goal of the research is focused on providing readers the most important and the newest information on China’s energy economy. The study consists of three introductory sections and three core sections. The former includes a survey of literature, China’s energy situation in the new millennium, institutional evolution and changing energy prices. The latter includes tests for the emergence of an energy market in China, factor substitution and demand for energy, and technological change and the determinants of energy intensity. 
        The main findings are as follows. China’s energy economy is still underdeveloped. It is crucial to review China’s energy situation in the new millennium. Energy, industrial deregulation and price reforms have been fast in China since the early 1990s. Empirical investigations have found evidence for the emergence of an energy market economy in China. The estimates demonstrate that there appears to be significant substitution possibilities between energy and labor when compared with international findings. Significant effects of substitution mainly come from the adoption of labor-intensive technology. Coal and electricity are significantly substitutable, while the demand for energy is elastic, in general. Finally, decomposing energy intensity shows that the budget constraint (a kind of price effect) reduces energy intensity while technological change increases energy intensity.  
       These findings bring us to the following major implications. Firstly, it is important to understand the potential effect of new energy regulation and pricing mechanism on the future directions of China’s energy economy, which suggests that former predictions of China’s energy demand may have to be significantly discounted, and the potential effect on the global energy markets and emissions may need to be re-evaluated. Secondly, significant substitution between energy and labor is potentially good news as China possesses some of the most abundant labor sources in the world. However, because capital more easily substitutes for energy than labor, more policy incentives are needed for labor to substitute for energy. Thirdly, significant substitution between coal-electricity suggests that the effects of environmental taxes, however, may be smaller than expected due to the fact that most primary energy coming from coal. Also any shift from coal to electricity implies more investment in transmission lines rather than railways. Fourthly, energy constraints on energy supply may only slightly impede economic growth in China because the elasticity of substitution between energy and other factors is quite large compared to internationally. Fifthly, while many factors are responsible for the inelasticity of demand for energy, rising income may be one of the most important given the high levels of energy prices. Increasing energy prices may be unable to constrain energy consumption at present. Thus other energy policies need to be considered to encourage or depress certain types of energy consumption. Finally, reducing exports of energy-intensive commodities, reducing the high-level energy-using sectors, lowering capital investment and constraining imports of second-hand and obsolete equipment, would all help reduce growth in energy intensity. Politically, however, this may be at an unacceptable cost to economic growth.
        Although this study has conducted a series of investigations into the institutional changes and consumption behavior of China’s energy economy, continuous updating required as more data is continually added in a highly dynamic and changing environment.

"3137","10092/839",,,"Anderson, Paul Joseph",,,,,"1993",,"The influence of laissez-faire ideology on economic policy in recent years has
been profound. Proponents of this form of economic liberalisation rely heavily on
antitrust, also known as competition law, to fill the void left by dismantled
regulatory regimes. In most situations, antitrust law provides a mechanism which
ensures that markets operate on a competitive basis and thus maximise the welfare
of society. However, in some industries, antitrust law is not sufficient to promote
and foster workable competition. This is of particular concern where the
uncompetitive industry has the potential to adversely affect a neighbouring or
related industry. This research analyses the computer reservation system industry
in Europe, North America and Australasia. It looks closely at the competitive
difficulties of the CRS industry and explains how these difficulties affect two
related industries-air transportation and travel agencies. A number of
conclusions and policy recommendations emerge. The triangular relationship of
inter-dependence between the CRS, air transportation and travel agency industries
makes CRS vendors unusually resistant to conventional regulation. Neither
antitrust law nor direct industry regulation are completely effective at preventing
airlines which own CRSs from exploiting their competitive advantage in one
industry in ways which anti-competitively affect trade in other industries. The
research concludes that for the Australian and New Zealand markets, a blend of
competition law and light-handed regulation is appropriate. For the United States
market, increased antitrust enforcement by the correct agencies combined with
active regulatory threats is required to create a fair air transportation market. The
thesis recommends a consistent world-wide code of conduct to promote global
airline competition. Such a code could then be adopted by individual states and
complemented by their competition law legislation.",,,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/2737",,,"en",,,"University of Canterbury.

"3138","10092/839",,,"Fleming, M. W. A.",,,,,"1985",,"The purpose of this thesis is to develop a policy towards anticompetitive
price discrimination in New Zealand. Price discrimination
occurs where the ratio of price to cost in two sales differs.
Legislation against price discrimination may be enacted as part
of our Competition Law, a set of laws designed to promote efficiency and
competition in industry and commerce.
The first section of this thesis examines the economics of price
discrimination and its effects on efficiency, income distribution and
competition. We conclude that the effects are ambiguous and depend
upon the circumstances in which the discrimination is practiced. However
we conclude that systematic price discrimination can be harmful to
competition, whilst unsystematic price discrimination can promote
competition and that there are a priori grounds for anti-price
discrimination legislation.
The second section examines specific approaches taken to price
discrimination legislation. Particular emphasis is placed on the U.S.
Robinson-Patman Act which is one of the most extensively litigated price
discrimination laws in the world. A review of the implementation of this
Act shows that it has failed to promote competition or increase
efficiency. In fact, it has done more to inhibit these goals than
promote them. We conclude that there are conceptual problems with antiprice
discrimination legislation and this conclusion is reinforced by a
study of the Australian price discrimination law. We therefore examine
the conceptual framework in which price discrimination is controlled in
other developed countries such as the United Kingdom, Canada, Eire,
France, West Germany and the EEC. We conclude generally that price
discrimination is a problem of monopoly and should be treated as such. The final part of this thesis reviews price discrimination law in
New zealand and suggests a policy that would align the Commerce Act with
our conclusion that legislation against price discrimination is
undesirable.",,,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/2736",,,"en",,,"University of Canterbury.

that cash flow analysis provides significant information for assessing
corporate distress, credit worthiness, portfolio management and
performance analysis. Six valuable and unique characteristics of
cash flow information; key to survival, relevance, wealth
maximisation, unambiguous, least susceptible to manipulation and
externally valid, contributed to its predictive ability. The study also
demonstrates that cash flow information is significantly distinct from

"3140","10092/839",,,"Hasseldine, Cecil Roy",,,,,"1976",,"A convertible security is an acknowledgment of debt (or preference share) which at a defined date may be converted into an ordinary share. The work begins by examining the characteristics of convertibles both overseas and in New Zealand. Chapter 2 suggests reasons for the rather late introduction of convertibles by New Zealand companies. A survey is made in Chapter 3 of 121 issues made from 1957 to 1975 by New Zealand companies and these are classified by year, type, interest rates and termination experience. An analysis is made of the use, and implications, of bonus issues of convertibles. The lack of options for the holder of convertibles issued by New Zealand companies coupled with the strong tendency for conversion to be at a fixed predetermined date renders valuation models developed overseas inapplicable to New Zealand. Alternative equations are developed in Chapter 4 and various uses for them are suggested.
In Chapter 5 the model developed for New Zealand conditions is compared with others - principally with that of Brigham. A computer program was written to plot actual convergence patterns for issues which had matured by the end of 1975. It is demonstrated that convergence from below has been the general pattern as predicted by the valuation model - in contrast with the overseas experience of convergence from above. Discounts between share equivalent and convertibles are demonstrated to be substantial, generally to exceed predictive discounts and to persist well into the life cycle of the convertible. Chapter 6 builds upon the visual viewpoint of Chapter 5 by calculating ex post yields of, and yield differences between, shares and convertibles. A second computer program evaluates yields to pari passu dates from the time of the first listings of convertibles. Yield differences were also evaluated to and from alternative reference points - assuming later investment and earlier disinvestment. The general pattern emerging is for substantial yield differences in favour of convertibles and these tended to persist even if investment was made as late as two years, or even one year, prior to conversion dates. Chapter 7 extends the study by using the equations developed in Chapter 4 to evaluate issues still currently quoted and with maturities in 1977 or later. A third computer program was prepared to evaluate yields under various assumptions regarding taxation and dividend growth. The chapter is intended to demonstrate the feasibility of applying capital expenditure techniques incorporating sensitivity analysis for price changes as well as the tax and dividend variables to the problem of choice between shares or convertibles. Matrix presentations are developed to enable investment decisions to be made when the taxation impact upon interest and dividends differs. Finally, the 'switching decision' with associated transaction costs is incorporated into the analysis. A brief examination is undertaken of the problems associated with classification of convertibles in accounting reports and of the dilution or other effects of convertibles on various accounting ratio measurements. The study shows that ratio measures presented by New Zealand companies are rarely, if ever, made on a dual basis disclosing the dilutive or anti-dilutive effects.

accreditation is significant, both in dollar terms and staff time. This thesis seeks to explain the motivations for business schools to seek accreditation with three major accrediting bodies, AACSB International, EFMD and AMBA, using a multiple-case study methodology underpinned by the frameworks of institutional isomorphism, bandwagon pressures and information asymmetry.
Interviews were carried out with 17 business school deans; five deans of accredited schools in Europe, five deans of accredited schools in the United States of America and seven
business school deans in New Zealand. All the New Zealand schools were either accredited, formally in the process of seeking accreditation or about to enter the application stage. The results provide supporting evidence for the notion that business schools are seeking
accreditation in order to achieve legitimacy benefits rather than performance benefits, and that intangible benefits are seen as having more importance than the costs involved with achieving accreditation. It was also found that where the focus is at an international level, accreditation is found to be underpinned by information asymmetries whereby schools are seeking to gain legitimacy by providing signals to the market regarding their quality. At a regional or national level information regarding quality is more well known and, instead, isomorphic and bandwagon pressures become evident as the pathway towards legitimacy. This study will be of value to business school deans in understanding the forces they are being subjected to when considering the value of seeking international accreditation. The results provide an understanding of why, in the absence of a formal business case, a school may consider such a move, or may have entered the process without the hard data that
identifies the costs and estimates the benefits in a measurable way. In this regard it will also be of value to all staff of business schools, and of the wider organisation, to understand the
phenomenon that is accreditation.",,,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/3755",,,"en",,,"University of Canterbury.

In the Assessed Taxes Act 1798, and the Duties upon Income Act 1799, William Pitt the Younger provided exemptions from those taxes for charitable institutions.  However, the legislation failed to provide a definition of charitable purposes with respect to either Assessed Taxes or Duties upon Income.  The problems for charitable institutions began when Addington introduced deduction at source in 1803, thus catching charitable institutions in the tax net by requiring them to claim refunds of Income Tax that had been deducted from their non-voluntary income.  To deal with the issues arising from such claims, Pitt created the Special Commissioners in 1805.  The Duties upon Income Act 1799 and its successors were only intended as temporary war-time taxes, and Income Tax was eventually repealed in 1816 once peace with France had been achieved.  However, Peel reintroduced Income Tax in 1842, based on the earlier Income Tax Acts.  Once again, Income Tax was intended only as a short-term fiscal measure, but that was not to be and, during the course of the Nineteenth Century, the Income Tax became a permanent fixture of the legislative calendar.  However, the issue of what was understood by the term “charitable purposes” with respect to Income Tax became an issue which, it was suggested in 1863, Parliament should resolve.  That was not to be, and it was not until 1891 that Lord Macnaghten, in Commissioners for the Special Purposes of the Income Tax v Pemsel [1891] AC 531 laid down the four principal divisions of charity that continue to dominate charity case law in the Twenty-First Century.  Until then, the exemption of charitable institutions from Income Tax had been a contentious issue.  Anthony Highmore, a London lawyer who was also very active in a number of London’s charities in the late Eighteenth and early Nineteenth Centuries until his death in 1829, proposed in 1786, that charities should be exempt from all forms of taxation. In 1863 Gladstone unsuccessfully challenged the exemption of charitable institutions from Income Tax, arguing that income other than voluntary donations should be taxed, and that governments should decide which charitable institutions were worthy of direct government funding.  However, charity case law continued to influence the decisions of the Special Commissioners until ultimately in 1891 Pemsel resolved the issue in a case which continues to resonate in the Twenty-first Century.  The question that this Thesis seeks to answer is, what was the rationale for the charitable purposes exemption from Income Tax that Pitt had provided in his Income Tax Acts?  I propose that the rationale was not founded in fiscal policy, or charity case law, but in social policy as influenced by the Evangelicals of late Eighteenth Century London, predominantly William Wilberforce and Hannah More, who were close friends of William Pitt the Younger.",,,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/3448",,,"en",,,"University of Canterbury.

"3910","10092/839","Pongpattrachai, Dichapong",,,,,,,"2010",,"For decades, organizations have used information technology (IT) to support their operational and managerial work.  However, the use of IT varies considerably from one firm to another. Successful IT implementation occurs when IT is diffused to all organizational members and is used to the fullest potential (infusion). Prior studies tested several IT infusion enablers. However, they did not yield statistically significant results. These studies hypothesized IT diffusion enablers as IT infusion enablers. The lack of existing literature on IT infusion made theory-testing research rarely yield a reasonable result. In addition, the definitions and measures of IT infusion offered by existing literature are not validated. This study aims to identify factors that contribute to the different levels of IT infusion in the context of spreadsheet use in small audit firms and to offer a definition and measure of IT infusion. While prior studies have discussed several enablers of IT infusion, they have typically proposed enablers of IT diffusion rather than IT infusion.

IT infusion is defined in this study as the use of IT to its fullest potential within a particular industry. Three aspects of infusion were identified in the prior literature. First, IT infusion refers to IT use within and across different business processes (extended use). For example, spreadsheets can be used to help auditors plan an audit, analyze data, and later create an audit report. Second, IT infusion refers to IT use in ways that establish the work-flow linkages within the work process (integrative use). For example, spreadsheets can be used to record data and the data is carried over for analysis and reporting. Third, IT infusion refers to IT use in tasks that could not be performed without IT (emergent use). For example, spreadsheets can be used to perform statistical analysis which cannot be done manually.

 The mixed methods research approach was chosen in order to provide a better understanding of the under-researched area of infusion. Use of theory-building approach from cases is likely to produce theory that is accurate and testable. Case studies are used for identifying IT enablers in real business settings.  Quantitative data is collected using the survey questionnaire approach.

In the first phase, a series of case studies were used to explore the concept of IT infusion in the audit context. All seven case firms were independent audit firms in Thailand with less than 100 employees. The firms helped identify a number of enablers of spreadsheet infusion. This study found infrastructure flexibility and training to be critical infusion enablers at an early implementation stage. At later stages, an IT champion, certain psychological factors, and social networks were found to be more important. The new measure was proven to incorporate all important IT infusion dimensions and to yield a reasonable range of scores enabling a complex statistical analysis.
 
The study also used a questionnaire survey to gather data on spreadsheet infusion from 203 audit firms in Thailand. Partial least squares (PLS) regression was used to test a research model that was based on the earlier case studies. The analysis confirmed the relationships among IT infusion enablers and the three pathways of use which formed the concept of IT infusion.  Task variety, an IT champion, and routinization were found to be directly related to IT infusion. Infrastructure flexibility, social networks, and management support were also found to contribute to IT infusion through other enablers.

It is recommended that future studies use the concept of task complexity when examining IT infusion. In addition, future studies should extend investigations on psychological factors of individuals that may affect organizational IT infusion.",,,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/3505",,,"en",,,"University of Canterbury.

"5294","10092/839",,,"Henry, K. R.",,,,,"1982",,"In a number of Western countries, imputed rental income on owner-occupied housing is not taxed. In some countries, tax treatment is even more/favourable, with mortgage interest payments and/or local property taxes being deductible against the owner-occupier's other income. These policies provide a tax subsidy to owner-occupied housing. The subsidy creates economic distortions; in particular, it encourages an inefficient allocation of productive resources, producing economic waste. In addition, it places an excess tax burden on capital employed in other activity, and on labour.
 The distortions created by the favourable tax treatment of owner-occupied housing suggest issues of theoretical and empirical interest. A generalized user cost of capital methodology permits straight-forward investigation of the subsidy to owner-occupied housing in several Western countries. The distortions created by the subsidy are revealed by the development of, and empirical application of, a static three-sector general equilibrium model of tax incidence. The three sectors are owner-occupied housing, rented housing, and other industry. The economic distortions are of different degrees in different countries, but are invariably quantitatively significant.
 Western governments are apparently persuaded by the dubious social arguments for owner-occupied housing. They are unlikely to be attracted by the ""first-best"" tax policy which advocates an equal tax on capital in all uses. The three-sector general equilibrium model permits the derivation of second-best tax rates, which minimize economic waste subject to the requirement that owner-occupied housing be subsidized relative to rented housing.
 The favourable tax treatment of owner-occupied housing has important dynamic implications. Removal of the subsidy would stimulate intermediate-run growth, assoc with improvements in resource allocation. In the context of long-run balanced growth it is pos to identify the (undiscounted) long-run utility maximizing subsidy to housing. These dynamic issues warrant further research.",,,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/4887",,,"en",,,"University of Canterbury.

The investigation is guided by a conceptual framework that explores the theoretical antecedents (e.g., human and social capital, motivation and risk) to portfolio entrepreneurship, how they engage in the entrepreneurial processes (e.g., opportunity search and recognition, entry and operational strategies) and the outcomes (e.g., business and personal) of their entrepreneurial activities. This is a qualitative study using a multiple case approach. Fifteen cases of portfolio entrepreneurs were selected and interviewed in-depth. Results show that portfolio entrepreneurs do have a distinct combination of human and social capital endowments, motivation and risk propensity. These antecedents allow them to formulate strategies that pave the way to portfolio development. While the reasons for the pursuit of the portfolio model vary across the different portfolios, it is evident that the portfolio is a result of the entrepreneur's opportunity and growth-seeking pursuits and a way to spread the risk inherent in business. The study reports strategies and heuristics that these entrepreneurs employ to manage the dynamics of a portfolio structure. At the business level, outcomes indicate that individual business benefit from being part of a portfolio. At a personal level, successful portfolio entrepreneurs do become high net worth individuals. Although financial motivation is evident at the early stages of their careers, money no longer features in later stages. Their satisfaction levels are high, and regrets are almost non-existent. They enjoy being in business and thrive in the many challenges that new products, systems, solutions and ways of doing things bring to the market and society.",,,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/878",,,"en",,,"University of Canterbury.

The condition for dynamic stability allows one to unambiguously determine the direction of the change in that price in the normal case on the formation of a customs union. New and conclusive results on trade diversion versus trade creation, the terms of trade, and welfare are then obtained.
 
 Subsequently the customs union facing fixed terms of trade is examined. A new condition on Trade Indifference surfaces is derived as a consequence of the restrictions necessary on individual utility functions for community indifference curves to exist. This information provides new and simple results for the small two member union which are generalised to small unions with an arbitrary number of members for tariff adjustments of any magnitude.
 
 It is proved that the composite goods theorem holds under distortions and may be applied to the many good small customs union. With many goods thereby reduced to two the results of the previous paragraph apply.

A notable feature of our market is the presence of long term financial contracts, or options. We model the energy spot market as a Cournot oligopoly, with a non-competitive fringe. The data from the Cournot model is used in an optimisation model based on Dual Dynamic Programming (DDP). The optimisation model produces operating rules in the form of a marginal water value surface, and these rules guide our medium term simulation model.
 
 We develop a method for using the Cournot model to produce Demand Curves for Release, which describe the amount of water the hydro manager would want to release in a given period for a range of marginal water values (prices). We show how DDP can be thought of as a process of adding demand curves over time, equating marginal costs between periods.
 
 We find that the efficiency of the market is greatly influenced by the size of the contracts, and to a lesser extent by the portfolio of plant that each of the firms has. Increasing contracts lead to increasing output, decreasing spot prices, decreasing profit, increasing consumer surplus, decreasing marginal water values, and increasing storage trajectories. With appropriate choice of contracts the market can be made to mimic perfect competition.",,,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/4503",,,"en",,,"University of Canterbury.

Two chapters consider duality in search. The conventional way of expressing a consumer's search strategy is to describe his decision variable as a function of the search cost. The dual approach is to find the search cost that leaves the consumer just indifferent between two decisions. Since cost is continuous this search-cost function is differentiable in more parameters than its inverse and so more readily yields comparative static results. Using this function it is possible to express the demand facing firms as explicit functions of the distribution of consumers search costs.

"4864","10092/839",,,"Lye, J. N.",,,,,"1990",,"In the standard classical regression model the most commonly used procedures for estimation are based on the Ordinary Least Squares Method, which is justified on the basis of well known finite-sample properties. However, this model consists of a number of assumptions, such as, for example, homoskedastic, serially independent and normally distributed disturbances and nonstochastic regressors. By changing these assumptions in one way or another, different estimating situations are created, in many of which the OLS estimator may have no statistical justification at all. Further, alternative estimation methods have often been justified only on the basis of their asymptotic properties, although in practice economists frequently have to base their statistical analysis on a relatively small number of observations. This suggests that the particular estimator to use in any situation should be chosen on the basis of finite-sample considerations.
 
 The analysis of finite-sample properties of commonly used estimators in three well known Econometric models is the focus of this thesis. In particular the three models considered are: the limited-information simultaneous equations model, the nonnormal linear regression model and the nonnormal limited-information simultaneous equation model. The techniques used include the derivation of the estimators' exact distribution and when this is analytically intractable Monte Carlo methods are employed.
 
 The limited-information simultaneous equation model is analyzed in two stages. First, a useful method of numerically evaluating many of the commonly used estimators, including the two-stage least squares estimator, is presented. Secondly this method is then used, and combined with Monte Carlo analysis, to compare the distributions of the limited-information maximum likelihood and two-stage least squares estimators in misspecified simultaneous equations models. The result of this comparison indicates the superior performance of the limited-information maximum likelihood estimator over the two-stage least squares estimator in both correctly specified and misspecified simultaneous equations models.
 
 Recently, models with possibly nonnormal distributed disturbances have attracted more attention. For such models, independence and uncorrelatedness of the disturbance terms are not equivalent. Using the nonnormal regression model the statistical consequences of distinguishing between independence and uncorrelatedness are considered when the disturbances are Student-t distributed. The results obtained demonstrate that the distinction between the two assumptions is an important one and the consequences of making the wrong assumption can be serious. Consequently, specification tests are also presented which test for uncorrelatedness versus independence in the elliptically symmetric family.
 
 The nonnormal limited-information simultaneous equation model provides a relatively new area of analysis as there are few published results available on the effects of nonnormal disturbances in the limited-information simultaneous equation model. The objective here is to combine the themes pursued separately in the other two models previously considered. However, to narrow the range of possible models that can be examined, attention is focussed only on the exactly-identified simultaneous equation model. This model has a number of interesting features when the reduced-form disturbances are normally distributed. These features are illustrated and then comparisons are made with the same model when the distribution of the disturbances is widened to include the Student-t family. In this case, as for the nonnormal linear regression model, a distinction needs to be made between independently distributed and jointly distributed disturbances. The consequences of these different assumptions are shown to be important; specification tests relating to this distinction are therefore also presented.",,,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/4367",,,"en",,,"University of Canterbury.

"4862","10092/839",,,"Hopkins, R. W.",,,,,"1970",,"Economic requirements are never purely economic: they are always formulated within a wider social framework. Economic growth within a nation during any historical period is the result of an interplay between the institutions and patterns of behaviour it inherits from the past and the strains and tensions implicit in the potential of the existing body of knowledge. An institution of major importance in the Western world in this process of interplay is the public, limited liability, company. Chapters One and Two of this study are concerned with certain facets of the legal, economic and social status of the public company which appear to be of particular relevance to New Zealand. 
 
 A wide ranging complex of background features demands reference to any existing theoretical structure as a framework for analysis. Not unnaturally in this present study this reference centres mainly on contributions to the economic theory of the firm. Chapter Three is concerned with this examination, concentrating attention on three aspects: the theoretical recognition of the financial characteristics of industry and other groupings of firms, the role of accounting financial statements as an integrative force in the theory of the firm, and the recognition of some form of growth factor in assessing the performance and ultimate valuation of the firm.
 
 In recognition of the lack of a really effective theoretical framework considerable attention is directed in Chapters Four and Five, first, to the quality of the data for the study and second, to the extension of the boundaries as far as the methodologies applied. It is contended that it is by the application of a wider range of more powerful tools of statistical analysis to quality data that the rightful status of corporate financial analysis will be maintained.
 
 It is the opinion of some that the value of a theory related to economic growth lies not in its promise to yield precise predictions but rather in its capacity to bring an ever growing body of empirical data into analytical relationships. Knowledge of such relationships should then provide the basis for continuous revision and extension of existing notions regarding the important determinants of growth. The empirical work undertaken in Chapter Six attempts to explore such relationships with particular emphasis on groupings of companies according to industry, size and growth-rate characteristics.

 Relationships are conceptualised as a continuum spanning relationship initiation, through development to quality relationships. Relationship initiation is linked to the export and supplier selection literature to yield a dyadic perspective of the search and selection process. Theoretical relationship stages models do not fit the empirical data and a revised relationship development model is proposed.
 
 The continued influence of bid and vendor-related factors throughout export relationships raises questions about relationship marketing as a new paradigm and the 'death' of the marketing mix, as theorised by recent authors. The changing influence of these factors led to proposing relationship strength as a measure to position dyads on a relationship continuum, thus providing guidance on appropriate relationship tactics for each dyad based on its continuum position. Quality relationships are defined as a special condition of high relationship strength.
 
 This study reveals that exporters lack understanding of the importers' perspective of the relationship and the factors important to importers' decision making. Therefore, the propensity of researchers to use surveys of exporters to understand performance provides an incomplete and potentially unreliable picture. Exporters must proactively seek an understanding of importer requirements and manage the relationship development process to provide robust export relationships.
 
 This study provides a fresh perspective on exporting and raises questions which can provide many years of productive research.

 There are three specific objectives of this research:
 (a) to characterise IT management sophistication in small business,
 (b) to develop and validate a comprehensive instrument to measure this construct, and
 (c) to develop a model that explains the relationship between IT management sophistication and the IT impact, in the context of small business.
 
 The characterisation of the construct is based on the work of Raymond and Pare (1992) who explored the concept of IT sophistication within the context of small businesses. This study adopted a multi-method investigative approach, combining both case study research and survey methods. The study population was New Zealand's small chartered accountancy firms. Initially, a pool of indicators representing IT management sophistication in small business was derived on the basis of case study analysis. These indicators were used as the basis for drafting the measurement instrument which was tested within a wider population in the quantitative phase of the investigation. The second generation multivariate analytical technique, Partial Least Square (PLS) modelling, was used in the study's survey data analysis phase.
 
 This research characterised IT management sophistication in small business under three sub-dimensions: IT planning, IT controlling and IT leading. These factors were represented by nineteen indicators. The validity and reliability of the measurement instrument was examined in the PLS data analysis. A PLS model explaining the relationship between IT management sophistication, technological sophistication, and informational sophistication on one hand with IT impact on the other, in the context of small business was derived.
 
 The characterisation of IT management sophistication in small business will be useful for the researchers to understand this complex construct more clearly. The measurement instrument can be used to examine further the different aspects of IT management in small businesses. The model that related the study constructs will aid understanding the associated links between them. Practitioners will be able to use these results to improve upon their IT managerial practices to derive a greater impact of IT, which can, in tum, result in achieving higher organisational performance.",,,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/4373",,,"en",,,"University of Canterbury.

"4867","10092/839",,,"Morgan, P. B.",,,,,"1977",,"This thesis considers several aspects of consumer search theory. The thesis begins by giving a history of developments in consumer search theory since its inception in 1961. Various failings of the literature are discussed and the implications of some of these deficiencies are established, In particular, it is shown that fixed demand restrictions can be incorporated into neo-classical search models only with difficulty,
 
 In Chapter 2 an examination of some earlier sequential search models is made. It is found that the restrictions placed on these models are logically inconsistent, except in circumstances which are particularly unusual, A sequential consumer search model, which is not limited by these restrictions, is constructed and compared to the earlier models criticised.
 
 Chapter 3 points out that the search literature has largely ignored the problem of a searcher's rational choice of a preferred set of sellers to sample. The effects of marginal financial search costs, transaction costs and information on sellers' behaviour on this choice are described. Some implications of the analysis for advertising strategies are presented, In addition it is shown that, in the circumstances considered, rational choice of search path results in the optimal sequential search strategy being myopic,
 
 In Chapter 4 a variety of statistical results are offered. The ex ante probability mass function of sequential search lengths is derived and some comparative statics results established. The ex ante probability density function of minimum observed prices resulting from optimal myopic sequential search is then derived, and its properties are compared to properties which it has previously been inferred to possess, It is found that some of these inferences are not generally valid,
 
 The Stigleresque type of consumer search model is substantially extended in Chapter 5 through the use of the indirect utility function. It is shown that the optimal search strategy cannot exclude the consumer's allocation decision 1 as previous analyses have done, and thereby relaxes Stigler's fixed order quantity restriction. Optimal search paths for Stigleresque searchers are described, Comparative statics results are determined which describe the dependence of the quantity of search undertaken on the consumer's wealth, psychic search costs and the nature of the searched-for commodity,
 
 In Chapter 6 a generalised search theory is described. This search behaviour is sufficiently general to include both the sequential and Stigleresque search behaviours as special cases. Consequently, the analysis of this chapter resolves the debate over the relative merits of sequential and Stigleresque search rules.

A number of different solution methods which have appeared in the literature are reviewed with an emphasis on the underlying concepts of the methods. The following chapter examines the solution of MODM’S from the other side, namely the behavioural aspects of decision making. Having gained an appreciation of exactly how people do make decisions I the intent of the thesis is twofold. Firstly, to develop new solution methods which can accommodate the decision maker (DM) in whatever his or her particular decision strategy is. And secondly, it is to empirically examine four solution methods with respect to users' preferences among them. Of these four solution methods, three are among the most well known in the literature and all can cite practical application.
 
 Two new solution methods have been developed. Both of these methods are based on a specific formulation of the MODM which is known as the maxmin formulation. The theory of the maxmin formulation is developed in Chapter 4. By using the Lagrange multipliers at the optimal solution, suitable pairwise tradeoff information can be presented to the DM. This forms the basis for the first solution method, which interacts with the DM as he or she progressively provides preference information. The other solution method makes use of a branch of Psychology called Social Judgement Theory and incorporates this into the solution method. This second method is especially applicable to the multiple DM situation. 
 
 In the empirical examination of solution methods it was found that one solution method was clearly preferred over the other three.

The theoretical framework adopted for the investigation draws heavily from the literature on portfolio choice surveyed in chapter 2, and in particular, from the monetary articles of James Tobin. The portfolios selected by the trading banks, the non-banking financial institutions and the non-financial private sector are successfully explained by variables representing real expected asset yields and the degree of credit rationing in the market for trading bank advances.
 
 A key variable influencing behaviour was found to be Tobin's supply price of capital, defined as that rate of return the community of wealth owners requires in order to absorb the existing stock of capital into its portfolio. Deviations of the supply price of capital from the marginal productivity of capital were found to stimulate the sort of responses expected from Tobin's articles. 
 
 The many time series constructed and drawn together for this investigation are described in appendix A. Chapter 3 analyses trends in the portfolios of the three groups listed above. Theoretical considerations, data limitations and institutional details are combined in chapter 4 to produce a macroeconomic model comprising 60 equations including 27 identities.
 
 The equations of principal interest in the model are estimated by two stage least squares as described in chapter 5. Because not all equations were estimated the overall specification and properties of the model cannot be comprehensively evaluated. Particular attention is given in the estimation procedure to the balance sheet requirement, that total assets equal total liabilities at all times.

strategic-management, such that the general theory of rational decisions

emerging re-integration, at the systemic level, of Economics with Ethics.
The new conceptual framework is then applied to: (i) the strategic

set of backward-looking rationalities, (ii) competitor-analysis and

 In Chapter III the natural-conjugate Bayes (β˜) and Ordinary Least Squares (βˆ) estimators for the linear model are compared, and a condition is derived and investigated under which β˜ is preferred to βˆ in terms of matrix mean squared error. In a limiting case a test statistic is obtained and shown to be related to another well-known test. Two observable substitute statistics are shown to be consistent but upward-biased. The bias is studied in a limited Monte Carlo experiment. 
 
 Bayesian inferential methods are advocated in Chapter IV for the seasonal adjustment of economic time-series. This is motivated by Chapter III and the application in Chapter VIII. A well-known classical procedure is shown to be a special case of the Bayesian method.
 
 Bayesian analyses of distributed lag models are surveyed in Chapter V, and Chapter VI considers the problem of discriminating between a Koyck distributed lag model and a regression model with autocorrelated disturbances. A Monte Carlo study compares several interpretations of an ad hoc rule-of-thumb proposed by Griliches with Bayesian Posterior Odds analysis, and the latter is found to be generally superior to the former. 
 
 Chapters VII and VIII present a Bayesian interpretation of the Almon estimator, treating theoretical results and an application to some New Zealand data.

"4917","10092/839",,,"Wan, Alan Tze-Kin",,,,,"1993",,"This thesis is concerned with the finite sample properties of some estimators of the unknown parameters in a linear model which is (possibly) mis-specified through the exclusion of relevant regressors. We assume that in addition to sample information, prior information regarding the unknown parameters is available in the form of a linear inequality constraint imposed on the regression coefficients. The combination of this type of prior information and sample information in specifying the corresponding statistical model leads to what has been identified in the literature as the inequality restricted estimator. If the statistical significance of the inequality constraint is tested prior to the estimation process, then the estimator thereby generated is called the inequality pre-test estimator.
 
 The properties of these estimators of the coefficient vector in a properly specified model have been examined rather thoroughly in the literature. In this thesis, we extend the results reported in the literature to the case where the underlying regression model is underfitted. We also investigate the sampling performance of the corresponding estimators for the model's disturbance variance, as well as the choice of an optimal size for the pre-test. The general background and motivation for this study are given in Chapter 1.
 
 Much of the earlier research on inequality restricted and pre-test estimation are built on results from studies that assume that the prior information is in the form of linear equality restrictions. We survey the relevant literature in this area in Chapter 2. Chapter 3 reviews the literature on inequality restricted and pre-test estimation. We focus on this problem in the context of the standard linear model with a single linear inequality constraint on the coefficient vector, as this is directly related to the theme of this thesis.
 
 In Chapter 4, we derive and evaluate the risk, under quadratic loss, of the inequality restricted and pre-test estimators for the regression prediction vector in an underfitted model. This analysis takes the established literature further by allowing for mis-specification in the regressor matrix. We consider the risk of the prediction vector, rather than the coefficient vector itself, so that our results are data independent. The risk functions of the corresponding estimators for the regression disturbance variance in the properly specified and underfitted models are derived in Chapters 6 and 7 respectively.
 
 As in the case where the prior information exists as linear equality restrictions, our results show that when the model is underfitted, the use of valid prior information does not necessarily guarantee a reduction in risk. This result holds for the estimation of both the prediction vector and the scale parameter. When one is estimating the regression disturbance variance, with an appropriate choice of test size, the inequality pre-test estimator can uniformly dominate the estimator that uses sample information only. We also find that the risk functions of the estimators of the error variance are affected more by mis-specification than are the corresponding predictive risks.
 
 In the case where no strictly dominating estimator exists, the question of the choice of an optimal critical value of the pre-test remains. Chapters 5 and 8 explore this issue when one is estimating the prediction vector and scale parameter respectively. We find that most of our results concur qualitatively with those reported in the literature when the prior information exists as exact equality restrictions.
 
 Chapter 9 contains some concluding remarks and a summary of the major results obtained in earlier chapters. We also outline some possible future research topics in this general area.",,,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/4506",,,"en",,,"University of Canterbury.

"5719","10092/839","Smith, Nicholas Ross",,,,,,,"2011",,"The EU, over time, has garnered international recognition and acclaim as a successful agent of democratisation in third countries. The transitions of Greece, Spain and Portugal in the 1980s coupled with the recent Eastern enlargements of the EU into erstwhile communist space attest to the success of the EU in fostering tangible democratisation. However, as the EU rapidly approaches its institutional capacity, questions remain as to its viability as an agent of democratisation in the post-enlargement setting where the EU can no longer offer full membership as an incentive for political and economic reform. This thesis attempts to examine the viability of the EU as a democratic facilitator in the post-enlargement setting, through examination of the European Neighbourhood Policy (ENP), a policy described by the EU as ‘everything but institutions’. Two mechanisms of normative transfer relative to the ENP were identified in the literature: conditionality, where the EU attaches incentives for successful political and economic reform, and socialisation, a newer notion whereby norms are transferred via interaction through generating close links with domestic actors. It was ascertained that in the context of the ENP, socialisation represented the dominant mechanism for normative change; conditionality was still utilised as a mechanism, however its scope had reduced greatly. To illuminate the phenomenon of EU democratic promotion, the case study of Armenia was chosen, a small but politically intriguing state in the EU’s Eastern Neighbourhood which had experienced (as is the case with the majority of post-Soviet states) stagnation and regression of the democratisation process since independence. Two facets of the EU’s democratisation strategy inherent in the ENP were chosen as empirical research areas: free and fair elections and interaction with domestic civil society organisations (CSOs). Free and fair elections offered evaluation of the conditionality aspects of the ENP through examining the 2008 Armenian presidential election. Interaction with domestic Armenian CSOs presented a rich phenomenon to examine the impact of socialisation in the ENP through utilising a case study examining four democratically minded NGOs. Ultimately, this thesis contends that through the ENP, the EU can no longer effectively wield conditionality as a viable mechanism of normative change and currently lacks the tools or a suitable environment to initialise normative transfers through socialisation. Consequently, it is argued that the EU has had little effect in facilitating democratisation in Armenia since the advent of the ENP.",,,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/5332",,,"en",,,"University of Canterbury.

Taking a comparative approach, this study of students at the University of Canterbury, New Zealand, investigates the decision to work during the academic term, the characteristics of such employment, and the perceived impacts on the university experiences of New Zealand domestic and Chinese international students. 

The study revealed similarities and differences between the two largest student populations. Compared to their New Zealand peers, Chinese international students are less likely to take term time employment. Among those who have worked, New Zealand domestic students do so for financial reasons, while Chinese international students value the work experience in the host country. Chinese international students receive much lower wages and tend to have shorter employment durations. In terms of perceived impacts, both New Zealand domestic and Chinese international students express a generally positive attitude towards their employment decisions, with a limited but clear awareness of the negative impacts. Interestingly, for those who have never worked, Chinese international students indicate a much stronger willingness to join the student workforce in the future. New Zealand domestic students, however, are much less likely to work if they can afford not to. 

This research provides empirical information about international students’ term time employment in the New Zealand context.

 This thesis is an exploratory study of collaborative relationships among New Zealand firms. The study focuses on improving our understanding of collaborative performance using a different methodological approach to those commonly reported in the literature. The purpose of this thesis is to develop theoretical insights into the area of collaborative performance.
 Decisions on design reflect the intention to capture managerial perspectives and remain open to new findings. This study follows an in-depth case-based design. Multiple sources of evidence are used to collect data for the 14 cases. Other salient features of this design are the use of theoretical sampling, inclusion of multiple collaborative forms, interviewing more than one partner in the relationship and obtaining a biographical history of the collaboration. The compilation of a detailed case summary for each relationship precedes the cross-case analysis. Key themes emerging from this process are then discussed as theoretical insights.
 There is empirical evidence to suggest that relationships with formal agreements are more likely to achieve relationship objectives. Formal agreements contribute to a clear focus, assist the conflict resolution process and encourage shared values and solidarity. Other such insights are detailed regarding relational variables, mutual partner assessments and the ability of global strategy to undermine collaborations at the local level. The ability of alliances in building firm resources, adaptability to environmental conditions and the issue of collaborating with competitors are also presented as additional observations.
 The theoretical insights highlighted in this study provide the basis for future research.

"6300","10092/839",,,"Walker, David J.",,,,,"1989",,"Theories of regulation are many. No single theory however explains the observed contrasts in regulatory behaviour and no clear criteria exist by which to identify a particular regulation as according to one theory or another. This is because there is no consistent theoretical structure which links the various approaches. Such a framework is constructed here.
 A partial equilibrium model of regulation in a competitive, negative externality generating industry is formulated and the concept of a regulated equilibrium defined. Regulatory controls over economic behaviour are ineffective without enforcement. In the absence of enforcement the regulated equilibrium coincides with the unregulated competitive equilibrium. Enforcement is by means of an expected monetary penalty. The effects of changes in policy instruments on the regulated equilibrium are derived.
 Within this otherwise identical framework two competing hypotheses concerning the aims of regulation are introduced, namely the Naive Public Interest Approach and the Capture Theory. Each objective is defined within the regulatory environment realizing that enforcement is costly. Optimal regulatory policy under each hypothesis is determined and policy responses to parameter changes are analysed.
 Most theories of economic regulation are set in a partial equilibrium framework. The implications for regulation and enforcement of the regulation's impact on sectors of an economy other than that which is directly affected are therefore not considered. These ignored sectors may, however, affect the outcome. In light of this the present model is reformulated in a simple general equilibrium context. Resource requirements for enforcement are explicitly considered in the derivation of the economy's regulated equilibrium locus of which the optimal equilibria under the competing regulatory hypotheses form a part. The behavioural characteristics of these policies are derived and compared. It is shown that potentially observable differences in regulatory policy exist from which the regulator's objectives can be inferred.",,,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/5874",,,"en",,,"University of Canterbury.

"5923","10092/839",,,"Vollebregt, Twan A. J.",,,,,"1996",,"Classical experimental design methods have gained widespread acceptance in the simulation literature. The simulation experimental design literature concentrates almost exclusively on factorial, fractional factorial, and composite simplex designs, which can be significantly more efficient than random or ad-hoc methods. However, there are several substantial differences between the classical (statistical) and simulation contexts that have received little attention. Most importantly, the design literature concentrates on obtaining maximum information from a set number of experiments, while in simulation we often wish to obtain a given amount of information at minimum cost. Also, classical designs and design methods generally assume constant variance and constant cost-per-experiment, while this is generally not the case in simulation. Hence classical designs are often not suitable for the simulation context. In addition, there are few rules to guide the experimenter in choosing an appropriate design, leading to quite arbitrary selection procedures. Thus although computer simulation is the ideal environment for which to develop experimental design software, the limitations of classical design methods mean that such software would do little more than perform routine tasks.
 In this thesis we discuss the main differences between the classical and simulation contexts, and propose and develop an alternative design approach that is often more suitable for the simulation context. The design for our approach is found by solving an optimisation problem, and includes an element of sequentiality. In conjunction with a proposed solution heuristic, our approach is easily incorporated into experimental design software that requires little input from the experimenter. A number of examples and a Monte Carlo study are presented to illustrate the properties of our approach.

However, while the number of reporters in New Zealand has continued to rise, the amount of assured reporters has been declining. This thesis seeks to understand why assurance practice is declining, what the causal factors are, and why New Zealand appears to be incongruent with rising levels of international assurance practice. It also aims to discover what might drive increased assurance adoption within New Zealand in the future.
Through utilising a pilot study of the current trends in New Zealand social and environmental reporting and assurance over a nine year period, the extent of assurance adoption decline is documented. New Zealand's assurance providers, and the country's non-assured, formerly assured, and currently assured organisations are interviewed regarding their position on assurance adoption. Benefits and barriers to assurance, stakeholder use and need for assurance, material differences between New Zealand and international practice, whether assurance is poised to increase in the future, and what will potentially drive assurance in the future are investigated.
This thesis discovers several barriers to assurance adoption including: cost, lack of perceived internal and external value, lack of pressure from stakeholders, difficulties surrounding the assurance engagement, under-developed reporting, and assurance having a diminishing value over time. The benefits identified were not as strong as the barriers in most cases. Internal benefits were generally perceived to be greater than the external benefits, as organisations noted questionable credibility enhancement.
Overall, a lack of drivers for assurance exists. Lack of stakeholder pressure is the key overriding barrier halting assurance adoption. An increase in assurance adoption could eventuate if increased societal awareness and desire for disclosures, pressure from export markets, and a change in presentation and communication of disclosures occurred.",,,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/6938",,,"en",,,"University of Canterbury.

both leaders and followers. The literature on leadership is focused almost exclusively on the
leader perspective. The Leadership and Spirituality literature largely assumes positive
outcomes for followers and given the Messianic undertones associated with Transformational
Leadership in general and Spiritual Leadership Theory specifically, this research set out to
explore the perspectives of both leaders and followers as to both the positive and negative
outcomes of the leaders’ spirituality. An exploratory case study approach was taken with
primary data collected through 29 in-depth, semi-structured interviews with both leader and
follower participants.
The study focussed on three aspects drawn from the literature: Spiritual Leader as Person,
Power and Control, and Purpose beyond Profit. Limited conceptual development and
empirical evidence, uncovered a number of assumptions within the literature. Three central
themes emerged from the research findings: Emotional Safety, Value Alignment and Blurred
Boundaries. The results found that both leaders and followers agreed that the effects of the
leaders’ spirituality were a culture of freedom, the need to navigate through ambiguity,
stimulation of whole brain thinking and a connection to a higher purpose. However, they both
interpreted these effects differently.
The results indicate that concepts of individual spirituality create tensions within
organisational realities. The practical implications of this study include the need for
organisations to create shared moral standards in which to address tensions between allowing
spaces for existential meaning making and in preventing against perceptions of unfairness
due to leader discretion in decision making. Secondly, if spiritual freedom is to be provided
to leaders and followers by organisations then the potential for followers to experience
inconsistencies between expected leader behaviours and assumed organisational values is
great. Lastly, the research would suggest that organisations consider a focus towards shared
organisational goals as opposed to shared organisational values, in order to allow for
individual spiritual freedom to be realised. Future research should include exploring tensions
between leaders and followers as a means of drawing out possible hegemony that may
influence follower and leader perceptions.",,,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/7273",,,"en",,,"University of Canterbury.

"8183","10092/839","Pinto, Antonio",,,,,,,"2013",,"Problems with storm water runoff are becoming more frequent, and the main cause is the increase of impervious cover (IC). The imperviousness increases stream peak flows, changes peak times, and so changes the flood distribution. Several policies are used to manage flows and flooding; however most have been reported to be inefficient because land owners do not have correct exposure to price incentives and risk.
The main contributions of this thesis are an investigation into market mechanisms to price and allocate impervious cover allowances, while managing flood distribution. The market mechanisms are based on the electricity and gas markets which use linear programming formulations. This thesis develops three net pool market mechanisms: Det_MarketIC is a capped and deterministic market for IC, and Sto_MarketIC and Sto_MarketIC_Risk are stochastic market models with flood component penalties and risk positions representing the desired risk from the community respectively. Additionally, a gross pool market was extended under rainfall uncertainty, Gross_MarketIC.
The market design is an auction system with operational constraints and bids for IC allowances from participants. The system relates physical routed flows at nodal or control points to these bids.
The models clear the market by creating a demand (supply) curve for increments (reductions) in flows at specific places, and accounts for marginal changes in the expected flood damage and flood damage components. The market formulations estimate efficient allocations and prices. Decomposed prices from the market models are shown based on duality, as applied in electricity markets. The dual prices show spatial and temporal effects of flows, which impact at flooding areas. With Sto_MarketIC and Gross_MarketIC, prices account for changes in flood distribution.
With Sto_MarketIC_Risk, prices also account for the risk as CVaR in flooding areas. Thus, prices increase as binding risk conditions are tightened.
Finally, the net pool models are illustrated using hydrological and hydraulic simulators based on a small catchment located in Canterbury, New Zealand. Allocations and prices varied with the different models. Participants would face increasing prices in their IC allowances due to increments in flood damage.",,,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/7616",,,"en",,,"University of Canterbury.

"8275","10092/839","Birchall, Stephen Jeffrey",,,,,,,"2013",,"Introduction:
New Zealand (NZ) ratified the Kyoto Protocol in 2002, committing to prudent greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reductions. In an effort to promote public sector carbon management, in 2004, Clark’s Labour-led Government funded local government membership in ICLEI’s Communities for Climate Protection - NZ (CCP-NZ) programme. In 2007, the same Government, in tandem with efforts to price carbon and develop an Emissions Trading Scheme, through the Carbon Neutral Public Service (CNPS) programme, sought to move the core public sector towards carbon neutrality (Clark, 2007c). In 2008, the NZ government changed from a Labour-led to a National-led Government, and this resulted in a shift in its carbon emission mitigation strategy, including the termination of the CNPS and the CCP-NZ programmes. 

Purpose:
The research has two central objectives:  First, to determine why NZ’s newly elected National -led Government cancelled the CNPS and the CCP-NZ programmes; and, second, to determine whether despite the discontinuation of these two programmes and in the absence of Government support, will NZ government organizations continue to strive for carbon emission reductions and neutrality.

Approach:
This empirical research is investigative and probing, and comprises a series of semi-structured interviews with senior managers responsible for the delivery of the CNPS and the CCP-NZ programmes within their respective organization. The architects of each programme (e.g. the NZ Prime Minister and CEO of ICLEI/ Director of ICLEI Oceania) are also investigated in order to glean insight into the rationale for the ultimate termination of these two programmes. Fieldwork is informed by publicly available information that provides insight into Government’s rationale for creating and  discontinuing the CNPS and the CCP-NZ programmes. 

Narrative analysis and termination theory serve as the primary methodological tools for this study, providing insight into meaning, interpretation and individual experience as it relates to the dismantling of the CNPS and the CCP-NZ programmes.

Findings:
This study finds that though economic constraints and programmatic inefficiencies may have played a contributing role, political ideology is the primary rationale for the termination of the CNPS and the CCP-NZ programmes.

With the ideological shift towards strong neoliberal market environmentalism, Government support for initiatives like the CNPS and the CCP-NZ programmes has declined markedly, with the desire to demonstrate leadership in this area in complete retreat. Ultimately, notwithstanding the desire of some government organizations to continue with programme objectives, albeit with less priority, NZ public sector organizational resolve towards these goals has weakened.",,,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/7684",,,"en",,,"University of Canterbury.

To add to the severity of the situation are the concerns surrounding the difficulties associated with our abilities in defining what is meant by tax compliance, non-compliance and their relevant sub-categories. This study reviews both the international existing literature and New Zealand case law to examine how the concepts have (or have not) been defined over the years within particular studies and case law. The results are presented in the form of a critical literature review where the definitions (or descriptions) for the concepts are organized into tables, in order to compare how the definitions have (or have not) been ‘improved’ over the years. Lastly, this study discusses the implications regarding whether ‘universal’ definitions can or should be developed and attributed to each of the concepts in order to clear the murkiness between our understanding of the various concepts of tax compliance, non-compliance, and their sub-categories.",,,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/7609",,,"en",,,"University of Canterbury.

O'H.",,,,,"1961",,"This thesis is concerned with a consideration of the liability in tort of an occupier of premises in respect of injury caused to persons coming on those premised from defects in the physical state of the premises. The term “Occupiers’ Liability” as it is usually understood, includes the liability of an occupier of premises for an injury cases through current activities or operations being carried out on the premises. That aspect of the subject must be considered, but it is the peculiar and complex rules relating to injury arising from defects in the premises which will receive most serious attention. As will be seen, entrants on to the premises are divided into four categories, and a corresponding duty is imposed on the occupier varying with the purposes for which the particular person mad his entry. One of these categories, that concerning persons entering premises in pursuit of contact, is not separately considered. Both the rules defining the category, and the duty imposed on the occupier towards its members, are determined as questions of a contractual nature, and thus involve different considerations from the rules relating to the remaining categories.
 Some aspects of this subject have been considered in a number of important recent New Zealand cases, where comments have been made as to the unsatisfactory nature of the present rules. The aim of this thesis is to consider these rules, and to assess whether they are realistic and result in justice, or whether New Zealand should follow the precept of England where the Occupiers’ Liability Act 1957 has considerably changed the law.",,,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/8249",,,"en",,,"University of Canterbury.

"8986","10092/839",,,"Hooker, M. B.",,,,,"1965",,"This enquiry will attempt to establish the structure of a legal order in primitive Maori society and to describe its function and technique. I realise that such a project requires much more space, time and study than is practical here, but it has been endeavoured to sketch the lines of a possible method of enquiry. I therefore hope that the over simplification of the mas of source material available has been successfully minimized.
 The enquiry has been based mainly upon the method put forward by K.N. Llewellyn, more specifically in his postulation of the “law-job” as a functional prerequisite of any society. However, the writing if this learned theorist is not particularly clear in some places and therefore I have had to make some assumptions as to his exact meaning: as a consequence, it is probable that my interpretations are not the only ones possible. In addition, I have used the basic concepts of Hohfeld to give life and depth to the postulates of Llewellyn, and this has necessitated the interpretation of these concepts into a form thought suitable for the subject. Again my interpretation may not be the only ones possible, but at least they have the virtue of comparative clarity, thus enabling certain institutions of the primitive Maori to be approached from a legal angle.
 Because of the nature of this enquiry I have has to move outside the strict scope of legal theory into such diverse fields as anthropology, political science, sociology and philosophy. However, as Oliver Wendell Holmes pointed out as far back as 1899, it is now fairly widely accepted that jurisprudence can profitability draw inspiration and useful information from these fields. Theories of philosophy have, of course, determined theories of law since the time of Plato and, I might add, the same applied to the primitive Maori. It is also well to stress the fact, freely admitted by all but sometimes lost sight of by analytical jurists, that law does not exist in vacuuo but is part of what Priestly calls our “warm messy mammalian existence”.
 It should also be noted that he various rituals described have been peculiarly well documented. All Maori had comparable rituals identical in structure if not in form.
 Though there might seem to be an undue emphasis placed upon the spiritual and mental concepts of the Maori, together with an outline of their philosophy, this has been thought essential to establish those inarticulate major premises” necessary before any consideration can be given to the more technical legal forms. It is, in fact, the “making explicit the implicit philosophy” without which as F.S.C. Northrop contends, no analysis of primitive legal institutions could be undertaken.
 Finally, it remains for me to acknowledge my debt to Mr L.A. Baigent of the English Department, University of Canterbury, who read the final draft of this enquiry and affected many improvements. In addition I would thank the Library staff for their assistance and generous concessions.",,,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/8243",,,"en",,,"University of Canterbury.

"11914","10092/839","Ma, David",,,,,,,"2015",,"One of the major issues associated with taxation are the costs incurred by taxpayers when 
they comply with their tax obligations, this is particularly important for smaller business 
taxpayers. Compliance costs are found to be regressive, falling with disproportionate 
severity on smaller businesses. This trend can be found across the globe and more 
importantly, in New Zealand. Prior research has shown that the severity of the 
regressiveness has increased over time. The current, “one-size-fits-all”, approach used in 
the New Zealand tax system, and others alike, have created undue complexity for small 
businesses. This study reviews small business tax regimes and concessions currently 
implemented (or proposed) in different countries to relieve the compliance burden for 
smaller businesses. Australia, South Africa, the United Kingdom and the United States 
have either implemented a separate tax regime, or offers tax concessions to smaller 
business taxpayers. New Zealand on the other hand, presents minor ad hoc tax 
concessions for small business taxpayers, but since 2009, there have been proposals to 
change this system. This study evaluates and compares all the implemented (or proposed) 
regimes and concessions of the selected countries. Following from the case studies, 
interviews are conducted with tax professionals that have worked closely with smaller 
businesses, in order to shed light on the possibility of implementing a similar regime in 
New Zealand. The findings show that a small business tax regime has many avenues to 
consider, however, there is general consensus that suggests small business taxation should 
be kept as simple as possible. This thesis puts forward a baseline for further discussion 
and development of a small business regime to reduce compliance costs for smaller 
businesses.",,,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/10457",,,"en",,,"University of Canterbury.

"8987","10092/839",,,"Maples, Andrew J.",,,,,"1993",,"The purpose of this thesis is twofold. The first purpose is to discuss the expansion of the concepts of income and business and the corresponding erosion of the concept of capital in Australia as a result of recent decisions of the Australian courts. The second purpose is the examination of the potential impact these Australian decisions may have in New Zealand on a specific area of taxation, the treatment for tax purposes of lease incentives.
 The thesis is divided into three major parts. The first discusses generally the distinction between the concepts of income and capital It reviews tests enunciated in various decisions on the assessability of profits and gains and deductibility of expenditure and outgoings. This discussion builds a foundation for the second and third parts of the thesis.
 In the second part of the thesis I discuss a number of the recent Australian decisions on the assessability of profits and gains and one decision on the deductibility of outgoings.
 The case of F. C. of T. v. The Myer Emporium Ltd. is perhaps the most important recent Australian decision on the nature of income and capital in the business context. In Australia it has led to a reappraisal by commentators of the traditional income - capital distinction.
 The other major Australian decision for the purpose of this paper is F. C. of T. v. Cooling. which decided that a payment made to a firm of solicitors as an inducement to enter into the lease of premises was assessable to the partners of the law firm.
 In the third and final section of the thesis, I consider the approach the New Zealand Inland Revenue, Taxation Review Authority and Courts may take in the light of the recent Australian decisions, in deciding whether cash and non-cash incentives provided to lessees are assessable. In my view the answer will probably depend on the form which the incentive takes. The goods and services tax implications of any such incentive are not covered in this thesis.
 To date the principles enunciated in the Australian cases do not appear to have crossed the Tasman Sea. However the New Zealand authorities will soon have to address the issues which have been raised. The New Zealand Inland Revenue Department are currently reviewing the whole area of lease incentives. No doubt they are looking at the Australian decisions, in particular Cooling, with a view to their application in New Zealand.",,,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/8244",,,"en",,,"University of Canterbury.

This task of examination will be attempted by tracing the development if the doctrine to its modern form, by considering the attempts which have been made to evade its operation, by discussing its effect on the company and on third parties and by comparing its operation and effect with other corporate bodies. It is hoped that by analysing every aspect of the doctrine, its advantages and disadvantages will be apparent and that a correct assessment of its value can be made. The inevitable conclusion it is submitted, will be that the doctrine has become not only worthless, but a hindrance to freedom of commercial transactions.",,,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/8246",,,"en",,,"University of Canterbury.

"8990","10092/839",,,"Richardson, S. M.",,,,,"1982",,"The choice of law dilemma for international accidents is the subject of this thesis. Part A contains an outline and discussion of the traditional judicial approaches adopted for torts in general in various epochs by a variety of jurisdictions. The lex fori, the lex loci delicti and a combination of both, which is the traditional English approach, are considered. A selection of modern academic alternatives to the traditional rules follows. In Part B some legislative solutions both actual and proposed, national and international are given.
 It is the aim of the first two parts of the thesis to demonstrate that the law, especially in jurisdictions which follow the traditional English approach, is in an unsatisfactory state of flux. Whilst unification of the rules of private international law are seen as the ultimate goal, it is argued that there is a need for an immediate, albeit less ambitious, solution. Because of the dearth of judicial decisions in many jurisdictions it is suggested that legislation on a national basis be adopted. The aims of such legislation are considered and a proposed Draft Bill is presented in Part C.
 The Draft Bill is applied to a sample of decided cases to illustrate that if implemented at a national level it would provide an immediate adequate solution for international accidents.

"8991","10092/839",,,"Tarr, Anthony Ashton",,,,,"1982",,"A competitive marketplace for goods, services and associated credit is in no small measure dependent upon the existence of adequately informed consumers. Consumers who are ignorant of the full nature, quantity and price of items sold, or credit available, in the market cannot make a rational purchasing decision. Chapter I endeavours to place the topic of consumer information in socio-economic perspective, considers the necessity for government intervention in the marketplace and outlines basic objectives of consumer protection legislation.
 Chapter II is devoted to business self regulation with emphasis being placed upon the codes of advertising practice. While it is recognised that self regulatory schemes exhibit considerable potential to advance the consumer interest, self regulatory codes of conduct and practice suffer through incomplete subscription to such codes and through inadequate sanctions for enforcement. This dictates that self regulation alone is not enough and that legislative intervention and control is essential.
 The consumer is accorded a comprehensive and diverse bundle of rights by statute and at common law and Chapter III examines the nature and extent of the consumer's remedies as against an advertiser, seller, etc. Given the dependence of substantive rights on procedural rights, it is argued that the real measure of benefit conferred lies in the ease of implementation of these rights, or otherwise. Consideration is given to small claims tribunals as important low cost forums for the settlement of disputes and to class and representative actions.
 Chapter IV discusses statutory control of advertising in New Zealand and liberal reference is made to the regulation of advertising in the United States where considerable development has occured in the fields of corrective advertising and advertisement substantiation. It is suggested that New Zealand could benefit by the promulgation of rules designed to achieve these ends. Furthermore, it is pointed out that control over the genus of unfair advertising is at best partial and it is suggested that the legislature take appropriate steps to remedy deficiencies in this area.
 The disclosure of information outside the advertising arena is examined in Chapter V and, in particular, attention is focused on the mandatory disclosure regime introduced by the Credit Contracts Act 1981 and on packaging and labelling laws. The valiant efforts of organisations such as the Consumers' Institute who disseminate much useful information relating to goods, services and credit, is discussed.
 In conclusion it is argued that various measures be implemented to improve the quantity and quality of information available in the New Zealand market and to this end it is proposed that a new Consumer Information Act be enacted. It is also submitted that this legislation, and other consumer protection legislation, be administered under the umbrella of a Consumer Affairs Department.",,,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/8248",,,"en",,,"University of Canterbury.

"9103","10092/839","Harre, Thomas David Andrew",,,,,,,"2013",,"The fishing industry is worth approximately $1.4 billion annually to the New Zealand economy, making seafood New Zealand's fifth largest export earner, and giving the industry as a whole a position of high importance to New Zealand. All is not well however. Recent events have exposed a sordid underside to this industry involving the abuse of labour of foreign fishermen at the hands of Korean boat owners, chartered by New Zealand companies to fish New Zealand waters.
Since the introduction of the quota management system in the 1980s, the New Zealand fishing industry has had problems relating to the exploitation of migrant workers. In some instances, this exploitation appears to be manifested in the form of human trafficking. Adopting a socio-legal methodology, this thesis examines the facts that support claims of human trafficking of economically vulnerable fishers from countries such as Indonesia and the Philippines into New Zealand, where they are required to work in exploitative conditions upon foreign charter vessels in New Zealand's exclusive economic zone.
Having established the argument for the existence of human trafficking in New Zealand's territory (a claim which has been consistently downplayed or denied by government officials) this thesis then examines the evolving nature of the legal obligations that have been placed upon the New Zealand government by international law.
Combining these international obligations with standards of best practice that have been derived from an examination of three other jurisdictions - Australia, the United Kingdom and the United States of America - into a set of benchmark criteria, this thesis concludes with a critical assessment of the New Zealand anti-trafficking framework by these standards.",,,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/8377",,,"en",,,"University of Canterbury.

A key factor impacting ES implementation lies with the influence of organisational cultures and subcultures which may enable or hinder such implementations. Existing research has focused on culture as being a stable, homogenous variable and little consideration has been given to the dynamics of cultural and organisational change during ES implementations. This study uses eight cultural dimensions (Detert et al, 2000) to examine instances of dialectic conflict between opposing cultural values and how these can impact ES implementations. This study uses data drawn from four case studies of large organisations that had implemented ES. The results identified five cultural dimensions where there was evidence of a cultural conflict between each organisation and the ES implementation. The results also found evidence that different subcultures within the organisation operated in different ways to facilitate or impede the adoption of the system. The evidence showed that the implementations resulted in cultural changes within each organisation to reflect the values embedded in the ES. This research therefore provides valuable insights into the cultural effects of large-scale implementations at an organisational level and shows that such effects are not necessarily homogenous and may vary due to the cultural values of subgroups involved.",,,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/8795",,,"en",,,"University of Canterbury.

"10193","10092/839","Truong, Van Dao",,,,,,,"2014",,"This research examines the interrelationships between tourism, poverty alleviation, and social marketing. It argues that tourism growth is necessary but insufficient by itself to alleviate poverty. Although tourism has often been connected with poverty under the rubric of pro-poor tourism (PPT), limited research has investigated this from the poor’s perspective. Little is also known of various poverty causes, including poor people’s behaviours in affecting poverty. Although tourism may contribute to alleviating poverty, negative poverty-related behaviours (e.g. depletion of natural resources) are still found in some host destinations. Where behaviour change is considered significant for tourism to help alleviate poverty, social marketing may be important given its potential in motivating voluntary behaviour change. This is particularly necessary for a developing country such as Vietnam, where tourism is encouraged for poverty alleviation. The district of Sapa, Vietnam is chosen as a case study area, which has substantial levels of poverty although tourism has developed for years. This research seeks to answer four main questions: What are the barriers to poverty alleviation identified by PPT projects in Vietnam? What are the roles of social marketing in PPT projects in Vietnam? What are the barriers to poverty alleviation identified by PPT projects as perceived by local people and key informants in Sapa? What are the roles of tourism as a means of poverty alleviation as perceived by the locals in Sapa?    

This research was designed in two stages. The first involved a content analysis of tourism-related projects in Vietnam, where a systematic search for project documents was conducted. Forty-five projects were found and then analysed against a set of six social marketing benchmark criteria. Twenty-one projects were judged to meet all the criteria, most of which were implemented in national parks (NPs) and nature reserves (NRs) that are home to important resources for tourism. Typical project objectives included preventing or mitigating local people’s dependence on natural resources and promoting tourism as an alternative livelihood. The most popular competing factors identified were local people’s poor perception of conservation needs and traditional dependence on natural resources, stakeholder conflicts, and weak policy implementation. This stage suggested that social marketing might help tourism contribute to natural resource conservation and poverty alleviation. The second stage utilised both qualitative and quantitative methods. Interviews were conducted with 47 poor people and key informants in Sapa. A survey was then administered with 187 local people. It identified that local people perceive poverty as a lack of rice and/or income and attribute it to internal and/or external causes. Tourism holds important potential for poverty alleviation in Sapa. However, this potential is substantially reduced by barriers to business development, employment, and thus benefit distribution within the sector. It is also worsened by the exclusion of poor people from development plans, decision-making processes, and project design and implementation. The non-poor and tour operators are perceived as the main beneficiaries of tourism. Local women often follow tourists to sell handicrafts, resulting in discomfort for tourists and conflicts among community members. More local people consider tourism a contributor to poverty alleviation and wish to participate in tourism. The most critical barriers preventing participation include insufficient knowledge, skills, work experience, funds, and poor foreign language proficiency. Limited capital and farming land is the most important obstacle to poverty alleviation overall.     

This research suggests that to maintain the long-term viability of tourism in Sapa, social marketing can be used to promote behaviour change in handicraft sellers and forest resource dependents. To this end, alternative livelihoods other than tourism are required. There is a need to put in place a policy framework that entitles poor people to more land in the forest so that they can grow more rice and medicinal fruit and protect their own forestland. Social marketing can also promote changes in the self-interested practices of tourism businesses and relevant forest policies. In addition, an appropriate intervention framework should be established to reduce household sizes and thus mitigate land use pressures. From a local perspective, this research helps planners, managers, and policy-makers in Sapa as well as other similar destinations in Vietnam and elsewhere understand more clearly the barriers to poverty alleviation and the obstacles to poor people’s participation in tourism. It also generates greater awareness among academics and the public in Vietnam regarding the potential of social marketing for alleviating poverty through tourism. On a broader scale, this research enriches and deepens tourism scholars and practitioners’ understanding of the various ways social marketing can help alleviate poverty and protect natural resources. Furthermore, given the centrality of poverty alleviation to the sustainable development agenda, the findings of this research contribute to wider social scientific debate, practical development discourse and, as such, to Vietnam’s society as a whole. This research concludes that only by valuing the perspectives of poor people can meaningful approaches to alleviating poverty through tourism become clearer and more likely to succeed.",,,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/9244",,,"en",,,"University of Canterbury.

"11062","10092/839",,,"Kerdemelidis, Savvas",,,,,"2014",,"The cost of medicines imposes a significant financial burden on society, with New Zealand spending $783.6 million between 2012 and 2013 alone. The majority of these costs are due to the monopoly prices charged for new patented drugs. The pharmaceutical industry argues that these high prices are necessary to recover the costs of drug development, which can exceed a billion dollars for a single drug. Because new medicines are relatively cheap to reverse-engineer and manufacture, in absence of a minimum period of exclusivity provided by patents, it is alleged that it would not be commercially viable to develop new medicines.

Most criticisms of the patent system relate to the high prices charged for patented medicines. However, there is another issue which has received limited academic commentary to date, namely, whether the pharmaceutical industry’s reliance on patents means that otherwise socially valuable medical therapies are being screened out or ignored, and whether alternative incentive mechanisms are needed to address this problem.

The aim of this thesis is to address this issue. First, the laws applicable to patentability and regulatory approval of new medicines will be discussed, with a focus on New Zealand and the United States. Second, evidence will be provided for the existence of three broad categories of medical therapies which lack private incentives for development under the current patent system: unpatentable therapies, unmonopolisable therapies and unprofitable therapies. Other problems with the reliance on patent monopolies will also be discussed. Third, the process of pharmaceutical reimbursement that is used to determine the price of medicines under the current system will be described, and a set of criteria will be proposed for an ideal incentive system, against which the current system is compared. Fourth, alternative incentive mechanisms for medical therapies comprising exclusivity-based ‘pull’ incentives, prize-based ‘pull’ incentives, and publicly funded ‘push’ incentives, will be analysed and ranked against these ideal criteria. This thesis concludes by proposing two legislative frameworks as part of an optimal incentive system alongside the current patent system, namely, extended regulatory exclusivity for incentivising unpatentable therapies and a prize-based mechanism combined with increased public funding for incentivising unmonopolisable and unprofitable therapies.",,,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/9826",,,"en",,,"University of Canterbury.

"10613","10092/839","Faroque, Anisur Rahman",,,,,,,"2014",,"International entrepreneurship (IE) exists at the interface of two distinct research fields - entrepreneurship and international business (IB). However, IE studies typically fail to integrate research from both fields, leaning much more towards IB. This study uses core concepts from entrepreneurship to explain the export performance of early internationalising firms. It contributes to the network and international opportunity-based view in IE by incorporating the twin concepts of exploration and exploitation into a dynamic capability perspective, showing how these affect export performance.
While early internationalising firms including born globals constitute an important component in IE, empirical interest in this field focuses on high-tech and knowledge-intensive industries from developed countries. In addition, research in the field is mainly of qualitative nature investigating small numbers of firms. Therefore, much is unknown about how early internationalising firms differ in their dynamic network capabilities and opportunity related capabilities. We investigate these aspects using structural equation modelling based on a sample of 647 SMEs and large, young and mature export start-ups operating in the traditional low-tech apparel industry from a South Asian developing country (Bangladesh).
This study shows that both network exploitation and exploration capabilities positively influence international opportunity exploitation and exploration capabilities. In turn, international opportunity exploitation and exploration capabilities influence export performance. This study also demonstrates that the relationship between network capabilities and export performance is both direct and indirect through the mediation of the twin international opportunity capabilities.
The moderation analysis of firm age and size sheds additional light on the liabilities of newness and smallness of early internationalising firms. Interestingly, we find that the liabilities of smallness and newness do not have the same influence in different stages of IE. The role of firm size is more pronounced at the earlier stage of IE.  In contrast, firm age accentuates in the later stage of the twin opportunity capabilities-export performance relationship. One possible explanation of this may be that developing and managing networks for the purpose of exploiting and exploring international opportunities is the most effortful and resource demanding stage in the entrepreneurial process. During this stage, owner-managers assess their own organisational resources, explore the possibilities of attracting external network resources and match their own resources with those of network partners. This stage reflects what is called ""resource orchestration"" in the strategic entrepreneurship literature. In the later stage, when opportunities are already developed and exploited, only minimal resources are then needed to achieve performance advantage. Age becomes a dominant factor because older firms derive greater performance advantage than younger firms due to their accumulated experience and learning throughout the years. 
This study indicates that firms may overcome their liability of smallness by connecting with new foreign partners, especially customers, resulting in more export orders.  Policy makers can also help them connect with new partners by organising trade fairs, trade missions and sponsoring other promotion programmes. With respect to the liability of newness prevailing in the later stage, owner-managers should work with prominent business partners to help them get good referrals and overcome the lack of legitimacy in establishing new relations. Finally, the managers of early internationalising firms should be empowered to develop relationships with external partners.",,,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/9639",,,"en",,,"University of Canterbury.

"10697","10092/839","Ward, Gerald",,,,,,,"2014",,"This thesis examines the relationship between Chief Executive Officer (CEO) origin and performance consequences in a New Zealand (NZ) setting. The NZ setting is unique because previous research on this topic is from the United States (US) and in one instance the United Kingdom (UK); and the NZ setting is intriguing because it has four important institutional differences: NZ directors hire outsiders much more frequently than their US and UK counterparts; NZ has no discernible trend in the frequency of outsider appointments over time, whereas the US has a marked upward trend; average CEO tenure in NZ is much shorter than that observed in the US or globally; and CEO succession occurs in relatively small firms. These four differences suggest that the NZ CEO market has some unique dynamics and perhaps unique performance consequences. This thesis fills a gap in our knowledge of executive and director practice in NZ and contributes to the CEO origin debate by analysing a new setting.

Using a hand collected sample of 162 CEO appointments from NZ firms between 1991 and 2008, I find some significant performance differences between insider and outsider CEOs. Outsiders elicit a higher abnormal return around the appointment announcement: the 1-day and the 3-day differentials are approximately 1.2% and 1.7% respectively. In contrast, insiders create more shareholder wealth during their first three years in charge: insiders increase the appointing firm’s market-to-book ratio by approximately 27 percentage points more than outsiders. I also discover that insiders are around 37 percentage points more likely to last at least three years in the job. The main difference between these findings and those from the US and UK is that insiders easily outperform outsiders in the medium term. Also, I document an intuitive finding for grey insiders: grey insiders by definition possess a blend of insider and outsider attributes and perform between insiders and outsiders on all three performance measures. These findings are robust to various controls and subsamples, and there is also some evidence that the market-to-book finding is robust to selection bias.",,,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/9663",,,"en",,,"University of Canterbury.

"12842","10092/839","Mack, Hugh Jonathan Devereux",,,,,,,"2015",,"This study investigated the normalisation of gambling within the New Zealand context to explore whether an ausugenic environment exists, using qualitative interviews in combination with a self-ethnography.  An ausugenic environment is one where gambling has become embedded in the cultural attitudes and behaviour of a society to the extent that it is no longer considered to be an abnormal or noteworthy activity.

In order to investigate this two phases of qualitative interviews were conducted with the first being with members of the public who were also asked to record a diary of gambling related things they noticed over the course of a weekend. To better understand the results for diary participant responses, the researcher underwent the same diary keeping process during the same weekend while also revisiting locations described by the participants to validate their reports. The second phase involved interviews with counsellors from the Problem Gambling Foundation of New Zealand to explore their attitudes towards gambling and experiences that their clients who were most affected by gambling in New Zealand. 
The outcomes of this research were two conceptual models that propose how individuals normalise gambling behaviour personally as well as how society both creates and perpetuates an ausugenic environment. 

This study also discusses the concept of environmental normalisation as a development upon advertising wearout theory. It suggests that individuals may become blind to attitudes and stimuli within their environment after prolonged periods of exposure through many different sources. The idea that this may be not simply something that advertisers seek to avoid as is classically thought, but implemented as a deliberate strategy for organisations seeking to gain wide acceptance of their product or service is also proposed. 

The study ten seeks to make significant contributions towards the betterment of society through use of the findings to recommend policy alterations the New Zealand Government should implement and suggest alternative ways that the treatment of problem gambling is addressed in future.",,,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/11033",,,"en",,,"University of Canterbury.

"11760","10092/839","Najib, Hedayatullah",,,,,,,"2015",,"New Zealand is rapidly becoming a strongly multicultural society with nearly one in four of its citizens born overseas (Statistics New Zealand, 2006). Immigrants enter New Zealand under many different classifications, such as skilled migrants, entrepreneurs, investors, and refugees. Finding employment and a means of survival in their new society is an undeniable challenge for most, if not all, of these immigrants and people from refugee backgrounds. Some of them find employment in established Kiwi organisations while others establish their own businesses and become entrepreneurs. 
A review of the literature revealed that there has been considerable research on entrepreneurial behaviours of immigrants and refugees in general, but little is known about the experiences of entrepreneurs from refugee backgrounds in New Zealand, specifically Afghan entrepreneurs and how their experiences differ from their counterparts who came to New Zealand from other countries.
This qualitative research project studies Afghans (N=23) from Christchurch who established their own businesses and the sense they have made of their experiences, both as refugees and as business owners. It also briefly compares the major findings with those of their refugee counterparts from other countries (N=6) to see if there are any major differences between the two groups’ start-up experiences in New Zealand.
Participants were selected from those in the Afghan community in Christchurch who are from a refugee background, using a snowballing technique. The comparison group consisted of six refugees from Zimbabwe, Somalia, South Sudan, Ethiopia and Sri Lanka. 
The findings of this study have been categorised into two parts. The first part discusses the initial experiences of the participants in New Zealand society, how they settled into New Zealand, what strategies they used to integrate into their new society, how they financed their lives in New Zealand, and eventually how they became economically independent. The second part of the findings discusses the motivators behind the participants’ business start-ups, the types of businesses that they established and how these businesses assisted them as a gateway to other business ventures or activities. This section further investigates the challenges the refugees faced during their business start-up stage and the strategies they adopted to address these challenges. The data indicated that, while the Afghan refugees faced many challenges in establishing their own businesses, three were of particular importance to them. These were (1) financial challenges (2) licensing requirements and (3) English language ability for obtaining business licenses. These were different from the comparison group because of the different industries the two groups of business owners chose to start.
This research presents a very important finding. When participants’ experiences were examined to see how they account for personal and business success it was clear it is the social fabric of a collectivist and religious way of life and the associated sense of obligation to support each other that are the most significant factors shaping Afghan refugees’ business start-up behaviour. These factors led them to guide and mentor each other towards economic security and a lifestyle that fitted well with their family and religious obligations and self-identity.
In addition to showing how Christchurch Afghan refugees’ business start-ups were used as a means to meet their social objectives, this research and the model that emerged from it offer unique insights into three key drivers: economic security, lifestyle–enterprise fit, and self-identity. These factors, together with age and family circumstances, shaped the decisions associated with starting businesses in New Zealand to determine the pathway chosen. 
The findings of this research are important as New Zealand is opening its doors to more refugees and very little is known about more recent refugee groups like those from Afghanistan. The findings provide a rich and unique contribution to refugee entrepreneurship and enterprise development literature in New Zealand and a model that could be used as a framework for further studies on the subject by those agencies that support refugees and their business start-up ventures as well as government agencies dealing with refugee resettlement and employment.",,,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/10336",,,"en",,,"University of Canterbury.

These programmes took data from tax returns and other sources, and turn this into a series of financial benchmarks for specific industries. The data from these programmes was then published on the respective websites of Inland Revenue and the ATO. It was envisaged by both tax administrations that this data would be used by taxpayers to benchmark their financial performance against others in their industry. The Benchmarking Programme was designed to assist Inland Revenue with its compliance strategy and to better its their audits. 

This exploratory research was mainly focused on the use (or lack of) of Inland Revenue’s Benchmarking Programme by taxpayers and tax practitioners. Other aspects of the Benchmarking Programme were investigated. Interviews with six tax practitioners were conducted, supplemented by documentary analysis of the Benchmarking Programme and other sources of data. It was found that the tax practitioners do not use the data for several reasons, including issues with the integrity of the data and its usefulness. It suggested that taxpayers do not use the data from the Benchmarking Programme, and indeed may not have any knowledge of it. The overall impact of the Benchmarking Programme was deemed to be minimal.

"11790","10092/839","Seneviratne, Buddhakoralalage Leelanga Dananjaya",,,,,,,"2015",,"The overall aim of this study was to examine how the characteristics of two salient stimuli -music and message- of an audio advertisement influence the psychological state of consumers and how such a state subsequently determines their cognitive and affective responses to the advertisement. In achieving this aim, this study was  guided by a combination of two cognitive resource utilisation theories, Limited Capacity Model of Motivated Mediated Message Processing (Lang, 2000) and Resource-Matching Hypothesis (Anand & Sternthal, 1989). In particular building upon inconsistency and load theories, this study proposed that certain stimulus characteristics prompted certain states of a consumer’s cognition. These two stimulus characteristics were the congruence of musical stimulus and the complexity of the message stimulus. The model then predicted the potential effect of these characteristics on certain psychological states (Psychological Discomfort and Cognitive Load) leading to affective (Attitude towards Advertisement) and cognitive (encoding, storage, and retention) responses.

To empirically examine this model, an online experiment (using a 2 x 2 between-subject x 2 with-in subject mix design) was conducted, in which a mixed sample of 284 subjects was exposed to a set of audio advertisements especially designed for this study. Unfamiliar music in conjunction with a fictitious brand was used and the exposure level was maintained at low. ANCOVA, MANCOVA, two-stage hierarchical regression analysis, and Repeated-measures MANCOVA were administered to test the hypotheses presented in the conceptual model. Among major findings were that the multiple informational structures in a complex message positively influenced cognitive load, while congruent music was capable of attenuating the level of cognitive load. Incongruent music, on the other hand, was capable of generating a dissonance state experienced as psychological discomfort that in turn increased the level of cognitive load as a result of listener’s trying to resolve such a state. Both dissonance and cognitive load negatively influenced attitude towards advertisements, and the affect primacy of attitude formation appeared to be more applicable. Though high cognitive load clearly undermines encoding, storage, and retrieval processes, no evidence was found to support the Resource-matching Hypothesis. Furthermore, the findings suggested that the cognitive load offset by the congruent music would increase advertisement effectiveness by enabling its message to carry more information and by generating more favourable attitudes.",,,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/10252",,,"en",,,"University of Canterbury.

"10614","10092/839",,,"Arbouw, Paula",,,,,"2014",,"The overall aim of this thesis is to investigate the effects of coherence in the corporate branding process. Specifically, this thesis defines and develops the concept of corporate brand coherency (CBC) using four antecedents and four dimensions, and investigates the effects of incongruence based on the advertising antecedent by manipulating ad-brand congruence. Using the Elaboration Likelihood Model (ELM), the research tests whether two-sided messages aid the resolution of incongruence following central route processing and whether greater number of arguments could act as a peripheral cue. Accordingly, a conceptual model was developed to test the effects of ad-brand congruence, message sidedness and argument quantity on corporate credibility, attention and elaboration, attitude towards the ad and attitude towards the corporate brand.

To empirically test this model an online experiment (using a 3x2x2 between-subjects factorial design) was conducted, where subjects were exposed to a modified print advertisement for a grocery store. A total of 528 responses were collected from New Zealand Internet users. Two- and three-way ANCOVAs as well as path analysis was used to analyse the hypothesised relationships.

The results indicate support for CBC, as it was found that congruence led to positive evaluations and higher corporate credibility. Two-sided messages were not found to be effective in reducing the negative effect of incongruence. Instead, two-sided messages led to less favourable evaluations of incongruence. Regardless of the incongruence, the results show that two-sided messages did not lead to positive evaluations, while an increased number of arguments did lead to more favourable attitudes. Overall, the findings show the ELM is not applicable to explain consumers’ responses to incongruence, as incongruence was not found to affect message processing. Additionally, there was no support that message sidedness and argument quantity, respectively, acted as central and peripheral cues. Furthermore, findings indicate that incongruity in advertising can lead to positive evaluations when consumers have a negative prior brand attitude. The theoretical and managerial implications as well as directions for future research based on these findings are discussed.",,,,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/9697",,"en",,,"University of Canterbury.

The chronic difficulties experienced by many local authorities in their attempts to obtain capital finance were among the factors which induced the New Zealand Government (in 1957) to set up a Royal Commission to investigate the whole field of local authority finance and the Report of that Commission (presented in September 1958) provides the basis for much of this Thesis.

This calls for intensified sustainable practices within businesses of all sizes and industries. In recent years this resulted in a wholly new model called the circular economy. Inherent to this is the Cradle to Cradle framework which seeks to design and create commodities in such a way that the impact on the environment, i.e. the carbon footprint is neutralised. Significant efforts are currently being undertaken in Europe and the United States in various sectors with a recent focus on transforming the fashion industry. The literature finds that that there is generally still little known in this area, there was barely any evidence of this change taking in New Zealand. The objective of this research is to explore this and to eventually build a theoretical understanding to what extent Cradle to Cradle plays a role within the fashion industry. This was achieved by employing the grounded theory method. Data was collected by conducting semi-structured interviews with owners-managers supplemented by secondary data such as sustainability reports. In line with grounded theory principles, open and selective coding, theoretical sampling and constant comparison were used to analyse all data within the Nvivo 10 Software. The theory showed that somewhat severe resource constraints and an occurring loss of transparency by outsourcing manufacturing operations to overseas locations impede the shift towards the circular economy at present. This research contributes to sustainable development literature by providing a comprehensive model of how the uptake of sustainable practices is influenced and dependent on multiple aspects and therefore fosters the understanding of a complex, intertwined and intransparent industry.

Stochastic Constructive Dual Dynamic Programming (SCDDP) is a technique which has been effectively applied to the New Zealand system for optimization and simulation. This variant of Dynamic Programming (DP) allows optimization to occur in the dual space reducing the computational complexity and allows solutions from a single run to be formed as price signal surfaces and trajectories. However, any application of this method suffers from issues with computational tractability for higher reservoir numbers. Furthermore, New Zealand specific applications currently provide limited information on the system as they all use the same two-reservoir approximation of the New Zealand system. This limitation is of increasing importance with the decentralization of the New Zealand electricity sector. In this thesis we develop this theory with respect to two key goals:
• To advance the theory surrounding SCDDP to be generalizable to higher reservoir numbers through the application of the point-wise algorithm explored in R. A. Read, Dye, S. & Read, E.G. (2012) to the stochastic case.

"8294","10092/839","Hodson, Alistair Graham",,,,,,,"2013",,"Mr John George Russell holds a special place in New Zealand’s relatively brief tax history. He is a person who has challenged Inland Revenue’s authority and the taxing statutes more than any other individual. If Mr Russell had followed his father’s early advice and studied engineering he may have taken over the family farm on the outskirts of Hamilton and by now have been enjoying a peaceful retirement. Instead, his enjoyment of the accounting subjects taken at college, which he had enrolled into in error, ultimately led him to becoming a leading figure in the development of the then emerging New Zealand money market, and the managing director of the merchant bank Securitibank. Novel approaches to commercial issues and tenacity in litigation are the trademarks of Mr Russell, Auckland tax advisor and business consultant.
Mr Russell is well known in New Zealand tax circles as the creator and defender of the ‘Russell tax template’, developed in the 1980s as a mechanism to turn the ‘water’ of taxable receipts into the ‘wine’ of untaxed gains. Template related issues are still being litigated some three decades later. There have been many cases related to the template covering both substantive and procedural issues. Mr Russell has had limited success on procedural grounds claiming his wins have been the result of good luck more than anything else. He strongly claims Inland Revenue have run a vendetta against him for many years.
Inland Revenue have taken several different ‘Tracks’ when assessing various parties it considered received the tax advantage from the template. The ‘Tracks’ used to assess various parties are also regarded by Mr Russell as a vendetta tactic. Ultimately the litigation has led to ‘Track E’ with Inland Revenue personally assessing Mr Russell for tax, penalties and interest totalling in excess of NZD $200 million (underlying core tax of $15 million). A Court of Appeal decision found for Inland Revenue and confirmed Mr Russell’s personal tax assessment. Leave to the Supreme Court was not granted and Mr Russell has recently commented that a ‘Track F’ may now exist.
Mr Russell has accused the Commissioner of Inland Revenue of fraud in respect of backdated assessments, and Inland Revenue have accused Mr Russell of fraud in relation to backdated documents. Mr Russell commented during one of our interviews when challenged about document backdating that “the only difference between an honest person and a dishonest one is often a date.” This thesis attempts to provide the reader with not only an overview of the litigation associated with Mr Russell, but also seeks to provide an insight into the person of Mr Russell. The Russell tax template was held to be a tax avoidance structure by the Privy Council in 2001. I did not intend to debate the merits of the Russell template with Mr Russell.
One of the least known postures of Inland Revenue’s Compliance Model is that of the ‘game player’. It would appear that Mr Russell has many tendencies attributed to a person classified under this framework to be a classic game player. This thesis attempts to provide an in-depth overview of perhaps Inland Revenue’s most litigious taxpayer and asks whether Inland Revenue are now on ‘track’ to a conclusion. This thesis considers Mr Russell’s contribution to tax jurisprudence by looking at his journey over the last 30 years, giving the reader an insight into the life of Mr Russell.",,,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/7683",,,"en",,,"University of Canterbury.

Classification and prediction models are notoriously difficult to establish in such a way that they will stand the ultimate test of time. Many articles severely criticise the use of the technique yet there are aspects which may improve our ability to develop satisfactory models. We are probably yet a long way off from being able to do so with any great degree of satisfaction, yet it behoves us to try to develop models that do justice to the assumptions and the theory. This thesis explores several important aspects of the model-building process and concludes that some of the more conventional criticisms of the models developed so far are less important than claimed. It suggests that more critical than the failure to meet the conditions of multivariate normality, the equality of the variance-covariance matrices, and the use of a priori probabilities are the need for: a satisfactory model specification that can be theoretically justified, the strict use of random sampling, the efficient use of sample data, the search for stable mean vectors which are significantly different from each other, and ex ante validation.

It was found that detachment from an individual’s identity occurred, creating an impersonal and distant interaction free from the normal social constraints of the offline, real life environment. The study found that technological dehumanisation was evident, which proposes that individuals relinquish linkages to their persona as a means to subconsciously justify behaviours, which are contrary to the norms of society. Repercussions of this dehumanised interaction include reduced external power to manipulate and influence, and emphasises the importance of an individual’s internal power, such as self-efficacy, to control one’s persona such as likeability and expertise as a means to feel personal empowerment.
This study helps further the understanding between anonymous behaviours and behavioural power dynamics by identifying a new dimension to the behavioural discrepancies seen online.

"11942","10092/839",,,"Oxnan, D. W.",,,,,"1941",,"The aim of this survey is twofold. First, it attempts to describe and analyse the more important aspects of the Labour Government’s economic policy, and second, it attempts to demonstrate how the achievement of this policy is conditioned by the characteristics of the New Zealand economy. The economic policy of the Labour Government is important for several reasons. First, both the “recovery measures” of the previous Government during the depression, and Labour’s policy after the depression tend to show that New Zealand, in common with other countries, is experiencing a definite trend towards an extension of State control of economic life. Secondly, since the 1890’s the Dominion has indulged in economic and social experiments which have attracted the attention of economists not only in New Zealand but also abroad. The economic and social policy of the Labour Government thus appears to be an acceleration of this long term trend. In addition it is generally recognised that conditions in New Zealand are more favourable to economic experimentation than those existing in most other countries. In examining this policy it is of fundamental importance to realise that the Ottawa Agreements of 1932, mark the end of an era when New Zealand could confidently rely on a large and expanding overseas market for her exports. Moreover the rise of economic rationalism, the progress of agrarian protectionism, the developments in the alternative sources of supply and the declining rate of growth of population in the consuming countries, all have forcibly demonstrated the inherent weakness of the New Zealand economy. Consequently the post depression years have witnessed a conscious expansion of New Zealand’s secondary industries. Although the social and economic policy of the Labour Government is in many respects similar to that of the Liberal Administration of Balance and Seddon in the early ‘nineties’ of last century, it has certainly been carried out under far less favourable circumstances.
 It is mainly for these reasons that this subject provides a fruitful field for economic research.
 To cover the whole of the policy in detail and would be beyond the limits of a brief survey of this nature. It would be possible to write a detailed survey on any one aspect of the policy. Nevertheless, it is felt that a broad treatment of policy is not entirely unfruitful. On the contrary a wide survey has much to commend it, for a detailed analysis of one aspect only tends to lose sight of the nature of the policy as a whole.
 Thus the first two chapters are devoted to an analysis of the Labour Government’s Programme and the economic factors limiting the achievement of this programme. The remaining chapters are concerned with the development of policy. Separate chapters deal in turn with Monetary Policy, Marketing, Transport, Rationalisation of Industry, Import and Exchange Control, and Labour and Social Legislation. In a concluding chapter, the threads are drawn together and an evaluation of the policy attempted.
 It should be noted that the period under review extends from 1936 to 1939 inclusive. It does not deal with the policy after the outbreak of war in September 1939, because this has created new problems and has thus modified to a certain extent the direction of Government policy.
 At the outset, originality is disclaimed. Much has already been written on particular aspects of policy, but little if any, on the policy as a whole. The material has been collected from all available relevant literature, consisting of numerous pamphlets, periodicals, articles and officials publications. A detailed account of references is given in the bibliography.
 Finally it is not proposed to reveal anything which is not already known to competent economists. This survey merely aims to make a comprehensive and critical analysis of the economic policy followed by the Labour Government in the years 1936-39.",,,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/10483",,,"en",,,"University of Canterbury.

Consumer use of the Internet has increased immensely, and affects organisations due to the growth of consumer-to-consumer interactions, such as word-of-mouth. Word-of-mouth is a powerful form of advertising because of consumer trust in their social media networks, therefore, it is crucial for organisations to increase C2C sharing as a form of advertising, and in particular, co-creative advertising campaigns. 

To achieve this aim, this study used a grounded theory approach, to gather a comprehensive amount of data to discover theoretical propositions about the phenomenon. A total of ten unstructured depth interviews were conducted before theoretical saturation was reached. 

The results of the study found that consumer motivations to share co-creations online were pride, and to connect with others, conceptualised by social media self-presentation, and a consciousness of others. Whilst consumer motivations to participate in co-creative advertising campaigns were escapism and self-interest.

The primary implication of these findings is understanding how organisations can influence consumer motivations to share co-creations online, hence, organisations advertising, by increasing personal connections that consumers can use to connect with others in consumer-to-consumer platforms online.",,,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/10817",,,"en",,,"University of Canterbury.

"19397","10092/839",,"Rogan-Finnemore, Michelle",,,,,,"2005",,"The term ‘bioprospecting’ was only coined within the past few decades. Today, it is still difficult to find consensus on its legal meaning. What it appears to represent is the range of activities associated with searching for, discovering and researching unique biodiversity for any potential commercial applications. The polar regions are likely sources of such uniqueness. This is what attracts bioprospectors, as polar biodiversity often contain genes, molecules or compounds, that once isolated and assessed, can be developed into a product or process of commercial value in the fields of agriculture, medicine, aquiculture, cosmetics, and pharmacy to name only a few.

Bioprospecting in the Antarctic presents similar challenges to bioprospecting carried out anywhere else in the world. It also, however, carries with it unique challenges and implications specific to the Antarctic region. Bioprospecting has been underway in the Antarctic since the mid 1980s, within the context of National Antarctic programmes. Little formal debate, however, has taken place within the Antarctic Treaty System, the legal regime which governs the region. This thesis investigates the unique legal implications that bioprospecting has for Antarctica and the Southern Ocean. Antarctic bioprospecting also carries with it environmental and ethical implications. These will only be briefly discussed, but they too, carry with them legal obligations which are important in the context of the Antarctic.

The principle legal obligations are contained within the Antarctic Treaty; being the use of the area for peaceful purposes only, freedom of scientific investigation including the free availability of scientific observations and results, and the ‘frozen’ but unresolved sovereignty situation that prevails while the Antarctic Treaty is in force. Sovereignty considerations are particularly important when considering resource utilization and benefit-sharing from such utilization. Beyond the Antarctic Treaty, there exist international legal instruments which carry with them other obligations that cannot be ignored. Avoiding conflicts with these international instruments must also be a fundamental consideration in any Antarctic bioprospecting regulation. The extent of these legal obligations, and their implications for bioprospecting, is the focus of this thesis.

The thesis will explore these obligations and then investigate the possible future of bioprospecting in the Antarctic. Bioprospecting appears to be the latest challenge to the half century old Antarctic Treaty System. Each new challenge seems to prompt a call to investigate the system itself. So that every challenge has the possibility of altering or collapsing the system that appears to have worked extremely well in the past.",,,,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/15683",,"en","English",,"University of Canterbury",,,,,"http://library.canterbury.ac.nz/thesis/etheses_copyright.shtml",,"All Rights Reserved",,,,,,,,,,,"The legal implications of bioprospecting in the Antarctic region",,,"Electronic Thesis or Dissertation",,,"Law",,"University of Canterbury",,"Masters",,,"Master of Laws",,,,,"College of Business and Law, University of Canterbury",,,"michelle.finnemore@canterbury.ac.nz",,,,,,,,
"19380","10092/839","Duncan, John William",,,,,,,"2018",,"This thesis looks at iconic branding in the context of fast moving consumer goods (FMCG) in
New Zealand. Iconic branding has been studied in a broad overall context but has not yet
been considered for individual brand types. Although iconic branding literature covers a
variety of brand types, it does not go into specifics on if, and how, each iconic brand type
differs. This thesis studies the development of iconic brands in the context of FMCG and
presents the process as a strategy option for FMCG brands. Currently there is no iconic
branding literature that discusses these types of brands in a private or national brand context.
Likewise, in FMCG literature discussing private and national brands there is no mention of
iconic brands as either a concept or a strategy. As there is no overlap between the two
literature streams this thesis breaks ground by integrating the concepts. Specifically, this
research looks at iconic FMCG brands to find out how they are formed, how they differ from
non-iconic FMCG brands, how consumers perceive them, and how brand managers can
develop them. Data has been gathered with focus groups where consumers discussed their
perceptions of iconic and non-iconic private and national FMCG brands. The use of
projective focus group techniques allowed the researcher to uncover perceptions that
consumers may not have expressed through traditional question and answer methods.
Thematic analysis was then used to analyse the data and interpret themes. The findings
revealed that iconic FMCG brands differ to non-iconic FMCG brands in three key ways.
Iconic FMCG brands were found to have attachments with consumers, while displaying
aspects of New Zealand cultural heritage, and greater visibility. This study presents iconic
FMCG brands as a new sub-topic of study in iconic branding literature for future studies to
explore further. This thesis contributes to FMCG literature by proposing iconic branding as a
new strategy for both private and national brands. In addition, the benefits of this strategy that apply to private brands and how they can be used to combat any perceived gap between
private and national brands is discussed.",,,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/15680",,,"en","English",,"University of Canterbury",,,,,"http://library.canterbury.ac.nz/thesis/etheses_copyright.shtml",,"All Rights Reserved",,,,,,,,,,,"Iconic branding as a strategy for private and national fast moving consumer good brands",,,"Electronic Thesis or Dissertation",,,,,"University of Canterbury",,"Masters",,,"Master of Commerce",,,,,"College of Business and Law, University of Canterbury",,,"John.william.duncan@gmail.com",,,,,,,,"Dr Ann-Marie Kennedy"
"17729","10092/839","Drain, Quentin Paul",,,,,,,"2001",,"This thesis presents an empirical investigation of age-related differences in children's processing of advertising and subsequent persuasion. Limitations of paradigms used in past research on children's responses to advertising are identified: of particular concern is the rather cursory attention that has been given to involvement. This thesis investigates the potential for the Elaboration Likelihood Model (ELM) to provide a more sophisticated perspective of children's processing of advertising and resultant persuasion. Thus, both children's abilities and motivations to process advertising are given much-needed attention. Hypotheses are grounded in theories of children's information processing abilities that provide descriptions of expected age-related differences in children's processing of advertising.


An experimental design for assessing age-related differences in children's processing of advertising and resultant persuasion is presented. The implemented design was a 2 x 2 x 2 factorial experiment manipulating involvement with the ad (high/low) and assistance (assisted/not assisted) for children from two age groups (7-11 and 11-16) that have associated information processing abilities. Triangulation of measures, including thoughts produced during viewing, argument recognition, and formation of Attitude toward the Ad (Aad), Attitude toward the Brand (Ab), and Purchase Intention (PI), provide a holistic view of children's processing and persuasion. Thought and argument recognition analyses revealed mechanisms producing persuasion. Path analyses, using evaluations of central message arguments and peripheral cues as predictors of Aad, Ab, and PI, allowed persuasion to be specified as taken through the central or the peripheral routes.


207 children from a single full-primary school participated in the experiment. The results reveal that even children as young as 8 years of age have the ability to take the central route to persuasion. In fact, whilst the older children exhibited greater ability to elaborate central message arguments and thereby greater potential ability to take the central route, the younger children exhibited an equivalent and in some cases superior tendency to form attitudes via the central route to persuasion. Implications for theory, management and public policy are discussed.

by businesses and home users, while public WLANs have been established in areas
expected to have high demand for bandwidth, such as cafes, airports, and hotels.
Existing solutions for such WLAN access networks have been exposed to security
vulnerabilities. Although researchers have proposed improved security for WLANs,

This study investigated the performance and security issues of IEEE 802.11 wireless

the IEEE 802.1X and Virtual Private Network (VPN). Our results showed that
different security mechanisms degraded WLAN performance in different ways.
Network performance degradation increased as the protection of the security
mechanisms increased. Furthermore, the VPN model impacted the performance more
than the 802.1X model. The performance degradation calculated was incorporated

The stock of an individual’s health increases as income rises as well as investment in health augmenting consumption. The increasing attention paid to the health-income nexus motivates this thesis to use macroeconomic theory, tools and methods to examine the link. This study first replicates a highly cited empirical work by Hartwig (2008) on Baumol’s Cost Disease (BCD) to explain the rising trends of healthcare expenditure. The gaps identified during the replication prompt the designing of testable theoretical models of BCD in Chapter 3. The formulated BCD hypotheses are tested using two sets of panel data estimators that assume slope homogeneity and heterogeneity. In Chapter 4, a Monte Carlo simulation experiment is conducted to investigate the performance of recently developed “mean group type” panel estimators that are robust to cross-sectional dependence, slope heterogeneity, non-stationarity and endogeneity. The simulation experiment results inform the choice of the panel estimators used to examine the income elasticity of healthcare expenditure for selected African countries in Chapter 5. Overall, I find that Hartwig’s (2008) study suffers from methodological flaws and the tested hypotheses revealno significant relationship to support the BCD predictions using an OECD dataset. From the simulation experiments, I find the Common Correlated Effect Mean Group (CCEMG) estimator to be the “best” on the dimensions of bias, efficiency, and coverage rates. Lastly, the empirical analysis using the dataset for 47 African countries and estimating with CCEMG provides no significant outcomes to support whether total, public and private health expenditures are either income inelastic or elastic i.e., health care is a necessity or luxury good.

"17791","10092/839","Hartill, Kristie Louise",,,,,,,"2000",,"This thesis considers the effect of the increasingly dynamic and competitive business environment on employment negotiations. International trends in collective bargaining have resulted in unions and employers negotiating employment contracts in a context that has become progressively hostile to the union institution. However, the hostile nature of management-union interactions has not precluded negotiations from progressing to impasse in the form of an industrial dispute. It does however, render the phenomena of protracted industrial disputes anomalous in contemporary employment relations. The purpose of this research is to investigate the applicability and relevance of extant collective bargaining and negotiations theory to the experience of an industrial dispute. It is propounded that most of the literature pertaining to negotiations is based on brief, or normal periods of negotiations. Thus, the research questions guiding this study engender the extrapolation of the literature to an extended dispute. To this end, Walton, Cutcher-Gershenfeld and McKersie's (1994) model of strategic negotiations has been applied to the dynamics of the New Zealand Fire Service industrial dispute. This was achieved through the qualitative analysis of the Fire Service in a case study design. The primary sources of data were documents and archive records, and interviews with key informants. The analysis of this dispute proffered the conclusion that existing negotiations theory is valuable in explaining the dynamics of a prolonged industrial dispute in the complexities of contemporary employment relations. Furthermore, propositions from the theory enabled a consideration of the relationship between strategic choice and dispute duration, providing pertinent implications for industrial relations policy and practice.",,,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/14472",,,"en","English",,"University of Canterbury",,,,,"http://library.canterbury.ac.nz/thesis/etheses_copyright.shtml",,"All Rights Reserved",,,,,,,,,,,"The dynamics of strategic negotiations : a case study of the New Zealand Fire Service industrial dispute",,,"Electronic Thesis or Dissertation",,,"Business Administration",,"University of Canterbury",,"Masters",,,"Master of Commerce",,,"751154",,"College of Business and Law, University of Canterbury",,,"ucresearchrepository@canterbury.ac.nz",,,,,,,,"Dr. Ian Brooks"

"19440","10092/839","Fang, Shupin",,,,,,,"2018",,"Two minutes after midnight on 14 November 2016, a magnitude 7.8 (Mw) earthquake struck
the town of Kaikoura, New Zealand. The earthquake resulted in two deaths, over $900
million in insurance claims, significant damage to infrastructure such as roads and buildings,
and resulted in stressful situations for local businesses and the community. Kaikoura is well
known for its tourism resources, as a quarter of the jobs in the Kaikoura District are in the
tourism sector. Tourist arrivals decreased dramatically because of the earthquake, and local
tourism SMEs lost substantial customers, if not all, and this negatively impacted on their
revenue. Organisational resilience has emerged as a significant issue in the post-disaster
literature, and this study attempts to understand how tourism small and medium-sized
enterprises (SMEs) can develop organisational resilience to cope with unexpected changes, as
well as incremental changes, as part of business as usual. Given that most of the local tourism
SMEs in Kaikoura are family-owned and small in size, the role of the owners and managers
has become essentially important in these businesses to build organisational resilience. Thus,
this study aims at incorporating psychological capital into the study of organisational
resilience. The study investigated how the psychological capital of business owners/managers
could influence the organisational resilience of tourism SMEs in post-disaster Kaikoura.

In doing so, this study was grounded in an interpretivist research paradigm, and adopted a
narrative analysis approach to understand the influence of psychological capital on
organisational resilience. The owners and managers of 17 local tourism SMEs took part in indepth
interviews. As part of an interpretivist paradigm and based on the requirements of
narrative analysis, the researcher analysed and interpreted the social reality of local
businesses in Kaikoura and configured one general narrative story, as well as three individual
narrative stories that complement the initial thematic analysis that was used to analyse the
data. The patterns and relationships within the data in relation to the components of
psychological capital and their influence on organisational resilience were embedded in the
general narrative story, explaining the main similarities and differences among the 17 tourism
SMEs. The three individual narrative stories were configured based on the data of the three
most representative participants, highlighting the most important and interesting findings in
relation to the research questions. Through this study, the researcher has identified that in general the positive psychological capital of the participants enhanced organisational
resilience during the post-disaster recovery. Different psychological capital components,
namely, self-efficacy, hope, optimism and psychological resilience, have enhanced different
aspects of the organisational resilience of the SMEs. In addition, the researcher also found
that the adaptive resilience of the tourism SMEs was more often enhanced by the
psychological capital of the participants as opposed to planned resilience. Moreover, this
study found that it was through different coping mechanisms used by the participants after
the earthquake that psychological capital had a positive influence on organisational resilience.
Last but not least, this study identified that a lack of support from the government and other
local businesses seemed to have weakened the psychological capital of some
owners/managers of new businesses, in particular, which might have become an obstacle in
the recovery of the community post-disaster.

This study contributes to the literature by suggesting that psychological capital of business
owners/managers can have an influence on organisational resilience. Except for a few studies
that have examined social capital and community resilience, the relationship between
psychological capital and organisational resilience within a post-disaster context has not been
examined before. This study shows also that SMEs generally lack planned resilience, and
provids practical recommendations for enhancing planned resilience in such businesses. From
a methodological perspective, this study reinforces the value of employing narrative analysis
to understand the experiences of entrepreneurs, owners and managers in the tourism sector. In
addition, this study emphasises and exemplifies the importance of conducting narrative
analysis in an “authentic” way, which is often neglected by the tourism scholars. The
authenticity of the narrative analysis in this study was reached by carefully addressing each
requirement and demonstrating each characteristic of narrative analysis, and then presenting
those requirements and characteristics in the general narrative story.",,,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/15697",,,"en","English",,"University of Canterbury",,,,,"http://library.canterbury.ac.nz/thesis/etheses_copyright.shtml",,"All Rights Reserved",,,,,,,,,,,"Post-disaster psychological capital and organisational resilience : a narrative analysis of small business owners’/managers’ experiences.",,,"Electronic Thesis or Dissertation",,,"Business Administration",,"University of Canterbury",,"Masters",,,"Master of Commerce",,,,,"College of Business and Law, University of Canterbury",,,"echo.fang@pg.canterbury.ac.nz",,,,,,,,"Girish Prayag"
"16741","10092/839","Alinaghi, Nazila",,,,,,,"2017",,"This thesis consists of three essays linked together by the methodology of meta-regression analysis. The first two essays address a long standing question of interest to both economists and policymakers which is whether taxes exert an important influence on economic growth and, if they do, how large this effect might be. To answer this question, I study two different setups. The first involves OECD countries and the second studies U.S. states. The last essay studies the performance of the FAT-PET-PEESE (FPP) procedure, a commonly employed approach for addressing publication selection bias in meta-regression analysis studies in economics and business.

In my first meta-regression analysis, I combine results from 42 studies containing 713 comparable estimates, all which endeavour to estimate the effect of taxes on economic growth in OECD countries (Chapter 2). I then switch from an institutionally and culturally diverse setup to a setup in which there is a set of common institutional features, U.S. states. I integrate 966 estimates derived from 29 studies investigating the effect of taxes on economic growth in the U.S. states (Chapter 3). The objective of these two studies is to answer the following questions: (Q1) What is the overall, mean effect of taxes on economic growth?; (Q2) Are some taxes (e.g., personal income taxes) more distortionary than others (e.g., value added taxes)?; (Q3) Is there any empirical evidence to support the conventional wisdom that “distortionary taxes” used to fund “unproductive expenditures” are especially harmful for economic growth?; and (Q4) What are the factors causing researchers to encounter different or even contradictory results? My results for OECD countries suggest that there is publication bias towards negative estimates. Controlling for publication bias, I find that the overall effect of taxes on economic growth is statistically insignificant and negligibly small. An increase in unproductive expenditure funded by distortionary taxes has a significant negative effect on growth. I find weak evidence to support the idea that some taxes are more distortionary than others. Lastly, several factors are present that can explain discrepancies among the reported estimates, such as estimation methods, types of standard errors, whether the original study was published in a peer-reviewed journal, the publication date, and so on. I find the following outcomes in the study of taxes in U.S. states: estimates in the literature are characterized by statistically significant negative publication bias. Once I control for publication bias, the overall effect is not particularly meaningful since it lumps together different kinds of tax policies. With respect to particular types of taxes, I could not find enough evidence to support that taxes on labour are more growth retarding than other types of taxes. Evidence regarding other types of taxes is mixed. Finally, as with results for OECD countries, there are several factors that appear to explain discrepancies among the reported estimates for U.S. states.

In the Chapter 4, I conduct a Monte Carlo analysis to evaluate the performance of the FPP procedure in detecting and correcting for publication bias. The main three objectives of applying FPP procedure are: (i) Funnel Asymmetry Testing (FAT) to test whether the sample of estimates is influenced by publication selection bias; (ii) Precision Effect Testing (PET) to test whether there is a genuine non-zero true effect of estimates once the publication bias is accommodated and corrected; and (iii) Precision Effect Estimate with Standard Error (PEESE) to obtain an improved estimate of the overall mean effect. I simulate two common types of publication bias. These are publication bias against insignificant results and publication bias against wrong-signed results (according to associated theory). I run these simulations in three different environments, Fixed Effects, Random Effects, and Panel Random Effects. My findings indicate that the FPP procedure performs well in the basic but unrealistic environment of “Fixed Effects”, when there is one true effect and sampling error is the only reason why studies produce different estimates. However, once I study its performance in more realistic data environments, where there is heterogeneity in the population effects between and within studies, the FPP procedure becomes unreliable for the first two objectives, and is less efficient than other estimators when estimating overall mean effects. Further, hypothesis tests about the overall, mean effect cannot be trusted. These results call into question the efficacy of using the FPP procedure to test and correct for publication selection bias in meta-regression analysis studies.",,,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/13741",,,"en","English",,"University of Canterbury",,,,,"http://library.canterbury.ac.nz/thesis/etheses_copyright.shtml",,"All Rights Reserved",,,,,,,,,,,"Essays on meta-regression analysis : two empirical studies on tax and economic growth and a simulation.",,,"Electronic Thesis or Dissertation",,,"Economics",,"University of Canterbury",,"Doctoral",,,"Doctor of Philosophy",,,,,"College of Business and Law, University of Canterbury",,,"Nazila_alinaghi2000@yahoo.com",,,,,,,,"Professor Bob Reed"

Their effect is also concerning with the average economic impact increasing more than tenfold over the last few decades from US$14 billion in 1976-1985 to US$140 billion in 2005-2014, and the number of persons affected rising from 60 million to over 170 million for the same periods (GFDRR, 2016). This highlights the significant role of contemporary emergency management in order to minimize the potential damage and impact on human lives. A Personalised Mobile Emergency Alert Service (PMEAS) is one of the endeavours that have been adopted by many developed countries. It provides prompt emergency alerts via mobile devices based on user’s current location and personal profile. PMEAS has succeeded in saving lives and properties in many cases (http://www.nws.noaa.gov).

However, similar to the other personalised online services that require users to register or disclose personal information in exchange for a service that is tailored to their needs, the users of PMEAS are also expected to disclose personal information to receive customized notifications. Thus, users would be exposed to the potential risks that raise privacy concerns. This study examines the factors that influence an individual to disclose personal information in order to use PMEAS. Since user’s information disclosure is vital for a PMEAS to be successful, the results of this study would also facilitate the understanding of the motivators and inhibitors of information disclosure in PMEAS.

This paper reports on an empirical study that investigates individual’s willingness to disclose personal information in order to use PMEAS, focusing on mobile users in New Zealand. Protection Motivation Theory (PMT) is used as a theoretical framework supported by the trade-off between personalisation and privacy concern. The results suggest that applying PMT is useful for explaining an individual’s willingness to disclose personal information to use a PMEAS. By improving the understanding of users’ expectations and concerns, the research outcomes provide insights to the government agencies and PMEAS providers to design and implement better services and to perform better risk management.",,,,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/13800",,"en","English",,"University of Canterbury",,,,,"http://library.canterbury.ac.nz/thesis/etheses_copyright.shtml",,"All Rights Reserved",,,,,,,,,,,"Emergency notification on mobile devices : a trade-off between protection motivation, privacy concern and personalised notification.",,,"Electronic Thesis or Dissertation",,,"Economics",,"University of Canterbury",,"Masters",,,"Master of Commerce",,"2501460",,,"College of Business and Law, University of Canterbury",,,"Hayami.zj@gmail.com",,,,,,,,"A/Professor Annette Mills"

First, an extensive literature review is undertaken to identify definitions of innovation. A number of hypotheses are then proposed based on the international literature. Secondly, supported by the New Zealand Manufactures and Exporters Association (NZMEA), a unique dataset was collected via an Internet-based instrument, the Innovation Survey of the Manufacturing Sector. A series of regression models were then used to test the proposed hypotheses. The final part of the research involved a number of in-depth company interviews that approached the topic from a different perspective and complemented the qualitative analyses by further investigating issues that were unresolved from the survey.

A multiple case study methodology was used to examine the growth paths of eight SMEs over a period of fourteen years. Four firms represented manufacturing and four, the professional and business services industry. The firms were paired according to similar sectors and contrasting growth paths. Longitudinal employment data illustrated the firms’ growth paths, and the primary method of data collection was semi-structured interviews of the firms’ owner-managers. The research incorporated extensive literature, including traditional research approaches and life cycle models and emergent literature on organisational learning and growth paths. 
The growth and non-growth firms were found to be distinct from each other, regardless of industry. The growth firms’ owner-managers had strong growth ambitions and actively sought the recognition and challenges that arise from the operation of multiple growth businesses. The non-growth owner-managers had passive growth ambitions and focused on maintaining their accustomed lifestyle. These differences were also illustrated in the firms’ approaches to networking, internationalisation and technological advancement. The growth firm owner-managers were all portfolio entrepreneurs and had strong professional networks, which they considered were strategically vital. In contrast, the non-growth owner-managers were novice entrepreneurs and were nonchalant towards networking. Innovation and flexibility were identified as important characteristics in the long-term performance of the firms. Findings also indicated that owner-managers’ perceptions of their external business environment determined the influence it had on the business. Individual and collective learning processes underpin these findings in determining long-term growth performance of the firms. The strong interrelationships between owner-managers, learning processes, and longitudinal growth paths suggest areas of future research.",,,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/2363",,,"en",,,"University of Canterbury.

"2589","10092/839","Gunaratne, Kodicara Asoka",,,,,,,"2008",,"The objective of this thesis is to determine whether it is possible to improve the adequacy of support to “post start-up” small businesses in Sri Lanka by making changes to the current support regime to encourage their growth. The interest in this issue stems from (a) previous research carried out which highlights the substantially lower contribution to employment growth from the small businesses in Sri Lanka as compared to what is observed in other countries, and (b) the increasing emphasis upon stimulating the small business sector to make a significant contribution to the national economy which is apparent in recent policy proposals in the White Paper presented by the Task Force for Small and Medium Enterprise (SME) development.

An examination of extant literature suggests that the understanding of the factors that influence the growth of post start-up small businesses in developing countries is limited. Knowledge is also limited on the type of support that is required to adequately address such factors. To systematically investigate the existing knowledge gaps in these areas a questionnaire survey was conducted. In-depth interviews were also carried out with small business owner-managers and key employees of organisations providing small business support.

A variety of statistical techniques were employed to analyse the responses to the questionnaire survey. Overall the results indicate that the factors influencing the growth of post start-up small businesses are highly individual in nature. Results of the study also indicate that the employment growth in post start-up small businesses is very limited. Drawing on the results of the research a conceptual model is proposed that suggests a holistic approach to the identification, evaluation and delivery of support to address the factors constraining the growth of post start-up small businesses.",,,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/2229",,,"en",,,"University of Canterbury.

"9454","10092/839","Li, Qi",,,,,,,"2013",,"This study primarily investigates the determinants of CEO membership of New Zealand (NZ) boards, and the effect of CEO board membership on firm performance, for publicly-listed NZ firms between 1997 to 2008. The project is conducted using a unique hand-collected panel dataset containing information about CEO participation on the board, firm characteristics, firm performance, ownership, and firm governance. The sample covers the twelve-year period.


The sample statistics of CEO board membership reveal that on average, approximately 30% of NZ CEOs do not sit on their company board. In addition, the number (percentage) of incidences of CEOs off their company board has been increasing. Specifically, the percentage of CEOs off the board was approximately 20% in 1997 but 42% in 2008.


Models examining the determinants of CEO board participation indicate that the probability of CEO board membership is significantly related to the opacity of firms' information environment and the strength of firms' governance environment. Specifically, the probability of CEO board membership is significantly affected by firm size, firm age, percentage of independent directors, board ownership, and multiple directorships in independent companies. In particular, firm size and percentage of independent directors on the board possess economic significance. The negative association between the probability of CEO board membership and the strength of firms' governance environment is consistent with CEO utility maximization. 


I also find that although CEO board membership is positively related to ROA, ROE and Jensen's alpha in basic regression models, the positive effect observed in accounting performance models disappears after controlling for self-selection. In other words, firms with better accounting firm performance tend to appoint their CEOs on the board. This may attribute to  the possibility that CEO board membership is  optimally determined by shareholders. The evidence from  a market-based model also reflects shareholder interests  after controlling for the negative self-selection behavior. 


As an additional analysis, I examine the determinants of different degrees of CEO board involvement where CEOs on the board are categorized into CEO-director and CEO duality (the CEO also holds the position of the chairman of the board). This analysis shows that a number of explanatory variables have a non-linear relationship with the degree of CEO board involvement. For example, CEO board involvement is negatively related to firm age and multiple directorships in independent companies but positively related to their squared terms. To the contrary, CEO board involvement is positively related to Tobin's Q ratio and percentage of independent directors but negatively related to their squared terms.


Moreover, basic regression results examining the effect of the extent of CEO board involvement on firm performance reveal that dual firms and CEO-off-the-board firms are associated with lower accounting firm performance than CEO-director firms, but dual firms are associated with better Jensen's alpha and CEO-off-the-board firms are associated with lower Jensen's alpha. The robustness analysis finds that the negative effect of CEO duality on operating performance is significantly mitigated by  self-selection and the effect of CEOs off the board on operating performance is intensified by self-selection. In other words, after taking into account the self-selection bias, CEO duality status provides strong evidence for CEO utility maximization whereas CEOs off the board are optimally chosen given the underlying characteristics. However, the results from the market-based models show the exact opposite story after controlling for the self-selection bias: CEO duality is optimally chosen whereas the costs of CEOs off the board are greater than their benefits in firms with CEOs off the board, providing evidence for  CEO utility maximization.",,,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/8685",,,"en",,,"University of Canterbury.

This thesis explores the application and evaluation of Appreciative Inquiry (AI) in the unique context of New Zealand through the perspectives of facilitators of AI. I conducted semi-structured, in-depth interviews with nine experienced AI facilitators in order to understand their perspectives on how AI works, under which circumstances it is most effective and how they evaluate AI.
Facilitators tend to come from backgrounds that embrace humanistic values, a premise shared by AI. Participants in this study regard the underlying principles of AI as central, whereas they consider concrete processes, such as the 4D-cycle, to be useful but not essential. Facilitators are very concerned about the appropriate use of AI and clearly identified circumstances supportive or detrimental to AI processes. For example, AI may be inappropriate in situations where there is a pre-determined agenda or leadership is very autocratic. Facilitators are also concerned that AI as a methodology should be applied more wholesomely, acknowledging and working through negative emotions rather than suppressing them.
Facilitators face a paradox: They embrace values that put the individual centre stage and regard people as human beings rather than human resources. At the same time, they are external service providers to clients who are at times more concerned with quick fixes, and do not want to invest the time necessary to engage in deep reflection on values and transformative change.
Findings suggest that we need to reconsider our interpretation of AI towards embracing the underlying humanistic values more, rather than focusing on the concrete applications (e.g. 4D-cycle). The paradox between embracing humanistic values inherent in AI and bottom-line orientation in most organisations warrants further research.",,,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/2608",,,"en",,,"University of Canterbury.

"2979","10092/839","Walker, Bernard L",,,,,,,"2009",,"The existing grievance literature has tended to focus on employee decisions concerning dispute action in light of Hirschman’s (1970) ‘loyalty voice exit’ (LVE) model. The present research sought to take an alternative approach by exploring the processes associated with grievances and disputes, through following a series of cases covering both employer and employee perspectives of the same dispute. The cases involved individual-level disputes where the parties were still in an ongoing employment relationship at the time that they accessed the mediation services of the government employment agency. The research process involved observing the mediation sessions and then conducting follow-up interviews with all the individuals associated with each case, including the employer and employee, along with union advocates, legal representatives, and mediators resulting in a total of 70 interviews. The findings covered a range of areas which combined to form a new model which reframed the dispute process as a series of choices, events and stages, rather than the single-choice perspective of much existing literature.

The model centres upon three core constructs.  The first of these is the Dispute Type, which refers to the nature or substance of the dispute, and identifies three distinct types each of which have their own dynamics and progression, with a significant predetermining effect on the course of employment disputes.  The second construct, Power, concerns the relative power of the parties, with a party’s overall power comprising of individual, organisational, and external levels. The series of dispute actions were also found to be driven by power-related dynamics, and this produces a model that both builds upon and also extends, existing models of power in the negotiation literature (Lawler, 1992; Kim et al., 2005). Finally the third construct, Interaction Type, draws on Pruitt and Kim’s (2004) dual concern model, to explore the combined interaction of the strategies and tactics utilised by each side in a dispute sequence. Extending this model into employment dispute situations, the research identifies dynamics which can lead to major escalation of disputes, precluding opportunities for resolution. 

The research has significant implications for organisations in their management of individual-level employee disputes, as well as for parties such unions and other representatives who are reframed as agents with the potential to increase or reduce the power of parties.",,,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/4388",,,"en",,,"University of Canterbury.

Examination of the partnership begins with the creation of the Science and Technological Cooperation (STC) Arrangement in 1991 and comes to a close in 2008, following the Arrangement’s ‘upgrade’ to an STC Agreement on 16 July. During this time, the intensification of the EU’s activities in RS&T is evident. The Seventh Framework Programme (FP7) currently constitutes the most internationalised Programme to date. Identifying the complementary nature of New Zealand and EU research priorities thus suggests that now, more than ever, the New Zealand research community stands to gain from participation within such an inclusive venture. 

Aiming to assess the current status of New Zealand-EU research collaboration, the research identifies a number of recurring themes, both positive and negative, that influence the nature of the RS&T relationship. These themes focus on problems concerning visibility within the EU, geographical isolation from this important market, an absence of targeted domestic funding for New Zealand-EU RS&T collaboration and the unwieldy bureaucratic process of the Framework Programme. The research also determines the importance of both ‘official’ and ‘informal’ mechanisms’ in combating the outlined collaborative bottlenecks. Taking these themes into account, the thesis ultimately looks to provide recommendations concerning the future of New Zealand-EU engagement in this field.",,,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/2697",,,"en",,,"University of Canterbury.

The complexity of the supply chain has increased due to various levels of raw material sourcing, uncertain market conditions, competition and ever changing customer demands. The aim of this literature-based study is to investigate how the literature suggests supply chain risks are approached in a dairy industry and the methods that have been found to mitigate or ameliorate negative impacts of events that compromise supply chain performance and reputation of firm. A conceptual framework for supply chain risk management is discussed for better handling of risks in a dairy supply chain. The main focus of the study will be on how supply chain risk management is approached in the literature, what are the various kinds of supply chain risks in a dairy industry, perception of supply chain risks in a dairy firms and its effects on the proper functioning of the firm, the role of trust, communication and relationship between supply chain partners as the main parameters for better handling of risks in a dairy supply chain. Importance is also given to understand what the existing literature suggests on ways to mitigate and ameliorate negative effects of risks for better supply chain performance and reputation of firm. These are some of the questions on which the research is built. 

Comprehensive literature review along with case study analysis has been used as the main approach for data collection. A three stage research approach was used to answer the research questions. Stage one was focusing on the existing literature on supply chain risk management. Four cases (stage two) on supply chain failures in dairy firms are used to analyse the supply chain risks and how it could be managed well by the organization for a better performance and reputation of the firm. Finally, a matrix (stage three) is developed from the input received from the cases which is linked to the literature review on supply chain risk management and also explains how these risks can be ameliorated for a greater supply chain performance. Risk and uncertainties can obstruct the smooth flow of supply chain activities which has an effect on its performance. Proper identification and assessment of risk is of major importance in a proper supply chain risk management. Supply chain risk management is built on the foundation of trust, commitment, frequent information sharing and a perfect relationship.

"18137","10092/839",,"Amore, Alberto",,,,,,"2017",,"Research in the governance of urban tourist spaces is characterized by a lack of argumentative inquiry and scant use of critical theory. This is evident, particularly, in the study of tourism and post-disaster urban recovery, with very few contributions assessing the phenomenon from a social theory perspective. This thesis examines the complex phenomenon of planning and governance for urban tourism spaces in contexts facing physical recovery from natural disasters. It does so by looking at the governance dynamics and the mechanism of decision-
making put in place before and after triggering events like earthquakes and tsunamis. 

This thesis provides evidence from Christchurch, New Zealand, by focusing on the policies and strategies for the regeneration of the city centre put in place before and after the disruptive earthquakes of 2010 and 2011. The thesis looks at power relations, structures and ideologies through a Lukesian appraisal of pre-and-post disaster governance from two relevant urban tourist spaces located in the Christchurch central city area: the Arts Centre of Christchurch and the Town Hall and Performing Arts Precinct. The research strategy adopted for the study combined archival research, interviews with key stakeholders and fieldwork notes over a period of two years. The research deployed a comparative case study methodology that focuses on projects taking place within a spatially defined area of the city centre where special legislation was enacted as result of the earthquakes.

The findings from the interviews and their triangulation with documents retrieved from national and local authorities suggest that the earthquakes affected the engagement among stakeholders and the mechanisms of decision-making. Also, the findings show patterns of disaster capitalism in post-earthquake governance for urban tourist spaces in the Christchurch CBD, with episodes of exclusion, lobbying and amendment of rules and legislation that directly benefited the interests of a narrow group of privileged stakeholders. Overall, the study shows that the earthquakes of 2010 and 2011 accelerated neoliberal practices of site development in Christchurch, with the seismic events used as a pretext to implement market-oriented site projects in the CBD area.",,,,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/14558",,"en","English",,"University of Canterbury",,,,,"http://library.canterbury.ac.nz/thesis/etheses_copyright.shtml",,"All Rights Reserved",,,,,,,,,,,"Before/after : the governance of urban tourist spaces in the context of the Christchurch CBD recovery",,,"Electronic Thesis or Dissertation",,,"Business Administration",,"University of Canterbury",,"Doctoral",,,"Doctor of Philosophy",,,"2541044",,"College of Business and Law, University of Canterbury",,,"alberto.pereira.amore@gmail.com",,,,,,,,"Prof. C.

"18187","10092/839",,"Waddell, Harry",,,,,,"2017",,"This research explores look-through companies (LTCs) from the perspective of tax
practitioners. Specifically, LTCs are compared with their predecessor, loss-attributing
qualifying companies (LAQCs), in order to evaluate the efficacy of New Zealand’s closely
held company regimes. Whilst Parliament may have had the intention of reducing compliance
costs with amendments and changes to closely held company legislation (such as introducing
LTCs), empirical evidence suggests that the opposite has occurred. Interviews with tax
practitioners were used to gather evidence and thus draw conclusions on the overall
effectiveness of the LTC regime. As well as this, documentary analysis was used to
understand the policy rationale in enacting closely held company legislation. Findings were
interpreted using a branch of institutional theory, historical institutionalism.

The findings indicated that a range of businesses use the LTC regime. Practitioners did not
have a consensus on what the typical use of LTCs may look like, but indicated that LTCs
were used for rental properties, companies anticipating losses, small family businesses and
for international tax structuring and planning. Whilst Inland Revenue and Parliament
contemplated the use of the LTC regime for small family businesses in enacting the regime,
the other uses were not expected. In fact, most of the other uses are directly in conflict with
the rationale for the regime: eliminating the role tax played in choice of entity, achieving
closer integration between the company and its shareholders, and reducing complexity.

Based on their experience, practitioners were generally of the view that the LTC regime
resulted in higher compliance costs, especially when compared to QC/LAQCs. Additionally,
practitioners were also of the view that the LTC regime resulted in higher compliance costs
when compared to traditional structures such as sole traders, partnerships and companies.
These higher compliance costs arise due to LTCs being more complex than these other
structures. Practitioners stated that this complexity was due to two reasons: the loss/deduction
limitation rule (and owners-basis test) and poorly drafted legislation.

As previously mentioned, reducing complexity was an original aim of special closely held
company regimes. However, when considering these findings, it appears the opposite has
occurred. This complexity was one of the reasons that practitioners did not generally recommend the LTC regime to clients. However, if clients did use the LTC regime, it was
almost always at the recommendation of practitioners. Clients tended to have very low levels
of knowledge, and often knew more about LAQCs, which have been repealed for a number
of years. Figures released under the Official Information Act indicated that LTCs have not
been as popular as their predecessor, LAQCs. In the last year that LAQCs were in existence,
there were 152,000 tax returns filed. This compares to 45,883 LTC returns being filed in
2016.

In regard to the rationale or motivation behind using LTCs, there was no consensus amongst
practitioners. The most common reason for using the structure was the fiscal transparency
that the structure provides. Some practitioners also viewed limited liability as being a reason
for use. Other reasons for use included minimising double taxation, tax-free distributions to
shareholders, and minimising tax on historic retained earnings. Another important reason for
their use mentioned by practitioners was that LTCs were seen as a default replacement for
LAQC/QCs and as such, many owners choose to transition into the LTC regime. However,
this is also contrary to the policy rationale for the regime, reducing the role that taxation plays
in the choice of entity structure.

Finally, practitioners were generally of the view that the most recent round of changes would
decrease compliance costs for those that used the LTC regime. All practitioners were
supportive of the removal of the loss/deduction rule, which, as previously mentioned, is a
leading contributor to the regime’s complexity. However, a number of practitioners believed
that other changes should have been made to the regime. These included expanding the five
counted-owners restriction, and clarifying the transparency of the LTC regime.",,,,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/14590",,"en","English",,"University of Canterbury",,,,,"http://library.canterbury.ac.nz/thesis/etheses_copyright.shtml",,"All Rights Reserved",,,,,,,,,,,"New Zealand’s look-through company regime: a tax practitioners’ perspective",,,"Electronic Thesis or Dissertation",,"Accountancy",,,"University of Canterbury",,"Masters",,,"Master of Commerce",,"2541181",,,"College of Business and Law, University of Canterbury",,,"harry.waddell@live.com",,,,,,,,"Professor Adrian Sawyer"

Environmental conditions and a firm's strategic orientation are also considered. Given the prevalence of cooperation, the thesis also investigates why many firms do not collaborate. The results of the moderated regression analysis indicate that there are no performance differences, across any of the performance measures used in the study, between firms involved in collaborative activity and firms that choose to remain independent. There is, however, some evidence suggesting that collaborating firms have higher performance levels than firms that would like to collaborate, but are unable to do so. The results also suggest that a firm's strategic orientation influences performance; customer- and technological-orientation both exhibit a positive association with firm performance.

then superimposed onto the FX carry trade. Although ’naive’ returns to the FX carry trade, as 
documented elsewhere in the literature are strongly positive, allowing for stop-loss rules 
results in returns that are insignificantly different from zero. The ability to cash in on the much 
vaunted forward premium puzzle relies on being able to stay in the trade, which seems strongly at 
odds with industry risk management policies. The stop loss signals generated are modelled using 
available currency futures data and client segmentation categories, but fails to establish a 
meaningful relationship. Chapter III extends the already established link between the returns to 
the FX carry trade and historical volatility measures to that of the entire FX option implied

"4866","10092/839",,,"McCahon, Oliver Colin",,,,,"2000",,"Although many Mathematical Programming techniques have been developed for application to decision making under uncertainty, these techniques are based on three implicit assumptions. The first is that probabilities can be determined for the outcomes of the uncertain parameters, the second is that the decision maker is risk neutral, and the third is that all of the decision maker's concerns can be included in the formulation. While there are many decision making situations for which these assumptions are appropriate, there are many other situations for which they are not. In particular, these assumptions are seldom supportable for strategic decision making problems. Strategic decision making must consider possible future events that have seldom, if ever, occurred before, and for which probabilities cannot be determined. Because the situation will occur only once, and the decision will have a large impact, the decision ma.ker is unlikely to be risk neutral. Finally, the decision makers will often have concerns that cannot be represented in a mathematical programming formulation.
 
 In this work we present an approach to decision making under uncertainty that relaxes the three assumptions listed above. We assume that the uncertain future can be described as a small set of scenarios. These scenarios can be considered to have separate, competing objectives, because decisions that prepare well for one scenario generally prepare poorly for the others. The problem is formulated as a multi-objective optimisation problem, and a set of non-dominated decisions is found. The decision maker can choose a decision from this set according to his/her attitudes to risk, and to account for other requirements that cannot be represented in a mathematical programming formulation. This approach is developed for problems with continuous variables, and then extended to problems that include binary variables.",,,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/4369",,,"en",,,"University of Canterbury.

"6940","10092/839","Ainsworth, Jeremy",,,,,,,"2011",,"The main objective of this study was to determine the consequences of making changes to retail web-sites by examining how consumers respond to change within online retail environments. To achieve this aim, the study drew theoretical guidance from the general Stimulus-Organism-Response (SOR) paradigm. In particular, building upon web-site typology theories, the study proposed that two types of change influenced consumers’ internal responses, prompting behavioural consequences. The two types of change were Task-Relevant and Non-Task-Relevant – representing the two broad components of the retail web-site. A conceptual model was developed outlining the expected effects of change on the emotional (Arousal, Pleasure and Dominance), psychological (Flow), and cognitive (Hedonic and Utilitarian Value) states predicted to precede re-acceptance of the changed retail web-site (Attitude toward Re-patronage and Re-patronage Intention). 

To empirically examine this model, an online experiment (using a 2 x 2 between-subjects factorial design) was conducted, in which subjects were exposed to a modified version of a commercial personal banking web-site. A total of 292 responses were collected from Internet users in New Zealand. Simple linear regression, two- and three-stage hierarchical regression, and path analysis were used to analyse the dependence relationships outlined in the conceptual model. The results of the study suggest that both types of change have individual impacts on consumer response moreover, the effects are very different. In particular, Non-Task-Relevant Change appears to carry positive consequences, such as positive emotion, while the effects of Task-Relevant Change appear to carry negative consequences such as negative emotions and reduced value. Furthermore, findings suggest that offsetting the negative influences of change on emotion (particularly pleasure) can aid managers in minimising the negative consequences of change. The complete findings, their implications for the current research, and the provision of directions for future research are discussed in detail.",,,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/6514",,,"en",,,"University of Canterbury.

"3794","10092/839",,,"Bensemann, Joanne Marie",,,,,"2009",,"This study investigates copreneurship in rural tourism businesses. It explores the experiences of owners of rural tourism accommodation businesses in New Zealand within the framework of copreneurship. It also examines roles within copreneurial rural tourism businesses and studies women’s experiences of entrepreneurship specifically. Copreneurs are couples who share ownership, commitment and responsibility for a business together (Barnett and Barnett, 1989) and these couples in business together (copreneurs) are one form of family business. To date there has not been any published discussion of the concept of copreneurship and tourism, which is remarkable, given that many tourism businesses are SMEs built around lifestyle and integration of life stakeholders such as family and partners.
This dissertation represents the first attempt to study copreneurship within tourism entrepreneurship, and within a rural tourism environment specifically. It uses an interpretive approach as part of the study to give the participants a voice and to stress the methodological importance of reflexivity where the researcher is an insider to the study. Triangulation of data sources and methods, combining qualitative and quantitative techniques enables a rich understanding of copreneurial expectations, roles and responsibilities and of women’s experiences specifically. The method of the research is a postal survey of rural tourism accommodation business owners complemented by in-depth interviews with women in copreneurial business relationships.
This thesis concludes that the rural tourism accommodation sector in New Zealand is characterised by lifestylers and copreneurs running their businesses as a ‘hobby’, with the main aim being ‘to meet people’ and that non-economic, lifestyle motivations are important stimuli to business formation. Specific analysis of women’s experiences of tourism production in copreneurial situations has shown that any perception of copreneurship as a tool for enabling women to become freed from traditional gender roles may not equal the reality. Women’s voices were able to come through in both the survey and the interview part of this research, revealing that a gendered ideology persists even through copreneurial relationships in rural tourism. The copreneurs in this study have strong and widely shared preconceptions of their roles as accommodation providers and as task managers in their households; role perceptions which appear to be largely invariant of the situation. Copreneurial couples appear to engage in running the accommodation business using traditional gender-based roles mirroring those found in the private home.",,,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/3395",,,"en",,,"University of Canterbury.

 Chapter 2 gives a comparative statics analysis of a conventional model with a single principal and agent. It describes the effect on contracts of changes in the outcome of the principal-agent relationship, stating the results in the form of Slutsky equations. 
 
 Continuing with the same model, Chapter 3 allows the principal to choose an action and shows that this action can motivate the agent, and thus act as an incentive device. The model is extended further in Chapter 4, which allows agents to bargain with the principal over the outcome. In this form the model is an extension of a commodity exchange model with uncertain endowments. Using the core as a solution concept, contracts which survive bargaining among agents are derived.
 
 Chapters 5 and 6 consider moral hazard in education. In Chapter 5 the government gives loans to students, and structures loan repayments so that students' future income is to some extent insured. The government chooses the optimal level of insurance, given the possibility of shirking by students. In Chapter 6 the government hires educators, and chooses the optimal compensation of educators, given that they have an incentive to shirk. 
 
 Both models extend principal-agent theory. In Chapter 5 students choose the length of education, so that the length of the principal-agent relationship is endogenous. This may affect the optimal insurance of students' future earnings. In Chapter 6 the number of educators and the skilled wage are endogenous. In terms of principal-agency, optimal contracts are derived in a general equilibrium model in which the number of agents hired by the principal, and their opportunity cost are endogenous.",,,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/4500",,,"en",,,"University of Canterbury.

Porter’s generic strategies have been useful in describing how firms compete in the marketplace, and the resource based view has shown that resources can lead to a sustained competitive advantage. The strategic management field has begun to combine the two theories and examine the link between them. Small firms must make the best use of their relatively scarce resources. It is proposed that the relationship between resources and performance is contingent upon the positioning strategy the firm competes on, although there has only been limited supporting research to date. This research builds on work by Edelman et al. (2005) by examining the relationship between human, organisational and physical resources, and the strategies of quality/ customer service, innovation, and cost leadership in 447 retail, engineering, and professional service firms in New Zealand.

Using Structural Equations Modelling this research finds that positioning strategies are the mechanism by which firms can leverage their resources into higher performance. This relationship can be modelled as mediated or moderated, with statistical analysis sensitive to model complexity. The firm’s environment influences this relationship with different resources required to support each position depending on the industry. Specifically human, organisational, and physical resources appear to be viable sources of competitive advantage when they are leveraged by a strategy of quality/ customer service, innovation or cost leadership when the industry environment is conducive to the resource – strategy combination.",,,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/3522",,,"en",,,"University of Canterbury.

It addresses how corporate planning and budgeting are linked in their practice by government agencies in Tonga and why.

Design/methodology/approach – A qualitative approach is used to conduct an exploratory study of how OPSC practised corporate planning and programme budgeting during the 2015/2016 financial year1 (FY). An interpretivist methodology is used to analyse both primary and secondary data that were gathered using primarily a method indigenous to Pacific research known as talanoa. Literature review, participant observation, and document analysis were used to supplement data from talanoa.

Findings – The practice of corporate planning and budgeting by the Government of Tonga varies from the extensive applications documented in Western literature. Those involved in their practice are concerned with some but not all aspects of the processes depending on their positions and roles. While external consultants continually express frustrations with slow progress, indigenous government officials are somewhat confident that a lot of progress has been made. The research highlights that in the continuation of the use of corporate planning and budgeting, it must respond to prevailing needs of the country.

Originality/value – There seems to be a lack of consideration of specific contexts (e.g. existing regulations, systems etc.) in the introduction and development of concepts, ideas and processes foreign to small island countries. An example is the practice of accounting and management practices termed corporate planning and programme budgeting into the Government of Tonga. There has not been any research conducted on this in the context of the Kingdom of Tonga.

Further, many auditors and market participants have voluntarily expanded these requirements and include a materiality threshold disclosure. Despite the significant response from regulators, little research has been conducted which explores the possible impacts of this enhanced materiality disclosure.

This quantitative research, using an experiment based research design, aims to investigate whether the disclosure of materiality thresholds will have an impact on both the decisions of non-professional investors and their perceived quality of the audit.

The results of this study suggest that with a large (ten percent) materiality threshold disclosure, non-professional investors will reduce their equity based investment, in favour of risk-free NZ Government Bonds. Alternatively, non-professional investors perceive no change in the quality of audit following small (five percent) or large materiality threshold disclosure, due to lack of statistical significance.

organizations led to the sector's inclusion in the FASB's conceptual framework

New Zealand to determine whether there are special issues relating to them. It
involves a survey of thirty five charities using a pattern matching approach to
determine whether patterns observed overseas match those to be found in New
Zealand. Two of the conclusions drawn are likely to apply to all charities. The
economic focus of the conceptual framework has not been defined but charities
commonly have non-economic objectives and take part in transactions that may not
be economic events. Charities rely on receiving resources from lay users of
financial reports. The definitions adopted in the conceptual framework together
with insistence on 'conceptually pure' financial statements requiring a focus on
change in net assets is likely to result in misunderstanding of those financial
reports. Consequently such financial reports will not be decision useful. Two other
conclusions apply specifically to charities in New Zealand. Supervision of charities
and their fundraising practices is lacking and, despite the increased role of the
nonprofit sector and dependence on it, opportunities for abuse have the potential
to damage the fundraising abilities of genuine charities. The conceptual
framework's applications to the nonprofit sector requires an understanding of the

"4623","10092/839","Vosslamber, Robert John",,,,,,,"2010",,"Taxation equity may be classified into horizontal equity, where people who are in the same economic position should be taxed the same, and vertical equity, where those who differ economically should be treated differently. In the New Zealand income tax, the vertical equity norm has primarily been achieved by progressive tax rates, and by family-friendly adjustments. Given that the income tax intentionally discriminates between taxpayers on the basis of taxpayer-specific characteristics such as income level and domestic situation, the question arises as to how the New Zealand income tax in its successive manifestations has been justified as fair; that is, what vertical equity in the New Zealand income tax looked like and how it was justified.

This thesis considers the practice of the New Zealand income tax since its introduction in 1891 until 1984. By illuminating an employee’s lived experience of the income tax, it illustrates what taxation fairness actually looked like in practice, and contrasts this with the rhetoric of those responsible for the tax. It concludes that the reality of external events, rather than the rhetoric of taxation fairness, appears to have been the main driver of taxation practice. By focusing attention on the experience of the taxpayer, rather than merely on aggregated taxation data, legislative provisions or political discussion, the thesis permits the political rhetoric or fairness to be assessed against the fiscal impact on personal taxpayers.

The thesis commences by reviewing certain influences on New Zealand income tax thought: from religion, antiquity, and more particularly from certain key British philosophers. It finds that despite their importance, these do not provide a clear direction for taxation policy. The thesis then shifts from philosophical discussions of what constitutes a fair tax to look at what the income tax actually looked like in the case of a wage or salary earner. It adopts an inductive approach by calculating the effect of the income tax legislation on employees at three income levels and in three domestic situations. The resulting nine cases demonstrate how taxpayers were distinguished for the purposes of vertical equity. 

Returning to the sources, this thesis then reviews contemporary Parliamentary Debates and Reports for evidence of how Parliament justified the practice of vertical equity in the income tax. Despite frequent appeals to fairness or equity, no clear basis was found. Rather, significant changes to the income tax, and thus to the practice of vertical equity, largely reflected pragmatic responses to political or economic events. Yet once such crises had passed, the income tax, and vertical equity in that tax, did not revert to the pre-crisis shape, but rather conformed to a new paradigm.",,,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/4148",,,"en",,,"University of Canterbury.

"5612","10092/839","de Waal, Gerrit Anton",,,,,,,"2011",,"This thesis reports on the associations between a variety of factors related to the adoption and use of 76 well-known new product development (NPD) tools on NPD performance at the project level in small high technology firms. The specific factors of interest are determinants of tool adoption, tool diffusion, thoroughness of use, flexibility of use, tool adaptation, user familiarity with tools, and tool satisfaction. An invitation-only online survey was administered to 99 organisations fitting the criteria of this study to determine patterns of tool adoption and use. A variety of inferential statistical techniques was used to analyse the data. The results show lesser tool adoption patterns in comparison with larger firms elsewhere, with the majority of tools not used to their full potential. It furthermore provides useful insights into usage and performance attributes of tools, individually and collectively. Of significance is that a greater uptake of tools may not necessarily lead to increased NPD performance; instead, it is the degree of thoroughness of implementation that shows a direct association with performance improvements. 

The survey findings were followed up with in-depth case studies of five firms to investigate and explain observed phenomena, and assess the strengths and weaknesses of tool practices at the project level. The results show that practitioners’ tool needs change during the life of a project and become more sophisticated as the firm matures. They also explain why some tools are thoroughly used, and others not. 

The findings of this research have implications for both theory and practice. Theoretically, this study introduces different models and categories of tools and explains how their use can achieve a better overall understanding of tool application. Practically, the results provide managers and practitioners with several useful tool guides, benchmarking tables and models to aid in the selection and use of tools in NPD projects of any type.",,,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/5195",,,"en",,,"University of Canterbury.

The purpose of this study was to develop a substantive theory of how middle managers respond to organisational change, using the grounded theory methodology (Glaser & Strauss, 1967). Grounded theory is an inductive methodology concerned with understanding action from the perspective of the actors involved.
 
 The study was conducted in the context of local government and was bound within a single large council. The primary method of data collection was interviews. Data were collected from twenty-five middle managers over a two-year period following the launch of a major organisational change programme within the council. The data were analysed using the constant comparative method and theoretical sampling.
 
 The core variable accounting for most of the variation in the way middle managers respond to organisational change is Weighing Up, a process of the for-and-against evaluation of change. Weighing Up is conditional upon both the content and process of change. Middle managers assess the extent to which the change will meet their own psycho-social needs and, to a varying extent, the needs of others. The outcome of the Weighing Up process is an emotional state, typically some combination of the primary emotions of pleasure, anger, and apprehension. The behavioural responses of managers to change are dependent on this affective state. These responses vary across a range from active support to disaffection and exiting the organisation, and they have organisational consequences for the implementation of change.
 
 The study contributes to the understanding of organisational change in three ways; (i) it confirms previous studies that show that managers evaluate or Weigh Up change; (ii) it suggests that the response of managers to organisational change is as much emotional as rational, and; (iii) it draws attention to the importance of non-work experiential careers as an important factor in the evaluation of change.",,,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/4320",,,"en",,,"University of Canterbury.

"4802","10092/839",,,"Ballantine, P. W.",,,,,"2002",,"The main objective of this study was to examine how Web-based shopping environments influence the emotional states of consumers, and how these emotions subsequently affect their attitudes and behavioural intentions. To achieve this aim, this study drew theoretical guidance from the Mehrabian-Russell environmental psychology framework (Mehrabian and Russell 1974b). Building upon the concept of information rate outlined in this framework, this study proposed that two aspects of a Web-based shopping environment would affect the emotional states of pleasure and arousal. The two independent variables examined in this study were the level of interactivity and the depth of information provided by a Web-based shopping environment. A conceptual model was then developed outlining the relationship between these variables and the emotional states of pleasure and arousal, and the effect of these emotional states upon the response variables of Attitude toward the Website, Attitude toward the E-tailer, and Purchase Consideration.
 
 To empirically examine this model, a Web-based experiment (using a 3 x 3 between-subjects factorial design) was conducted, where subjects were exposed to a simulated online store for digital cameras. A total of 360 responses were collected from Web users in Australia and New Zealand. To help analyse the dependence relationships outlined in the conceptual model, ANCOVA, two- and three-stage hierarchical regression, and path analysis were used. The results of the study suggest that level of interactivity was a better predictor of pleasure and arousal than depth of information. Moreover, pleasure was found to be a better predictor of the response variables included in the conceptual model than arousal. The implications of these findings are discussed, along with directions for future research.",,,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/4319",,,"en",,,"University of Canterbury.

This scheme is valid only where marginal costs are known. This thesis incorporates the creation of a framework for the comparison of pharmaceutical subsidy schemes, the expansion of the Johnston and Zeckhauser scheme into an environment of imperfect information, and the comparison of this modified scheme with the variant of reference pricing used in New Zealand. This comparison finds that the Johnston and Zeckhauser scheme generally provides subsidisation at a lower cost than reference pricing provided that a suitable threshold is placed on the time taken for a firm to accept subsidisation. Unfortunately the JZ scheme does not appear to provide a valid alternative to reference pricing as, on average, it is likely to promote a lower level of efficiency than the status quo. The thesis finds that reference pricing is however not without its problems, as the possibility exists that reference pricing will, in some cases, provide firms with less than the level of profit necessary to convince them to accept subsidisation.",,,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/1998",,,"en",,,"University of Canterbury.

"4868","10092/839",,,"Shergill, Gurvinder Singh",,,,,"1989",,"This thesis investigated the extent of diversification in New Zealand companies and its effect on their administrative structure and performance. So far there has not been any study done on the diversification process of New Zealand companies although rapid changes are taking place in their strategic posture. In the second half of the twentieth century the corporate profile in advanced countries like the USA and UK had undergone significant changes as a result of diversification strategies by their business corporations. Diversification is now becoming a major corporate strategy and hence it would be useful for corporate managements, shareholders, financial institutions and other corporate investors, public policy makers and researchers to know the effectiveness of diversification in improving profitability and growth, and reducing risk. Though theoretical and empirical studies done abroad by financial, economic and business researchers suggest that only certain categories of diversification would result in higher performance, a systematic study of this subject is yet to be carried out in New Zealand. This study attempts to accomplish this. 
 
 This study addresses the following issues: (1) Have the diversification strategies affected the administrative structure of the companies and which structure is the best performer? (2) Does the performance differ among the different types of diversification strategies, for example, between related and unrelated diversification? (3) Does the strategy-structure 'fit' affect the performance of companies? A multi-industry, multi-company approach involving a sample size of 103 New Zealand listed companies in the manufacturing and non-manufacturing sector is used for establishing generalizability of the findings. Adjustment for factors such as size, industry participation, leverage and risk are also incorporated in the design of the study. The performance measures used are in the dimensions of growth and profitability. Findings of this study suggest that in general diversification is useful for reducing the risk and improving the growth and profitability. However, where diversification shows significant improvement over single business strategy, it is in the areas of reduction of risk and improving overall performance. Related diversified companies performed better than the unrelated diversifiers. Regarding the structure, division ally organized companies are having better performance, followed by holding and functional structure. Companies in the strategy-structure 'match' group are having superior performance than the mis-matched category. Finally this study discusses the implications of the findings and suggests areas for future research.",,,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/4371",,,"en",,,"University of Canterbury.

"18361","10092/839",,"Mumo, Richard Kitati",,,,,,"2017",,"In September 2010 and February 2011, the Canterbury region experienced devastating earthquakes with an estimated economic cost of over NZ$40 billion (Parker and Steenkamp, 2012; Timar et al., 2014; Potter et al., 2015). The insurance market played an important role in rebuilding the Canterbury region after the earthquakes. Homeowners, insurance and reinsurance markets and New Zealand government agencies faced a difficult task to manage the rebuild process. From an empirical and theoretic research viewpoint, the Christchurch disaster calls for an assessment of how the insurance market deals with such disasters in the future.

Previous studies have investigated market responses to losses in global catastrophes by focusing on the insurance supply-side. This study investigates both demand-side and supply-side insurance market responses to the Christchurch earthquakes. Despite the fact that New Zealand is prone to seismic activities, there are scant previous studies in the area of earthquake insurance. This study does offer a unique opportunity to examine and document the New Zealand insurance market response to catastrophe risk, providing results critical for understanding market responses after major loss events in general. A review of previous studies shows higher premiums suppress demand, but how higher premiums and a higher probability of risk affect demand is still largely unknown. According to previous studies, the supply of disaster coverage is curtailed unless the market is subsidised, however, there is still unsettled discussion on why demand decreases with time from the previous disaster even when the supply of coverage is subsidised by the government.

Natural disaster risks pose a set of challenges for insurance market players because of substantial ambiguity associated with the probability of such events occurring and high spatial correlation of catastrophe losses. Private insurance market inefficiencies due to high premiums and spatially concentrated risks calls for government intervention in the provision of natural disaster insurance to avert situations of noninsurance and underinsurance. Political economy considerations make it more likely for government support to be called for if many people are uninsured than if few people are uninsured. However, emergency assistance for property owners after catastrophe events can encourage most property owners to not buy insurance against natural disaster and develop adverse selection behaviour, generating larger future risks for homeowners and governments.

On the demand-side, this study has developed an intertemporal model to examine how demand for insurance changes post-catastrophe, and how to model it theoretically. In this intertemporal model, insurance can be sought in two sequential periods of time, and at the second period, it is known whether or not a loss event happened in period one. The results show that period one demand for insurance increases relative to the standard single period model when the second period is taken into consideration, period two insurance demand is higher post-loss, higher than both the period one demand and the period two demand without a period one loss.

To investigate policyholders experience from the demand-side perspective, a total of 1600 survey questionnaires were administered, and responses from 254 participants received representing a 16 percent response rate. Survey data was gathered from four institutions in Canterbury and is probably not representative of the entire population. The results of the survey show that the change from full replacement value policy to nominated replacement value policy is a key determinant of the direction of change in the level of insurance coverage after the earthquakes. The earthquakes also highlighted the plight of those who were underinsured, prompting policyholders to update their insurance coverage to reflect the estimated cost of re-building their property. The survey has added further evidence to the existing literature, such as those who have had a recent experience with disaster loss report increased risk perception if a similar event happens in future with females reporting a higher risk perception than males. Of the demographic variables, only gender has a relationship with changes in household cover.

On the supply-side, this study has built a risk-based pricing model suitable to generate a competitive premium rate for natural disaster insurance cover. Using illustrative data from the Christchurch Red-zone suburbs, the model generates competitive premium rates for catastrophe risk. When the proposed model incorporates the new RMS high-definition New Zealand Earthquake Model, for example, insurers can find the model useful to identify losses at a granular level so as to calculate the competitive premium.

This study observes that the key to the success of the New Zealand dual insurance system despite the high prevalence of catastrophe losses are; firstly the EQC’s flat-rate pricing structure keeps private insurance premiums affordable and very high nationwide homeowner take-up rates of natural disaster insurance. Secondly, private insurers and the EQC have an elaborate reinsurance arrangement in place. By efficiently transferring risk to the reinsurer, the cost of writing primary insurance is considerably reduced ultimately expanding primary insurance capacity and supply of insurance coverage.",,,,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/14908",,"en","English",,"University of Canterbury",,,,,"http://library.canterbury.ac.nz/thesis/etheses_copyright.shtml",,"All Rights Reserved",,,,,,,,,,,"Post-catastrophe insurance supply and demand: theory and evidence",,,"Electronic Thesis or Dissertation",,"Economics",,,"University of Canterbury",,"Doctoral",,,"Doctor of Philosophy",,"2586164",,,"College of Business and Law, University of Canterbury",,,"kitatimumo@gmail.com  richard.mumo@dkut.ac.ke",,,,,,,,"Associate Professor Richard Watt"

Particularly, there is much research determining appropriate routing systems. However, given recent improvements in routing technologies and the potential growth in services which require more computing resources, it has become important for service providers to examine their networks from a processing capacity point of view, as these resources are a new potential bottleneck.
 
 This thesis presents models that mathematically describe aspects of processing investment and service provision, given distributed processing in modem communication networks. Unlike previous research, aspects considered include delivery times, quality of service, and congestion. The model developed is different from the standard capacity expansion/facility location models in that the capacity decisions implicitly influence demand.
 
 The mathematical models developed in this thesis for the capacity investment problem contain integer decision variables and uncertain parameters in a two-stage stochastic integer programming framework. These aspects add significant complexity to the model. Therefore, another important contribution of this thesis is the investigation into the impact of making model approximations to reduce this complexity. This enables better understanding of the model by illustrating the relative importance of the model's complex aspects.",,,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/4505",,,"en",,,"University of Canterbury.

This thesis uses a new cash flow-based analytical tool to derive an additional performance measure of a company, the Mount Cook Group. This analysis is compared with a traditional ratio-based analysis to test if the cash flow-based tool has provided any new information. The time period examined is 1930 to 1990, covering sixty years of significant changes, both within the organisation and externally. The changing environment helps to test the cash flow model in different circumstances.
 The quantitative analyses provided by the traditional ratios and the cash flow model are supported by an historical analysis which draws on documentary sources, and interviews conducted with past employees, and with members of the founder's family. Understanding financial performance requires an appreciation of the qualitative factors influencing the organisation. The success of the Mount Cook Group was attributable to the founder, and his son, who became the managing director, following the founder's death. The study therefore includes an examination of the influence of these people, and their entrepreneurship.
 There is a need to balance financial information with non-financial information, both from within the organisation and externally, from other influences, such as factors influencing the economic environment in which the organisation operates. The backward-looking perspective of accounting information puts accountants in a poor position to offer their skills as business experts, and this case study illustrates the importance of forward-looking entrepreneurial views.",,,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/4888",,,"en",,,"University of Canterbury.

Half the academic research in Australia is now estimated to be undertaken in research Centres. During the nineteen-nineties, the numbers of Australian university Centres multiplied rapidly, in response to changes in government funding policy. The introduction of the Unified National System of higher education in 1988 meant that along with many new universities came many new research Centres. As each Centre requires a Director, numerous academics have taken on this role. Sparse prior research on university research Centre Directors indicated the need for an exploratory study to examine the underlying issues related to their work. This thesis unravels the multiple realities within the Directors' lives, in the rapidly changing environment of higher education. Seven Directors and their colleagues, in two well established and four
comparatively new Centres, participated in qualitative case studies. The major issues
impacting on Directors emerged as; the complex, multi-faced nature of their role, the
constancy of the search for funding, the impact of Centre structure within the host
university, and the importance of collegial support from superiors. Interpretive analysis
was used to develop concepts for the often conflicting expectations interested patties hold
of the Director.
Directors were found to vary in their use of the skills of Directorship;
grantsmanship; partnering with the host university and sponsors; watchful expectancy
over Centre colleagues to ensure quality; and proactive involvement outside the
university to influence research outcomes. Directors rarely receive formal training or
mentoring for their role, but learn from good and poor exemplars. In the competitive
research funding environment, success emerged as survival of the Centre.
Several practical suggestions are forthcoming for appropriate support for new
university research Centre Directors, for university administrators, and for further
research.",,,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/4856",,,"en",,,"University of Canterbury.

As a result, the electricity industry's development will, in turn, directly influence other industries, people's daily lives, and the whole economy. China is one of the most rapidly developing economies, making it one of the biggest consumer of electricity in the world. Thus, the development of electric industry in China is not only important for the development of China itself, but also the energy pattern all over the world.


In this study, we focus on analysing the market-oriented reform in China's electricity industry after the adoption of reforming and opening policies in 1978. By following the time path, the detailed content of the reform, as it was applied and modified over time, is first introduced. Then, an empirical investigation is conducted on the major policies in the process of China's electric power industry reform. Through quantitative measurement, the contribution of each major policy is clearly defined, so that conclusions concerning the reform in the past and suggestions for its future direction can be reached and made.


It is found that both successes and deficiencies occurred in the reform process, and that China's electric industry has made significant efforts to overcome obstacles as they have been identified. However, even though great progress has been made in China's electric power industry from 1978 to 2009, more efforts are still required to finally achieve market operation in the industry. It is expected that this study can positively contribute to the development of China's electric power industry, as well as to electric power industries in other countries.",,,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/5177",,,"en",,,"University of Canterbury.

The study’s hypotheses were tested using the responses to questionnaire surveys (which included two scenarios) and in-depth telephone interviews, which were conducted sequentially in both countries. Partial Least Squares and thematic analysis were used to analyse the surveys and interviews data, respectively. 

The results suggest that Malaysian taxpayers have significantly better perceptions of fairness of their income tax systems than their New Zealand counterparts, yet New Zealand taxpayers are more compliant. The most consistently important factor in explaining taxpayers’ compliance behaviour across the two countries is their attitude towards compliance, followed by subjective norms. Fairness perceptions, which are highly influenced by their tax knowledge and perceived complexity of the tax system, are also influential, particularly in the understating other incomes scenario.

"5520","10092/839",,,"McKnight, Susan",,,,,"2010",,"'Customer value' is a much used and, in a number of cases, a misunderstood term, with emphasis placed on a priori categories of what provides value for the customer, rather than an effort to understand value from a customer perspective .The research presented in this thesis spans more than ten years in two academic library services, (one in Australia and the other in the United Kingdom), using a methodology that does not use pre-determined value dimensions but, rather, dimensions identified by the customers themselves. This action research was carried out with different customer segments in the university libraries to identify customer values and irritations. By longitudinal tracking of student satisfaction in the UK university, changes in customer satisfaction were noted and related to interventions agreed by library management based on the research data gathered.
The thesis answers four specific research questions. By focussing on customer-defined dimensions of 'value' and the concept of 'customer irritation', through use of the Customer Value Discovery methodology, this research has been able to identify a set of core academic library customer values that traditional library benchmarking instruments have not previously highlighted. The attendant results of the application of the methodology to discern these values, and their use to inform subsequent change management processes, show that customer satisfaction is improved if changes are made to services and resources to both deliver customer-defined values and reduce customer-defined irritations. Further, they show that library staff assumptions regarding customer expectations and customer perceptions of service are not always accurate. Therefore, management should seek input from customers and base decisions regarding service changes and improvements to meet customer expectations on customer-derived evidence. At the same time, the active engagement of library staff in the Customer Value Discovery process, their engagement in modelling potential interventions to add value and reduce irritation, and then in the decision-making and implementation of agreed actions, encourages greater staff 'buy-in' to the change management process, as the changes are customer-led, and staff driven, rather than being management imposed. The research supported the awarding of the UK Cabinet Office's Customer Service Excellence accreditation, attesting to the usefulness of the methodology to ensure customer-focussed services.
Taken together, these findings fill a number of gaps in the professional literature, and make a series of contributions to the extant knowledge base, by providing details of the Customer Value Discovery methodology and its usefulness in an academic library context; by presenting the application of a methodology that enables easy and precise identification of value dimensions from the perspective of the customer; and by providing practitioners with case studies of actions that improved customer satisfaction of the library services. As such, the research constitutes a significant contribution, not only to evidence-based library and information practice, informing library management decision-making, but also to the wider field of customer service management.",,,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/5097",,,"en",,,"Nottingham Business School, Nottingham Trent University",,,"NZCU",,"http://library.canterbury.ac.nz/thesis/etheses_copyright.shtml",,"Copyright Susan McKnight",,,,,,,,,,,"Library Decision Making Informed by Customer Values","Theses / Dissertations",,,,,,,"Nottingham Trent",,"Doctoral",,,"Doctor of Philosophy (PhD)",,,,,"College of Business and Law",,,,,,"237699",,,,,"Baback Yazdani"
"5922","10092/839",,,"George, John Andrew",,,,,"1979",,"This thesis deals with the effectiveness of various decision rules derived to approximate the objective function of a quadratic programme. The assumption of the study is that the constraint set of the QP is known precisely but the objective function is known only from the data of various observations made of that function. Various decision rules, some linear and some non-linear, are used to derive from the data objective functions to approximate the true but unknown function.
 A series of problems are generated to test the effectiveness of these decision rules. The problems are stratified according to the nature of the true quadratic function and the size of the problem in terms of the number of constraints and variables. In addition to comparing the decision rules with each other the study also considers the effects of the type of quadratic function (matrix type), the size of the problem, the number of observations, the scatter pattern of the observations and the curvature (degree of nonlinearity) of the quadratic.
 In general the decision rules do not behave well except when the curvature is very slight. In most other cases the nonlinear decision rules give much the best results and particularly if the observations are scattered close to the true contrained optimum. The overall conclusion is that it is well worth the effort to obtain an accurate statement of the true objective function unless the function is known to be only slightly nonlinear.",,,,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/5490",,"en",,,"University of Canterbury.

A significant issue for the firm is the increasing importance of human capital in the knowledge economy and thus we examine the theory of the human-capital based firm. In the first section of the Introduction three questions are asked, What is a knowledge economy? How can we measure such an economy? and Can we know if we are in a new economy?, but only the last of them can be answered and only positively for the U.S. After this a brief survey of the theory of the firm literature is given. Chapter 2 argues that the current mainstream approaches to firm do not deal well with the human-capital based firm. Chapter 3 looks in more detail at the two extensions of the Grossman Hart Moore approach to modelling the human-capital based firm. The discussion centres on Brynjolfsson (1994) and Rabin (1993). An error in one of Rabin’s proofs is noted. As these papers are the mainstay of the orthodoxy approach to the human-capital based firm we discuss them in detail as a spring-board to developing a more satisfactory model of the human-capital based firm in the following chapters. Chapter 4 turns to a discussion of the more recent “reference point” approach to the firm. Chapter 5 attempts to apply the reference point approach to the human-capital based firm. Two models are developed. The first suggests that heterogeneity of references matters in determining the outcome when choosing between the use of independent contractors and employees. When preferences are homogeneous, the first best and the optimal level of co-ordination can be achieved. Here the scope of the firm is clear. In some cases the activities of the firm are undertaken in-house while in others an independent contractor is utilised. Heterogeneity of preferences results in outcomes, which include deadweight losses, being determined by both the sign and the size of the change in the benefits to the agents. Both under and over levels of co-ordination can occur. The scope of the firm is inconclusive. This suggests that the organisation of a human capital based firm depends on the “types” of human capital in the firm. Having a homogeneous group of human capital involved in a firm may well lead to a different
organisational form than that found in a firm which involves a heterogeneous group of human capital. This issue is examined in the following section of the chapter. A model
is developed in which the optimal organisational form is determined by two conditions: 1) a “Make-or-Buy” constraint which picks an independent contractor contract or an employment contract depending on which contractual type results in the optimal of two widgets being chosen and 2) if an employment contract is chosen then the owner of the integrated firm is whoever has the highest “aggrievement level”, and thus will “shade” the most. Some of the conclusions give conditions under which more than one
of the possible organisational forms result in the efficient outcome. What the results of Chapter 5 suggest is that a human-capital only firm with heterogeneous human capital is likely to be unstable and thus a long lasting human-capital only firm will consist of homogeneous human capital. A firm which involves heterogeneous human capital will require some “glue”, in the form of non-human capital of some kind, to
remain viable. Given the importance of this glue to the firm ownership of the firm by the owner of the non-human capital is likely. Chapter 6 is the conclusion.",,,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/5760",,,"en",,,"University of Canterbury.

"6434","10092/839","Dalley, Jeffrey Brian",,,,,,,"2011",,"The purpose of this study is to develop deeper understanding of the informal contributions of employees to organisational success; more specifically, the exchange ‘mechanism’ by which resources accrue to organisations through the social relationships of their members. The second purpose is to explore the influence of organisational contextual factors on this exchange mechanism; more specifically, the influence – if any – of contingent employment practices.

Through the use of a qualitative research design, I have gained an in-depth understanding of the cognitive mechanism employed by organisational actors to arrive at a decision on whether or not to initiate social exchange, in order to facilitate the flow of organisational social capital.

Data was analysed using Dimensional Analysis method. This analysis draws on the theoretical perspectives of interpretivism and symbolic interactionism, both of which are underpinned by a social construction epistemology. This provides the necessary link for understanding the connections between macro- and micro-level social action of social exchange in organisational settings.

My findings identify a complex cognitive process employed by actors for the purpose of reaching a decision with respect to initiating social exchange in organisational settings. This process is termed Social Exchange Transaction Analysis. It is undertaken at the individual level and ultimately controls the flow of organisational social capital through a social network to the organisation. This complexity is a reflection of both the many dimensions of the phenomenon, and the interconnectedness and interactions between them. Social Exchange Transaction Analysis builds an ‘analytical’ picture of the potential social exchange transaction, to enable the organisational actor to arrive at a decision on whether or not to initiate social exchange – and thereby facilitate the flow of organisational social capital.",,,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/6001",,,"en",,,"University of Canterbury.

"6367","10092/839","Lawrence, Janika Mary Natasha",,,,,,,"2011",,"Communication is fundamental to the ongoing function of an organisation. Its study is important in order for communication managers to refine internal communication processes and achieve employee engagement, particularly with change communication. To gain a comprehensive understanding of the way communication is experienced in an organisation, it is necessary to examine it from the communicators' perspectives. An interpretive research approach seeks to understand phenomena from subjects‟ perspectives and so provided an ideal research framework for this study.
This thesis reports on a study of the sense frontline staff within a large public health organisation made of the change communication related to the introduction of the change initiative Making Time for Caring (MT4C) and presents the conceptual model of sensemaking about change communication that emerged from this study. In so doing, it provides a rich picture of participants‟ sensemaking behaviour and a conceptual framework that could assist communication managers refine their internal communication management practices during change in similar organisations.
Participants were selected from two primary hospitals within the chosen District Health Board. Both had implemented MT4C and the subsequent Fast Track Rollout (FTR) change initiatives that aimed to improve ward efficiency so staff had increased time to spend with patients. Using an interpretive approach, participants‟ accounts of their engagement with the associated change communication were gathered through three data collection phases, and analysed in order to develop a model that accounted for their engagement with the communication related to these two change initiatives.
The media utilised in the change communication campaigns and the perceived relevancy of this communication to the work being undertaken were found to be primary considerations participants took into account when judging whether to engage with the change process.. Additionally, a culture of time poverty and unique workplace network divisions were found to modify the process of engaging with internal communication. The emergent model that
captures these findings thus integrates considerations of media, relevance, organisational culture and social relations. In so doing, it provides a unique contribution to the change management and organisational communication literatures that could be used as a framework for further study.",,,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/5935",,,"en",,,"University of Canterbury.

"5530","10092/839","Ranathunga Arachchige, Ranga Prabodanie",,,,,,,"2010",,"Nitrate discharges from diffuse agricultural sources have long term effects on groundwater and surface water quality. Market-based instruments have been proposed as a means of balancing the demand for nitrate intensive farming and the capacity of the natural water bodies to dilute nitrates. Trading is complicated by the dispersed, delayed, and protracted effects of diffuse sources. Market mechanisms proposed to date have failed to incorporate these physical characteristics of nitrate pollution correctly.

We propose a new market mechanism for allocating and pricing nitrate discharge permits, based on the design of modern electricity markets which use LP models to find optimal prices and dispatch schedules. The system operates as a centralized auction. The sources submit bids to the auction indicating the benefits gained from each unit of nitrate discharge. The auction operator runs an LP which maximises the benefits from trade, subject to a set of environmental and operational constraints. The LP solution produces the optimal prices and allocations relative to the economic values indicated in the bids.

Our contributions include alternative LP models to suit different hydro-geological and socio-economic conditions. We present a generalized LP model which can include constraints that describe nitrate residence and transport in groundwater and surface water, the ability of water bodies to accept nitrates, and the operational limitations of the commercial sources. We show how to adapt available methods to incorporate the complex physical systems into an optimisation model. We present a double-sided market model which allows the polluters to buy permits, and environmental agents to lease out the ability of the natural water resources to accept nitrates. The model allows the providers of environmental services to participate in the market as sellers.

We build up and prove the concepts by explaining the prices and allocations produced by the LP models. Based on the theory of nodal pricing applied in electricity markets, we discuss the price structures and relationships and show how the prices would reflect the spatial and temporal effects of diffuse nitrate discharges. We interpret the information generated from the outcomes of trading and discuss how the available tools and information can be used by the market participants to optimize their bids. We expand the proposed market model to include point sources, and identify the factors that determine the extent to which the point and nonpoint sources can trade with each other. In addition, we develop measures of the extent to which the diffuse sources themselves can trade with each other. We demonstrate the models and the resulting prices and allocations, using a catchment nitrate transport model.",,,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/5144",,,"en",,,"University of Canterbury.

"6565","10092/839",,,"Read, E. G.",,,,,"1979",,"This thesis is primarily concerned with the solution of the long-term scheduling problem for mixed hydro-thermal systems such as that of the former New Zealand Electricity Department (NZED - now the Electricity Division of the Ministry of Energy).
 Chapters 2 to 6 describe our model for the solution of the deterministic version of this problem. This model, an adaptation of the Electricité de France (EDF) models outlined in Appendix A, involves the use of ""energy prices"" (Lagrange multipliers) to decompose the problem into manageable sub-problems. Our model differs from that of the EDF in the following ways. Firstly, instead of dealing with aggregate national loads, it is a multi-load
 model in which losses and restrictions in the transmission system are explicitly modelled. Secondly, we have adopted a more flexible scheme to ensure that short-term requirements are met. In particular we have developed a new approach to the scheduling of river chains in the short-term. Thirdly, we have generalised their approach so as to handle more realistic (non-convex) cost (and loss) functions. Finally, the nature of the NZED system (and
 of our model) has required the adoption of a more sophisticated approach to the adjustment of the ""prices"". Chapter 7 describes the application of this approach to the NZED system.
 Chapter 8 uses some recent results on the optimal recourse problem to generalise this model into a stochastic framework. Chapter 9 uses this abstract stochastic model to analyse some earlier approaches and to suggest a new method for the solution of realistic stochastic
 scheduling problems.
 Finally, Chapter 10 shows how the prices developed in the solution of the scheduling problem may be used in other contexts. In particular, a simple adaptation allows the ""optimal tariff problem"" to be solved exactly.",,,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/6149",,,"en",,,"University of Canterbury.

"5356","10092/839","Li, Min",,,,,,,"2010",,"Primarily, this research provides insight on a management accounting change in a Chinese state-owned enterprise (SOE) from institutional perspective. Comprising a qualitative field study, the research examines and explains how and why a management accounting change occurred in the SOE, which is the oldest and largest beer producer in China. The study focuses on the introduction and usage of a Balanced Scorecard (BSC), at both the headquarters and the factory level of the organization. The framework of institutionalization proposed by Burns and Scapens (2000) is utilized as the theoretical framework for this research. The major findings take the form of a comparison between the usage of the BSCs at the headquarters and at the factories. It is found that higher resistance to change occurred in the factories than at headquarters and resulted in the rules required by these management accounting practices to be only loosely coupled with routines embedded in everyday working activities, as the factories carried on brewing their beer. In contrast, behaviors at headquarters were more tightly coupled with the rules of the revised accounting practices. This diversity in the effect of the change process may be explained by the new management accounting practices entailing rules that fit better with the activities and routines carried out at headquarters, and so being more easily institutionalized. In contrast, institutionalization has not had much success in the factories primarily because of a lack of fit between complying with the new rules and maintaining the success of brewing operations, and because of historical circumstances that the factories have had some independence in operational matters, although part of an organizational hierarchy. Given the location of this study in a Chinese setting, the findings may contribute that, despite its Western roots, institutional theory may explain the low success rate of the implementation of the BSC in China.",,,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/4946",,,"en",,,"University of Canterbury.

"6687","10092/839","Ji, Xu",,,,,,,"2011",,"This research primarily examines the trends of changing characteristics of corporate boards within New Zealand listed firms. Expressing in a quantitative framework, this research provides an insight of how board compositions have changed over the past decade, within which two major corporate governance legislative reforms have occurred. These two reforms are known as the Companies Act in 1993 and the New Zealand Corporate Governance Best Practice Code in 2003.

This study aims to cover a full range of board characteristics mentioned in previous related literatures in order to give a more complete view. Sixteen variables are selected and examined: board size, board independence, multiple directorships, CEO compensation, chair and director fees, CEO duality, gender diversity, staggered board, directors' ownership, director tenure, directors' experience, committee existence, committee independence, CEO involvement on board committees, board and committee Meetings, directors' educational and industrial background.

Within the above variables, board size, board independence and CEO duality receives the most attention from New Zealand investors and regulators. Tendencies of movements regarding these characteristics appear to collaborate with public expectations. Board size has decreased while independence has increased throughout the periods examined. CEO duality phenomenon sharply reduced during the periods after 2003 legislative reform. Committee independence has also grown according to the public recognition, especially for audit committees. CEO involvements on board committees are less than before. Boards within New Zealand listed firms desire more diversification of both gender and backgrounds of directors. These findings fill the gap of the evolution of corporate boards’ characteristics of New Zealand listed firms over the past decade.",,,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/6255",,,"en",,,"University of Canterbury.

"6653","10092/839","Ormandy, Elizabeth Mary",,,,,,,"2011",,"This study investigated the behaviour of re-gifting using both qualitative and quantitative research methods. Re-gifting is the gift-giving behaviour of giving a gift that was previously given to you, to another with the pretence that you purchased the gift. The qualitative phase used semi-structured interviews to uncover an initial understanding of re-gifting behaviour from participants’ selected using purposive sampling. The main findings arising from this phase showed that re-gifters used three main factors to determine when it is appropriate to re-gift. These three factors, relationship, occasion and gift were used as the basis of the conceptual framework.  This framework was then analysed using an online experiment with the use of vignette techniques which was the focus of the quantitative phase. 
The study focused on understanding what influences individuals decisions to re-gift. The main factors of interest were how the gift, occasion and relationships involved influenced re-gifting intentions. Re-gifting attitudes where analysed using the factors gift-giving attitudes, previous re-gifting experiences and frequency of re-gifting. A total of 211 responses were collected from Web users from around the world. The study suggests that re-gifters are influenced by the relationships involved and the type of gift, not the occasion. Re-gifting attitudes can be influenced by previous re-gifting experiences. This study has numerous practical implications, more specifically for retailers and charity organisations. This study adds major contributions to both gift-giving and disposition literature and introduces the area of re-gifting.

"7348","10092/839","Syed Marzuki, Sharifah Zannierah",,,,,,,"2012",,"This study focuses on the expectations of restaurant managers and perceived attributes of halal certification in Malaysia. Halal certification at restaurants represents the understanding that foods is served according to Islamic dietary laws. Halal means permitted or lawful or fit for consumption. As well as its importance in Muslim countries, the demand for halal food is growing internationally as a result of increasing trade, tourism and globalization. Therefore, halal certification is seen as an important aspect in both the Malaysian and the international restaurant and hospitality industries. Halal certification in an eating premises means that both the restaurants, as well as the entire food supply chain, conform to Islamic dietary rules which do not tolerate contamination by haram (prohibited) materials. 

Research for this thesis was undertaken by both a mail survey and interviews with restaurant managers. For the survey, a systematic sampling method was applied whereby every fourth restaurant was selected from a list of all restaurants in Malaysia provided by the Companies Commission. A mail survey to 2080 restaurants was administered throughout Malaysia in July 2009. The number of completed and returned questionnaires was 643, indicating a 31% response rate. Data was then entered into a Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) for further analysis. The response rate was considered reasonable given the nature of the study and its limitations. In addition, 33 interviews with restaurant managers were conducted in five locations. 

The results indicate that restaurant managers have high expectations towards halal certification although there are different expectations between Muslim and non-Muslim respondents with respect to attributes such as food safety, hygiene, food quality, marketing aspects and certification issues. It is also gathered that there are significant differences between them with respect to market signals, Islamic attributes, marketing benefits, cost of compliance and local awareness. This thesis concludes that halal certification does yield some benefits in terms of market signals, Islamic attributes and marketing factors while there are also certain issues on cost and compliance that need to be addressed by related local authorities. The findings also indicate that halal restaurant food may have a broader appeal beyond religion and also contributes to Malaysia’s positioning as a tourism destination and a hub for the global halal market.",,,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/6867",,,"en",,,"University of Canterbury.

"7750","10092/839",,,"Allan, Sarah Jane",,,,,"2004",,"The boundaryless career has become a remarkably popular, albeit contentious, concept, with various academics and practitioners offering cautionary notes concerning the lack of understanding of boundary less career implications. This thesis argues that the boundaryless career concept is theoretically and empirically under-developed with regard to the impact of such careers, particularly those in what literature appears to consider 'non-professional' occupations. Beginning with a review of existing boundaryless career literature, this thesis moves on to introduce the notion of dairy farming as a boundaryless career and provides an insight into the impact such a career can have. Observations and interviews are then combined to produce an ethnographic case study of the experiences of the Culverden community with the findings being presented in three sections - individual, family and community. The discussion of each of these sections partially supports prevailing literature by confirming the existence of a number of positive aspects of boundaryless careers. At the same time however, these discussions identify a number of negative aspects associated with this type of career. The limitations of existing research are thus highlighted through confirming that career literature neglects the potential impacts of the positive aspects it regularly refers to, and almost entirely overlooks potential impacts of the negative aspects of boundaryless careers. This thesis therefore has not only theoretical significance through contributing to existing literature by providing insight into both the positive and negative impacts of boundaryless careers from not only an individual perspective, but also a family and community perspective, but also practical significance in that it provides an awareness of the potential implications of the boundaryless nature of dairy farming which may aid in the development of strategies to address problems and simultaneously take advantage of the opportunities created by the boundaryless nature of dairy farming. In this way, this thesis has the potential to play a crucial role in the maintenance of a cohesive, sustainable rural community.",,,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/7185",,,"en",,,"University of Canterbury.

"8127","10092/839","Dokkularb, Piyarat",,,,,,,"2013",,"The purpose of this study is to add to our knowledge of the composition and exercise of management control systems (MCSs). The study focused on a Thai-owned chicken processing company in Thailand. Although most previous studies on MCSs have examined the use of MCSs as developed in mainly English-speaking countries in the West, there are some studies set in emerging economies in South and Southeast Asia around Thailand. These have found a variety of factors that affect the composition and exercise of MCSs. These factors include national culture, employers’ and employees’ demographic characteristics, ethnic tensions, political intervention, and liberalisation and privatisation.

Thailand was chosen for this study because the author is Thai and because few previous studies had been done about Thailand. Thailand has been influenced significantly by Western ideas but differs from many of its South and Southeast Asian neighbours, such as Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and Indonesia, in having maintained a much greater degree of formal political autonomy than these countries. Its national culture differs from these neighbouring places.

The researcher took an ethnographic approach to her study. Empirical materials were collected about the Saha Farms Company, a large family business, with the cooperation of the owners, including the founder, who is still the chairman. Methods included non-participant observation, semi-structured and unstructured interviews, examination of documents, such as websites, newspapers and graduation booklets, and informal social contacts, such as conversations over a meal. The materials were interpreted to obtain an in-depth knowledge of the social life that underpins MCSs exercised in the Company.

The findings indicate that some factors from previous studies, namely national culture and demographic characteristics, are relevant to the Saha Farms Company’s MCSs. They also indicate that other factors not identified in previous studies are important; for example, being a family business, competition in the markets for labour and custom, and labour laws have influenced and shaped the Company’s MCSs. All of these reflect a Thai culture that is unique, unspoilt by European colonialism, and still rooted in three fundamentals, namely the nation, Buddhism and the monarchy. Conversely other factors found in previous studies, such as ethnic tensions, political intervention, and liberalisation and privatisation, seem not to be relevant in the Saha Farms Company.

The findings of this research could be extended further in future research to obtain a broader picture of MCSs in use in Thailand. For example, these findings could be compared with the MCSs in a Thai family business in which the founder is no longer involved. A Thai non-family business and a Thai subsidiary or Thai head office of an international business could be studied; or a company based in an urban area.",,,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/7543",,,"en",,,"University of Canterbury.

This comparative analysis of the survey time series provides value to the existing New Zealand wine tourism research by illustrating how wineries in New Zealand have used tourism as part of their business strategy.  The findings reveal that there are many significant gaps in what is known about the character of the New Zealand wine tourist, and also of the industry itself. Biosecurity and sustainability issues are examined, and for the first time in wine tourism research anywhere in the world a section dedicated to innovation within the context of wine tourism is also included.

Though the nature of wine tourism in New Zealand appears to fluctuate, the generally positive attitude of the wine industry towards tourism indicated in this study suggests that there is still unrealised potential within the industry, provided that it is both safeguarded against external threats, and is also promoted correctly through the appropriate channels in order to assure future growth.",,,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/7598",,,"en",,,"University of Canterbury.

This research takes one such framework aimed at small firms (Lymer et al., 1997b) and attempts to validate its usefulness by comparing it to similar and conflicting models, and by applying it to impacts collected from both the literature and from four case studies of small firms. The findings suggest that several changes to Lymer et al.'s (1997b) framework are necessary to make the model more effective and more practical for researchers and practitioners. A revised Internet impacts model is proposed that incorporates these changes.

"8394","10092/839","Ng, Poh Yen",,,,,,,"2013",,"This study advances understanding of the complexity of high growth in technology-based businesses. The study builds on conceptual and applied insights on business growth from the entrepreneurship and strategic management literatures. This thesis uses both qualitative and quantitative methods to develop and then test a model of the performance of high-growth firms. The qualitative study involved case studies of high-growth firms in Malaysia and New Zealand and led to a conceptual model of their performance. This model was then estimated using original data gathered from a questionnaire survey of a cross-section of high-growth and non-high-growth firms. The model was estimated separately on samples of high-growth and non-high-growth firms and, as expected, it proved a much stronger explanation of the performance of the high-growth sample. Hence the thesis provides important new insights into this small but important group of firms.
Sixteen high-growth firms, selected in equal number from Malaysia and New Zealand, agreed to be case studies in the initial phase of the research. Interviews with the CEO/owners and other evidence from these firms led to a conceptual framework of their high-growth experience. This framework highlighted the importance of supportive government policies; internal human resources; external relationships/networks; and the ability of management to dynamically manipulate these resources. Further, the high-growth strategies: product innovation, market expansion, remaining-in-private-ownership and strategy flexibility were underpinned by five main capabilities: innovation, financial, human, marketing and organisational. Challenges from both internal and external environments also influenced growth performance.
This conceptual framework was the source of a number of hypotheses that were then tested using a statistically valid sample of firms. A survey was conducted on technology-based firms in the two countries. A total of 163 responses were collected from key decision makers in these firms. The empirical results showed different impacts of the dimensions mentioned in performance in the two countries. Due to limited responses in Malaysia (n=53), conclusions could only be made based on the New Zealand context (n=110). Product innovation was found to be a major strategy for
ix
all technology-based firms regardless of their performance. However, the results suggest that growth challenges have greater influence on high-growth firms than on firms with lower growth. The model has significantly higher statistical power when applied to a sample of high-growth firms, confirming differences between the two groups.
This thesis has significant theoretical and practical implications. From a theoretical viewpoint, this study provides detailed evaluation on the growth determinants from a process perspective. All the resources identified in the qualitative study influenced some of the capabilities, and the innovation, marketing and human capabilities each had significant relationships with the growth strategies implemented. The performance of technology-based firms was influenced by three major strategies: market expansion, product innovation and remaining-in-private-ownership, and also by two growth challenges: financial barriers and external environment effects. The results also indicate that success of the market expansion strategy is tied to product innovation strategy, while remaining-in-private-ownership is positively related to performance. As such, technology-based firms should give priority to product innovation strategy in pursuing better performance. From a practical viewpoint, these findings indicate that the competitiveness of technology-based firms can be enhanced by working closely with key stakeholders who provide growth resources, and developing critical capabilities to assist the right strategies for better performance.",,,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/7799",,,"en",,,"University of Canterbury.

In Part A the concept of party autonomy is discussed and the traditional English approach considered. This involves a critical examination of the proper law doctrine.
 Part B considers the 'American Solution' with particular reference to the State of New York. Interest Analysis, New York legislation and common law are discussed. A criticism of the New York approach concludes this section.
 In Part C the limitations on party autonomy are considered in both the English and New York setting.
 In Part D four alternative proposals are canvassed. The lex loci contractus and the lex loci solutionis (the law of the place of contracting and the law of the place of performance) are briefly considered in an historical setting. These two theories contrast with the lex validatis (the law which validates) which an academic suggestion. Finally the European Convention on the Law Applicable to Contractual Obligations (1980) is chosen as a legislative proposal to resolve the choice of law dilemma for international contracts. Its provisions are stated and discussed.
 Parts A to D demonstrate that law to govern international contracts on both sides of the Atlantic is unsatisfactory. To date New Zealand has followed the English proper law doctrine. However it is submitted that the time for change has arrived. It is argued that New Zealand needs a law which advances conflict of laws goals, avoids present difficulties and which is in harmony with domestic contract law. Thus Part E considers such goals and the domestic and conflict of laws provisions of recent national contractual legislation. A legislative solution is then proposed and it is argued that if the proposals were adopted New Zealand would have gone a long way towards resolving choice of law issues for international contracts.",,,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/7791",,,"en",,,"University of Canterbury.

"8128","10092/839","Smart, Martha",,,,,,,"2012",,"The Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB) has received considerable attention in the behavioural literature, but not in the tax compliance domain. The key purpose of this study is to determine the influence of selected tax compliance variables on tax compliance behaviour. The secondary objectives are to explore the applicability of the TPB in predicting and explaining tax compliance behaviour, and to provide justification for the application of Structural Equation Modelling (SEM) employing the Partial Least Squares (PLS) statistical software or PLS-Graph (which has not been widely used in tax compliance research). The results provide evidence supporting the use of PLS-Graph in undertaking SEM analysis in tax compliance research, especially when smaller samples are involved and the data collected may not be normally distributed. This study also demonstrated the wide applicability of the TPB, including its application in tax compliance research.
This study modified and extended the standard TPB behavioural model with the inclusion of a number of economic and noneconomic constructs. Most of the constructs used for this study are grounded in a number of theories: Deterrence Theory; Procedural Justice Theory; and Motivational Posturing Theory; in addition to the TPB. Data to test the research hypotheses was collected using a mail and a web-based survey. 
The results of this study suggest that noneconomic variables, such as beliefs and attitudes, are good predictors of tax compliance behaviour. Consistent with the majority of studies, the most influential factor in predicting and explaining tax compliance behaviour (through the mediating effects of behavioural intention) is attitude towards the behaviour. Other factors such as personal, social and societal norms were also significant predictors of tax compliance behaviour. Perceived behavioural control was only significant for the taxpayers but not for the tax agents. In contrast, perception of the tax authority was significant for New Zealand tax agents, but not for taxpayers. The results also suggest that tax compliance behaviour is complex, and different determinants of compliance behaviour affects different sub-groups of taxpayers differently. The results lend further support to the literature that indicates that taxpayers are not a homogeneous group. This study also found that taxpayers and tax agents generally perceive tax noncompliance as less serious relative to a number of other similar civil offences. This perception may explain why respondents (from both sample groups) who were penalised for noncompliance felt that the penalties imposed were harsh, unfair and excessive.   
Overall, the current study illustrates the importance of incorporating noneconomic variables comprising beliefs, attitudes, and norms, with widely used economic variables such as penalties and other enforcement tools, for achieving an optimal compliance strategy.

"18896","10092/839","McMillan, James",,,,,,,"2018",,"Contactless payment is a modern addition to transaction technology and has gained traction in New Zealand through the advent of contactless bank cards. Consumers no longer require security PINs for low value transactions which creates faster payments and reduces queuing times. However, reduced security has given rise to card theft, fraudulent transactions and criticism from consumers who feel they have little control over payment instruments. Despite ample academic attention given towards contactless pay via smartphones, few studies have explored contactless cards which are a drain on global economies due to interchange fees. Policy makers, retailing unions and global payment networks are debating the merits of fee regulations that are dependent on consumer acceptance. Hence, this study empirically measures consumer acceptance of contactless cards which informs stakeholders of their likely trajectory and highlights potential for prospective markets. Partial least squares structural equation modelling is used in conjunction with technology acceptance and risk perception theories to formulate a proposed model fit for measuring intent to use. A questionnaire is constructed using repurposed measures reflecting latent perceptions that possess demonstrated relevance in relation to contactless pay technologies. Results from 587 respondents show that acceptance is strongly influenced by perceived security, overall risk, trust and usefulness. New Zealand consumers are largely positive towards use whilst younger cohorts are the most likely to accept. The proposed model is suitable for reapplication in prospective markets which aids scholars in measuring market receptivity of contactless cards.",,,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/15112",,,"en","English",,"University of Canterbury",,,,,"http://library.canterbury.ac.nz/thesis/etheses_copyright.shtml",,"All Rights Reserved",,,,,,,,,,,"Examining the perceived risks of contactless card acceptance in the New Zealand market",,,"Electronic Thesis or Dissertation",,,"Business Administration",,"University of Canterbury",,"Masters",,,"Master of Commerce",,"2638950",,,"College of Business and Law, University of Canterbury",,,"jamesmcmillan54@gmail.com",,,,,,,,"Associate Professor Girish Prayag"

A MGT ordering is defined by two conditions. Condition a) states that MGT is ordered by the maximum potential increase in income of the recipient, or that the more you stand to receive from an offer, the more generous it is to you. Condition b) states that the increase in maximum potential income of the recipient cannot be less than the maximum potential increase in income of the proposers. In other words, Condition b) states that an offer cannot be self-serving, but it is not specified in Cox, Friedman, and Sadiraj (2008) precisely how b) affects the MGT ordering. I propose that a violation of b) is considered self-serving and is less MGT than when b) is not violated. I then experimentally study the empirical relevance of b) using two designs that hold a) constant, comparing MGT differences implied by responses. The first design is a variant of the Lost Wallet Game (Dufwenberg & Gneezy, 2000) with a negative outside option, and the second design is a modified Investment Game (Berg, Dickhaut, & McCabe, 1995) with elements of the Dictator Game implemented by Andreoni and Miller (2002).

"11312","10092/839","Webb, Rachel Susan",,,,,,,"2014",,"High birth weight (also known as macrosomia) is a problem that has as of yet received little attention by health researchers, in particular, health economists. High birth weight is a concern mostly due to the increased difficulties it presents during birth for both the mother and the baby but there is also concern that high birth weight may continue to present negative effects later in the baby’s life. Many factors have been attributed as risk factors for high birth weight including mother’s age, ethnicity, parity, obesity, weight gain during pregnancy, infant gender, and gestation length. However, there is a dearth of careful analysis dedicated to determining the extent of causality of these risk factors where endogeneity concerns are present. In this thesis, I examine various issues surrounding high birth weight. I describe the situation in New Zealand (Chapter 2) to see if our experience with high birth weight reflects that found in international research. I analyse the relationship between socio-economic status and high birth weight (Chapter 3) to explore whether high socio-economic status has a unique effect on high birth weight compared to other health disorders in which it generally helps alleviate the incidence. I further investigate the relationship between obesity and high birth weight (Chapter 4) in an attempt to disentangle the causal effect of obesity on high birth weight risk from the mere correlation that has been well documented. I explore the possibility of vitamin and mineral supplements taken during pregnancy being a risk factor for high birth weight (Chapter 5), then address the potential endogeneity issues to identify a causal impact. Finally, I return to the definition of high birth weight (Chapter 6) and consider the optimal way to define the “problematic” weight threshold and whether this threshold should depend on gestation length or the ethnicity of the mother.
My findings suggest that in New Zealand, the incidence of macrosomia varies by the ethnicity and weight group of the mother and the gender of the infant. Socio-economic status does seem to affect high birth weight risk but the nature of the relationship is complex. Obesity only appears to have a significant causal effect on high birth weight risk for women who are morbidly obese, but even for these women conventional estimation that disregards the endogeneity of obesity greatly exaggerates the effect. There does appear to be a correlation between iron supplementation and high birth weight risk but the relationship does not withstand controlling for endogeneity. My findings indicate that the currently accepted threshold used to define macrosomia is justified as it does consistently predict adverse health outcomes. However, flexible definitions which consider different grades of macrosomia or different thresholds for different ethnicities could improve on the current definition.",,,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/10088",,,"en",,,"University of Canterbury.

This research direction was informed by a thematic literature review which identified there was still no obvious solution as to how wineries should communicate their commitment to eco-friendly practices (Olsen, Thach, & Hemphil, 2012; Delmas & Grant, 2014). This poses a challenge for New Zealand wineries as the industry is 98 percent sustainably certified (New Zealand Wine, 2017a) and consumers have demonstrated a demand for this wine label attribute (Forbes, Cohen, Cullen, Wratten, & Fountain, 2009). It was proposed in literature that wine brands could adopt brand attributes that reflect the values of eco-friendly practices in order to strengthen their position in the market (Orth & Malkewitz, 2008). In order to test this suggestion, two brand personality dimensions were chosen, one from Aaker’s (1997) traditional brand personality scale, excitement, and one newly proposed dimension, social (Spielmann, Babin, & Verghote, 2016). The procedure of this research was a 3 (Social vs. Excitement vs. No Brand Personality) x 2 (Sustainable Product Description vs. No Product Description) x 2 (Sustainable Eco-Label vs. No Label) between subjects, full factorial experiment design. The online survey employed a series of twelve print advertisements designed to contain different combinations of the independent variables. The experiment was distributed via Qualtrics and employed 540 North American participants recruited via Amazon’s Mechanical Turk. A factorial ANCOVA analysis was conducted to test the hypothesised relationships. The analysis revealed that the three-way interaction effects were non-significant for the three hypothesis: H1 Purchase Intention, H2 Perception of Quality, and H3 Attitudes toward the Brand. However, Eco-Label and Brand Personality had main effects for all hypothesis. Furthermore, a two-way interaction effect was found for Eco-Label and Brand Personality on Perception of Quality. The results of this research have practical implications for the New Zealand wine industry as they demonstrate the importance of eco-labels, which are currently not employed by most New Zealand wine brands, in positively influencing Purchase Intention, Perception of Quality, and Attitudes toward the Brand. Furthermore, the results showed that the Excitement and Social Brand Personalities, which demonstrate the experiential elements of the hedonic product, also increased consumers’ Purchase Intentions, Perceptions of Quality, and Attitudes toward the Brand. This research highlights an opportunity for Sustainable Wine New Zealand to develop a sustainable eco-label which can be employed by New Zealand wineries.

"18950","10092/839","Harris, Peter J.",,,,,,,"2017",,"There is little understanding of, or information about, CAM products, their use, or multifarious issues surrounding them in New Zealand. It is therefore unsurprising that NZ has lacked effective CAM product regulation for decades. Following a review of surrounding legislation, and a preliminary investigation into CAM product prevalence and perceptions, this research proposes new legislation for the regulation of CAM products, which takes a forward-looking, evidence-based approach to succeed where numerous other proposals have failed.

CAM products are effective unregulated in New Zealand, with the Dietary Supplements Regulations 1985 being sorely outdated, and every new proposal for the past three decades failing to come to fruition. As a result, general legislation like the Fair Trading Act 1986 is used to handle misleading or deceptive conduct in relation to CAM products, although its regulation of these products is inherently limited.

The two pieces of quantitative research in this thesis consider the habits and perceptions of New Zealanders around CAM products; first studying students, and second broadening the scope to collect data from a representative sample of New Zealanders. With 80% of New Zealanders having used CAM products, and a significant number being misled by the labelling and packaging on these products, new regulations around CAM products must address these issues to protect consumers.

This thesis proposes a new piece of legislation for the risk-based regulation of CAM products in NZ. Through adaptation of regulatory models and provisions utilised in other legislation, this proposed CAM Products Bill establishes an effective risk-based approach, which categorises CAM products into three tiers, plus a black-list for prohibited ingredients or products. This is a pre-approval scheme that links the evidence, safety, and research on the CAM product, to the fee structure, indirectly encouraging industry research and development into safe, quality and effective CAM products. Additionally, this Bill proposes a sound administrative structure and effective enforcement measures which have a history of use with CAM products.

Ultimately, this proposed legislation will fill the void which currently exists around CAM product regulation in NZ, particularly following the withdrawal by the new Labour Government of the Natural Health and Supplementary Products Bill in November 2017. It also addresses systemic problems of an information deficit by incentivising research into CAM products, and regulating in a manner that promotes scientific evidence, safety, efficacy, honest information for consumers, and high-quality CAM products through soft-touch risk-based CAM product legislation.",,,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/15200",,,"en","English",,"University of Canterbury",,,,,"http://library.canterbury.ac.nz/thesis/etheses_copyright.shtml",,"All Rights Reserved",,,,,,,,,,,"The regulation of complementary and alternative medicine in New Zealand.",,,"Electronic Thesis or Dissertation",,,"Law",,"University of Canterbury",,"Masters",,,"Master of Laws",,,,,"College of Business and Law, University of Canterbury",,,"harris.peterjohn@gmail.com",,,,,,,,"Dr Debra Wilson"
"18951","10092/839","Kemper, Joya A.",,,,,,,"2017",,"Sustainability has entered the vernacular of many disciplines and marketing seems to be no
exception. However, the construct, both within and outside marketing, is still contested. Given
the growing importance of sustainability, especially in providing a possible solution to current
ecological, social, and economic issues, it is time for marketing to reflect on its role in
perpetuating unsustainability and its role in establishing a sustainable society. More importantly,
it is critically important that marketing academics reflect on how sustainability is, can, and should
be integrated in theory and taught in marketing education.

This research goes beyond previous research which has proposed how the business
school can further sustainability integration and instead focuses on the role of the individual as
an inhibitor and challenger to institutional change. Reflecting on the literature and issues present
in sustainability marketing scholarship and curriculum, two studies were conducted as part of
this thesis. Study One, through eighteen qualitative semi-structured interviews with marketing
academics interested in sustainability research and education, sought to gain an in-depth
understanding of what it means to be sustainable within marketing (e.g. through theory,
pedagogy) and why academics pursued their interest in sustainability marketing. In Study Two,
the sustainability worldviews of students and faculty were measured through an international
survey.

The findings of Study One found that participants sincerely cared about sustainability
and sustainable education, which demonstrates that Education for Sustainability (EfS), as well as
sustainability research, is heavily dependent on faculty themselves, their interpretation of
sustainability, and their passion to incorporate sustainability. The formation of a sustainability
worldview revealed various avenues by which academic participants gained a passion and
appreciation for sustainability in their personal and professional lives. These avenues included, upbringing, including parents and friends; education, including presentations, books and writing
theses; and work. This passion and sustainability interpretation resulted in various ways
marketing and sustainability were integrated in theory and in teaching sustainability marketing.

This research found that marketing departments are facing issues of inertia, with
department and college colleagues adhering to the profit maximisation paradigm (the dominant
social paradigm (DSP) or market logic), a lack of faculty who have the knowledge and skills to
teach sustainability, a focus on research goals according to the countries system at the expense of
sustainability teaching and research, and a lack of commitment in leadership towards
sustainability. These barriers exemplify the difficulty and challenge of competing institutional
demands and logics, and the prominence of the DSP in faculty and marketing department
culture. Without sustainability being seen as important by the academy, its relevance to
marketing remains elusive, as merely an add-on, as a separate course in the marketing curriculum,
and a specialisation in marketing research. It is also not seen as ‘true’ sustainability. To examine
the possible barrier the sustainability worldviews of marketing faculty and students provided, as
reflected in the interviews as well as previous research, Study Two investigated the beliefs, values
and attitudes of the marketing academic community.

Study Two contributes to academic knowledge by creating a typology of marketing
faculty and students in relation to sustainability beliefs, which can provide unique insight into the
worldviews of sustainability. Of the four faculty worldviews identified, Passionates were the
most environmentally concerned and critical of the current social and economic issues of the
world, as well as businesses and marketing’s role in these issues, and represented 25.40% of the
sample. Just under 5% of marketing faculty were described as Sceptics, who were not aware of
any social, environmental and economic issues in society, especially not environmentally
concerned, and support the status quo of economic growth, and business and marketing
practices.

Similar clusters of worldviews were found for marketing students. Believers represent
24.48% of the student sample and are consistently critical (concerned) about environmental,
economic and social sustainability issues, however they are ambivalent about technologies ability
to solve environmental problems. While Doubters, the most sceptical of sustainability issues,
represented 12.39% of the student sample, and exhibited low ecological values and were mostly
ambivalent to environmental, economic and social sustainability issues.

In sum, there were positive, supportive, holistic and broad conceptualisations of
sustainability by marketing faculty and students which may indicate that a supportive
environment exists for sustainability in marketing education and research. However, faculty and
students were sometimes ambivalent to sustainability issues in the world. Considering broad
conceptualisations of sustainability, positive attitudes, and that more than 60% of faculty (and
students) were aware and concerned about environmental, social and economic sustainability
issues, questions remain about why only limited research and teaching has been done on the
intersection between marketing and sustainability.",,,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/15199",,,"en","English",,"University of Canterbury",,,,,"http://library.canterbury.ac.nz/thesis/etheses_copyright.shtml",,"All Rights Reserved",,,,,,,,,,,"Comparing the worldviews of marketing and sustainability.",,,"Electronic Thesis or Dissertation",,,"Business Administration",,"University of Canterbury",,"Doctoral",,,"Doctor of Philosophy",,,,,"College of Business and Law, University of Canterbury",,,"joya.kemper@pg.canterbury.ac.nz",,,,,,,,"Professor Paul Ballantine"
"18968","10092/839","Ono, Mari",,,,,,,"2018",,"This research assesses the sensitivity of ratio analysis in bankruptcy prediction. I challenge the usually applied criterion in bankruptcy analysis where a model outperforms another model based on their classification performance (prediction) of firms into bankrupt and non-bankrupt categories. The commonly applied decision criterion is based on Type 1 and Type 2 errors or the aggregate predictive ability of a model. However, I claim that, say, if these metrics show identical results for two models, it is not clear by any stretch that they have the same predictive ability. Rather I contest that looking at the classification patterns of each individual firm, one may observe that indeed both models classify rightly and wrongly all firms in a testing sample; or, they do not, in which case a data-driven result has been obtained.

I have chosen to demonstrate this novel idea by means of the classification performance of the multivariate discriminant analysis (MDA) and Logit models. These two models were introduced by Altman (1968) and Ohlson (1980), respectively, and are probably the most established bankruptcy prediction tools in the literature and in business applications. In doing so, I heavily lean on Begley et al. (1996) who compare the two models using data from the 1990ies. From this starting point, I further apply criteria that allow for a fairer comparison of the two models, because testing two models about the predictive ability to classify firms into groups seems unreliable when each model uses different variables and where for neither of the two models any specification test results are considered.

My research question therefore asks whether the reported results of the MDA and Logit models in the literature with respect to bankruptcy prediction do hold when firm-specific classification patterns are considered. I provide various negative results to this question. This work and the discussed future direction that may be taken based on my work have to potential to redirect the bankruptcy literature to more useful assessments of model performance comparisons.",,,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/15246",,,"en","English",,"University of Canterbury",,,,,"http://library.canterbury.ac.nz/thesis/etheses_copyright.shtml",,"All Rights Reserved",,,,,,,,,,,"Comparing the predictive performance of the logit and discriminant analysis models in bankruptcy prediction",,,"Electronic Thesis or Dissertation",,,"Accountancy",,"University of Canterbury",,"Masters",,,"Master of Commerce",,"2644555",,,"College of Business and Law, University of Canterbury",,,"chabuu11@gmail.com",,,,,,,,"Associate Professo Michael Falta"
"8913","10092/839","Fowler, Joshua Emmanuel",,,,,,,"2013",,"Tax avoidance is an exceedingly complex area of law. It is also a matter generally found not far from the headlines, or from the concerns of state and policy forums such as the G8 and the OECD. In an increasingly capital mobile world, the concern on the part of Governments for the protection of their sources of revenue has increased. 

Adam Smith’s four canons of taxation are well known. In his work, The Wealth of Nations, Smith regarded the values of certainty, equity, efficiency and convenience as integral to the functioning of a tax system. Among these, however, Smith would seem to have regarded certainty as of particular significance. The prominence afforded to the value of certainty, in conjunction with the smaller role afforded the state likely contributed to the formalistic approach taken by the courts of the British Commonwealth to the interpretation of taxing statutes. In recent times, however, the importance of certainty among policy makers and jurists has declined. Although this is not to contend that the value of certainty has ceased to be a consideration, it would seem to have come to be regarded as a lesser value among many rather than an end in itself.

Although the optimal level of certainty within a jurisdiction is undoubtedly a matter for debate, the presence of uncertainty may carry with it a number of risks and unintended consequences which may hinder the achievement of the ends sought after by policy makers. These may include an increase in the rate of capital flight and in the use of asset sheltering devices, a decrease in the incidence of economic activity, and decreased rates of compliance among taxpayers. The value of certainty, in other words, may be of greater significance to the efficient functioning of a tax system than it has in recent times been thought to be.

In contending with tax avoidance, the countries of the British Commonwealth tend to employ either one of two instruments; a statutory General Anti-Avoidance Rule (GAAR) or a judicial doctrine; an innovation of the common law. In this thesis, the writer sets out to examine the judicial doctrine applied in the jurisdiction of the United Kingdom (UK), and the statutory GAARs deployed in Canada and New Zealand, and the respective implications of each instrument for the value of certainty. 

While the difference in the implications presented by the application of a broad judicial doctrine and a narrow GAAR may be slight, it is the writer’s contention that, all things held equal, the use of a judicial doctrine is likely to have a less deleterious effect on the value of certainty than a GAAR. Accordingly, it is the writer’s contention that the use of a judicial doctrine is for this reason be preferred.",,,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/8358",,,"en",,,"University of Canterbury.

The existing literature in this area highlights the multi-faceted nature of intuition and agrees on the importance of entrepreneurial intuition from a theoretical perspective but this study is among the first to examine this specific aspect of strategic practice empirically. This research adopts a pragmatic strategy as practice perspective to examine the use of entrepreneurial intuition and employs a longitudinal research design along with a methodology that draws on dual process theory from cognitive psychology and creative action theory from sociology.

Through the use of cognitive causal maps, seven hi-tech strategists were engaged in a two year longitudinal data collection process during which time they each sought and attempted to progress a number of strategic opportunities. Subsequent abductive analysis of the case data along with synthesis of existing models of creativity and strategic cognition has allowed for a dynamic recursive model of opportunity navigation to be proposed. This “intimation spiral” extends existing static typologies of strategic cognition and outlines the cognitive process that the strategists undertook when navigating a new opportunity, including phases of intimation, investigation, validation and incubation.

It was also found that the participant’s entrepreneurial intuition was often deployed to evaluate other people in the process. This research sheds new light on how the strategist’s confidence in themselves, their own organisation, other parties, and the external network are related through the creative actions undertaken.

The strategic timing of opportunities was also a significant area where entrepreneurial intuition was found to be deployed and a range of temporal factors were uncovered such as adoption rate, opportunity cost, reward profile, need for speed, control of timing and organisational readiness. Examining the temporal structures the strategists employed in practice, such as event time, clock time and cycle time and how these relate to the strategic issue of entrainment, or synchronisation, helps build on existing theoretical work in this area.

In addition to opening the door for further research in this area, the findings have implications for strategic practitioners in terms of helping increase metacognitive awareness, offering a means of building confidence in opportunities and highlighting different aspects of timing which may be crucial to the success of a strategic opportunity.",,,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/15202",,,"en","English",,"University of Canterbury",,,,,"http://library.canterbury.ac.nz/thesis/etheses_copyright.shtml",,"All Rights Reserved",,,,,,,,,,,"The role of entrepreneurial intuition in making sense of strategic opportunities.",,,"Electronic Thesis or Dissertation",,,"Business Administration",,"University of Canterbury",,"Doctoral",,,"Doctor of Philosophy",,,,,"College of Business and Law, University of Canterbury",,,"Christian. walsh@canterbury.ac. nz",,,,,,,,"Dr Paul Knott"

Both are characteristics that ultimately serve to not only routinely constrain the efficiency, performance and resultant productivity of the New Zealand building sector, but moreover they persist to play a part in increasing related costs whilst diminishing the quality of the built environment surrounding us. The ubiquity of the outsource model goes some way towards mitigating much of the risk and financial encumbrances that large construction companies have historically faced. But consequentially it is directly responsible for an industry now propagated mostly by small, specialist trade subcontracting organisations that for the most part are reliant upon securing work through construction companies. Contiguous to a degree is the propensity of an industry focussed upon procuring construction by means of competitive tendering, an approach whereby successful bids are traditionally weighted towards those incorporating the lowest initial cost.
To garner an understanding of the role that contextual significance plays in construction procurement this study was facilitated by utilising a constructivist grounded theoretical approach. Data was generated by the way of fifty interviews with construction industry stakeholders, inclusive of Sub-Contractors, Main Contractors, Consultants, Architects and Clients. Subsequent analysis reveals that in response to power asymmetry and other environmental conditions, organisations have developed numerous proactive, reactive and opportunistic strategies and behaviours that become evident as the procurement process progresses. This study highlights and explains the relationships and factors from which an industry actor’s rationale is drawn. Furthermore, however, it argues that the proponents of construction industry procurement will when necessary, relax their ordinarily pre-conditioned moral constraints and consciously venture into business practices considered by their peers to be somewhat immoral.",,,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/8714",,,"en",,,"University of Canterbury.

However, little work has considered contract strategy, incorporating factors such as the feedback of spot market behaviour on contract market equilibria. This thesis assesses the risk that market participants are exposed to, establishes a measure of risk, and analyses the role that forward contracts play in hedging that risk.

"10195","10092/839","Skilling, Hayden",,,,,,,"2014",,"Prior research from the U.S. and abroad reveals a sizable lesbian earnings advantage over otherwise-similar heterosexual women. Using data from the 2000 U.S. Census and 2005-2010 American Community Surveys, we estimate traditional earnings equations and find robust evidence of a lesbian premium, corroborating the findings of previous studies. Using within-sample maternity incidence as an estimate of employers' forward-looking expectations, we then examine whether differences in the perceived likelihood of an employee requiring maternity leave, here-labelled 'maternity risk', contribute to the lesbian pay gap. Results from a direct assessment suggest that maternity risk adversely affects income, and that accounting for near-term differences in maternity risk reduces the lesbian premium by approximately ten to fifteen percent. Further analyses, using proxy variables for differential maternity risk, yield similar results. As such, the persistent finding of a lesbian earnings advantage in previous studies can be attributed, at least in part, to employers' aversion to maternity risk and its associated costs.

These findings are also of critical importance to the general labour-market discrimination literature. Given the adverse earnings effect of maternity risk, our analysis suggests that estimates of the well-established gender earnings disparity are likely to be considerably smaller when incorporating maternity risk into the analysis. Absent the ability to adequately control for maternity risk, strict attention should be paid to potential upward bias in estimated earnings differentials. Moreover, policymakers should consider the broader implications of maternity-leave policy on the labour-market outcomes of females. In this respect, maternity-leave policy may influence the hiring and promotion decisions of employers, thereby indirectly affecting sexual-orientation and gender equality in the labour market. However, further research in this area is still required, given the limitations inherent in the direct and indirect analyses.",,,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/9243",,,"en",,,"University of Canterbury.

"10070","10092/839",,,"Brooks, B. T.",,,,,"1968",,"The associations examined in this study have two common characteristics: they are formed by a group of private individuals, and they have come together for some primary purpose other than profit-making. The classic form of such an association was the Eighteenth Century Club, and for the purpose of this inquiry the genre of voluntary association may be broadly defined in club terms:- “…a society of persons associated together for social intercourse? for the promotion of politics, sport, art, science or literature, or for any purpose except the acquisition of gain.”
 Commercial trading companies and business partnerships are clearly excluded. Fraternal orders, political parties, church bodies and golf-clubs equally clearly fall within the definition. The place of the trade union is more difficult to determine, but the resemblance of trade unions to social clubs has been acknowledged by New Zealand courts and it is proposed to pay particular attention to trade unions for they most clearly illustrate the broader context in which expulsion must be studied. Expulsion embraces more than mere catalogue and analysis of case-law and statute relating to voluntary associations for the legal problems involved cannot be divorced from their social, political and economic context.
 The voluntary association has been described as “an exotic in the field of litigation”,  the core problem being that such an aggregate of individuals is not recognised traditionally as having any separate legal existence. From this it follows that the association cannot enter into contracts nor sue nor be sued, and there are difficulties confronting such a group wishing to hold any real property, or, indeed, any form of tangible asset. In short, there exist a number of problems of substance and procedure in actions by and against such a group.
 Furthermore, voluntary associations have traditionally been accorded autonomy in internal affairs. The courts have long taken the view that the internal dispute of, say, a debating society or card club are not justiciable. While most internal affairs of voluntary bodies can be resolved by the rules governing co-ownership and agency, the traditional judicial approach affords little encouragement to the wrongly expelled member.
 This is so notwithstanding that expulsion “constitutes perhaps the central legal issue as regards associations of a non-commercial nature.”
 At the narrowest the question to be pursued in this study is: then a member of a voluntary association is improperly expelled, what is the nature of his remedy and against whom is it available? For the member the resolution of this issue raises problems of substance and procedure. For the courts the issue involves two problems: on what basis will the Court assume jurisdiction and, if jurisdiction is assumed, what remedies are available?
 At the widest, the theme of this study is a facet of the conflict between group and individual freedoms, which crystallise in the problem of expulsion from private associations, and which involve associated jurisprudential difficulties consequent upon rapid social change in a modern welfare state.
 Broad consideration of the relation of law to society and of legal theory to social reality will, therefore, intrude throughout.",,,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/9125",,,"en",,,"University of Canterbury.

"9989","10092/839",,,"Tennant, Vanesa Monique",,,,,"2014",,"As organizations continue to invest heavily in Information Systems (IS) to support business processes, the underutilization of such systems is a key concern that challenges efforts to exploit their benefits. What is most desirable is for users to engage in forms of deep use that effectively leverage the features of the IS for work tasks. But, too often users engage in surface-level use, minimizing their interactions with the IS. Yet for many users how they use an IS changes over time to become progressively deeper as the IS is embedded more in the performance of various tasks. 

To date there has been limited research on post-adoption IS use, particularly on how individuals choose to or are influenced to learn about, selectively adopt and apply, and then extend IS use. This research therefore seeks to bridge a gap in the literature by responding to calls for greater attention to changes in IS post-adoption use. This study draws on evolutionary theory, that is, Generalized Darwinism and its key principles of variation, selection and retention, to understand and explain how individuals’ IS use change over time, as they enact routines supported by the IS. 

Using a multi-method research design, this study includes an exploratory phase (qualitative) followed by a confirmatory phase (quantitative). For the qualitative phase, case studies were used to explore change in IS use; a cross-section of 39 users (i.e. basic, intermediate and advanced) of large-scale IS (e.g. CRM) from across three (3) organizations were interviewed. The findings from the qualitative phase coupled Generalized Darwinism principles of variation, selection and retention, supporting theories (e.g. motivation theory) and prior research in IS, were used to develop a conceptual model that framed changes in post-adoption use for further analysis. The model was then tested using data collected from a field survey (86 users) and analyzed using the Partial Least Squares (PLS) approach to structural equation modeling.

The study showed that variations occur as individuals used formerly unused (available) features, modified use of currently used sets of features, substituted or replaced one (already-used) feature with another feature and found novel or innovative uses of IS features. There were also a number of similarities in the findings from the case study and the survey regarding the triggers and enablers of variations and the impact of variations on retention, and in turn the impact of retention on deeper use via emergent use, integrative use and extended use. Both the case studies and the survey confirmed the importance of feedback valence, intrinsic motivation, and domain-related knowledge and of key sub-dimensions such as intrinsic motivation to learn, knowledge of IS features and work process understanding as triggers of variations. Satisfaction, in addition to variations was also instrumental in determining which variants in use were selected and incorporated into one’s work routine (retention). 

Furthermore, the results suggest that as changes occurred over time, such changes resulted in more deeply ingrained use behaviours, by way of infusion. At the same time, some differences were observed among the case studies and between the case study outcomes and the survey findings, with some of the factors identified as important in the case findings, such as peer learning, extrinsic motivation, and perceived (IS) resources, not being significant as predictors of variations in the survey context. 
Overall, the findings on changes in IS use and factors involved provided insights into how change occurs via variation, selection and retention and the outcome of the change (i.e. deeper use). It is anticipated that the findings of this research will contribute to the post-adoption IS use literature and provide useful insights for managers as they tackle the problem of IS underutilization.",,,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/9031",,,"en",,,"University of Canterbury.

"19141","10092/839",,"O’Neill, Padriac",,,,,,"2018",,"Since its inception at Motorola during the late 1980s Six Sigma has steadily risen in popularity and reputation as a worldwide standard for manufacturing quality through its objective of increasing quality through the decrease of variance. Six Sigma now boasts a wide variety of tools and processes that seek to improve quality, increase financial returns, improve customer satisfaction rates, reduce rework and waste. At its core Six Sigma follows the stepwise procedure of the DMAIC (Design, Measure, Analyse, Improve and Control) methodology.

This research sought to investigate and identify the success factors that are present during a Six Sigma project, for the reason that identifying and understanding these factors will provide practitioners with the knowledge to ensure that their Six Sigma Project has a higher chance of success. To achieve this a two stage approach was adopted. Stage One consisted of a systematic literature review of current and relevant literature in the Six Sigma and Business Improvement field. A systematic review was chosen for its ability to condense large amounts of information allowing the researcher to establish and recognise consistent information across sources of literature. Stage Two of this research consisted of an empirical analysis to identify success factors by conducting a single case study in an organisation applying Six Sigma through a series of semi-structured interviews. This approach is classified as an embedded single case design as it involves multiple units of analysis.

The framework applied to the Systematic Literature review was the Preferred Reporting Items of Systematic Reviews (PRISMA) and Meta-Analyses. This was to ensure a systematic and recordable process of literature search, exclusion and analysis. In Stage Two of the research, the semi-structured interviews (N=10) were transcribed then hand coded for analysis. Semi structured interviews were chosen for their capacity to allow the researcher to prepare questions in advance, while still allowing the conversation to flow naturally and in a relaxed setting. Subsequently the findings from both stages of the study were collated and compared. This provided a series of success factors which have both real world and literature evidence to corroborate and support their existence.

Success factors identified from the systematic literature review included the importance of project structure, efficient resource allocation, importance of accurate measurement systems, levels of knowledge/experience, levels of training provided to project members and the commitment level of senior managers and project members. Analysis of the semi-structured interviews provided real world evidence that substantiated the theories and claims uncovered during the systematic literature review.

The major finding from the analysis was the discovery of a success factor that was not described or discovered during the systematic literature review. This success factor is termed acceptance and refers to how the level employee ‘acceptance’ for Six Sigma projects had a strong effect on the success of the project.

To the extent of the researcher’s knowledge this is the first investigation into success factors of a Six Sigma project within a New Zealand organisation/business. The findings from this study contribute to both the academic literature and managerial practices (i.e. operations management), by providing empirical evidence supporting theories surrounding project successes that were identified during the systematic literature review.

The findings suggest a series of success factors. These success factors are commitment of senior management, measurement accuracy, importance of project structure, knowledge/experience, resource allocation, and training for the employee’s level. In addition to these success factors found in both the systematic literature review and in the interviews, there was a significant finding from the Case Study Organisation that was not found in the literature. This finding is new success factor - ‘employee acceptance’. All of these success factors Business Improvement specialists can focus on and cultivate within their organisations, with the aim of increasing project success rates and, moreover, creating increased business growth.",,,,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/15515",,"en","English",,"University of Canterbury",,,,,"http://library.canterbury.ac.nz/thesis/etheses_copyright.shtml",,"All Rights Reserved",,,,,,,,,,,"An exploratory case study analysis of implementation of six sigma in a New Zealand organisation.",,,"Electronic Thesis or Dissertation",,,"Business Administration",,"University of Canterbury",,"Masters",,,"Master of Commerce",,"2665091",,,"College of Business and Law, University of Canterbury",,,"Padriac.wf.oneill@gmail.com",,,,,,,,"Dr. Venkateswarlu Pulakanam"

Provincial data was collected from the Statistics New Zealand Annual Reports and New Zealand Census. Anthropometric data was derived from the personnel records of New Zealanders serving in WWI, which only became available to the public in 2005. Time-series tests for convergence and causality have been applied to analyze New Zealand’s economic history, where appropriate. 
The last quarter of the 19th century in New Zealand was a period of rapid change both in terms of economic and demographic indicators. Prior to the universal convergence of the existing monetary-based measures of wellbeing across Provinces, there were some apparent disparities in the commodity price and real wage series, as well as urban-rural differences in occupation-specific real wages and infant mortality trends. There was also no single pattern of stature decline across provinces during 1871-1898, or between urban and rural areas, where disparities were particularly apparent. The traditional view of the healthy and wealthy New Zealand could only be established at an aggregate level, during a certain time period and for a certain ethnic group (New Zealand European only).
Using Provincial data for the period 1874-1919 I have been able to show that improvements in real wages and a decrease in education inequality (between females and males) corresponded to lower infant deaths and thus better health outcomes, while increased dwelling density created unfavorable conditions for infants’ chances of survival. Anthropometric data was used in conjunction with socio-economic provincial data to establish the relationship between stature, urbanization, real wages and infant mortality. The results showed that dwelling density (overcrowding) and general economic conditions were both important in determining stature outcomes during 1870-1900, while the effect of infant mortality on stature was negligible. Most importantly, it has been demonstrated that in New Zealand stature represents a much more robust measure of living standards than real wages or health indicators on their own, at least during the 1870-1900 period.",,,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/9221",,,"en",,,"University of Canterbury.

McBarnet et al's (1993) research and a pilot case study indicated otherwise. The pilot study also found that employees had access to the informal communication network, or grapevine, and an informal accounting information system (IAIS). McBarnet et al (1993) report that informal information may assist employees to detect problems or unusual events within a company. Consequently, this research sought to clarify the anomaly between Argenti's assertions and McBarnet et al's (1993) and the pilot study's findings, determining the problems or concerns that employees observed in a company before. it collapsed, and whether these observations could cause employees to believe that a company was distressed before it failed. The research also examined whether information from an IAIS and/or the grapevine contributes to employees' observations and opinions in a distressed company.
 A single case study of a failed organisation was conducted. The subject was Fortex
 Group Limited, a South Island meat-processing company. The findings challenged and extended previous beliefs regarding employees' observations in a distressed company, indicating that they may not only observe the symptoms of distress, but also observe the defects and mistakes which cause, and contribute to, failure. Moreover, from the symptoms observed, the employees recognised that the company was distressed. The research also established preliminary links between the grapevine, IAISs, employees' observations and corporate distress. Each area was identified as an alternative source of information which could potentially assist the early detection of corporate distress.
 Despite limitations, this research increases the body of knowledge in these areas, and recommends directions for future research.",,,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/10439",,,"en",,,"University of Canterbury.

"10510","10092/839","Gunatilake, Gayathri",,,,,,,"2014",,"In this thesis I explain change in accounting practices and organisations as a construction of the observer. My case study demonstrates how observers construct different static entities and observe change of those constructed entities, and why individuals perceive change differently. These are some key issues raised by past researchers of accounting change that require further examination and fuller explanation.
A belief in a reality, assumption of a linear evolution over time and space, and reductionism are common assumptions in extant studies on change. These factors lead to difficulties in understanding what change is and why individuals perceive change differently. In contrast, this study uses the concept of impermanence from Buddhist philosophy, which assumes that everything that one perceives as existing is a construction of the observer, owing to limitations in perceiving the continual process of emergence and decline of all things. Using this concept, I demonstrate that what we observe as change in accounting practices is the difference in the properties of the static entities constructed by individuals due to delays in observing or inability to observe all instantaneous changes of a given aspect. As individuals’ constructions are subject to their personal knowledge, interests, and experiences, constructions differ from one observer to another. As individuals observe changes relative to the properties of their own constructions, they perceive change in accounting practices differently and act accordingly.
A longitudinal case study method is adopted as it supports the researcher’s methodological assumptions. Empirical materials were gathered on change in a telecommunications organisation in Sri Lanka. Interviews and document review were used as the major methods of collecting empirical evidence to construct my knowledge about Sri Lanka Telecom, its context and accounting practices.
This study introduces a new perspective to the current literature in order to explain change in organisations and accounting practices. It answers questions that remained open in relation to change in accounting practices. I suggest that further research using the concepts introduced in this study would benefit the discipline, particularly in relation to implications of changing accounting practices in organisations.",,,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/9562",,,"en",,,"University of Canterbury.

These changes are leading to higher economic growth and consequent impacts on the health conditions of the country. Health can be regarded as an addition to economic growth models. There has been a widespread development in the health economics discipline. However, the research on the impact of health on economic growth has been concentrated mostly in developed and developing economies, but there has been marked neglect of small open economies. This study aims to focus on the Island Kingdom of Tonga - a small open economy and a country that falls within the upper middle income category (World Bank, 2012). The study seeks to verify empirically the impact of health on the economic performance of the country. The analysis is based on time series data, the econometric techniques of single, autoregressive distributed lag model (ARDL) and the multiple equations framework, vector error correction method (VECM).
The study found that there have been substantial impacts of health indicators (life expectancy, infant mortality and fertility rate) on the Tongan economy. A positive effect in terms of life ex-pectancy on economic growth led to an improvement of economic activity through additional years of longevity of the working age population. The dynamic, innovative technique also indi-cated a uni-directional causality between economic growth and life expectancy variable. The long run causality however, runs mainly from life expectancy to economic growth rather than in the opposite direction. A negative impact was found in the second health indicator (infant mortality) with uni-directional causality running from higher economic growth that may reduce  the infant mortality rate. Finally, the fertility rate found a negative impact on economic growth in the long run with no Granger causality among the variables.
Amongst those frameworks, the ARDL and VECM suggest that in such a small developing coun-try the quantitative impacts are also a novel and important approach in Tonga  and may result in a significant impact on the economy for the next decade. The policy implication is that maintaining good health through higher life expectancy is associated with a positive impact on economic growth and this can also channel to other innovations, technological contributions to the country at large.",,,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/9564",,,"en",,,"University of Canterbury.

"10780","10092/839",,,"Baker, Gregory Douglas Ansell",,,,,"2014",,"A fundamental process in many important research foci in information systems is the appropriation of IT artifacts in creative ways by users. The objective of this thesis is to develop a theoretical explanation of that process. 
An embedded multiple-case study of incidents in which users, in a variety of field settings, developed creative ways to apply IT artifacts, was conducted. Employing theoretical lenses drawn from cognitive science (dual-process theory, distributed cognition), and Markus and Silver’s (2008) variant of adaptive structuration theory, a novel theoretical framework was developed to analyze the data. This framework – Affordance Field Theory – was used to abstract away the context-specific details of each case, so that the events in each could be compared and analyzed using a common conceptual vocabulary.
Applying critical realist assumptions, the initial retroductive analysis was done with narrative networks, then the cases were re-analyzed using framework matrices. The complementary logical forms (processual and thematic, respectively) of the analytic tools helped to provide empirical corroboration of the findings. A set of cognitive mechanisms was identified that describe the information-processing operations involved in creative user appropriation. Using assumptions from distributed cognition, it was demonstrated that these mechanisms can describe those operations at the individual and collective levels. An integrative model which shows how the mechanisms explain user creativity at the individual level was then developed. It is called the Information Cycle Model of creativity.
This thesis makes several contributions to knowledge. It develops a theoretical framework for analyzing interactions between users and systems that is designed to represent the cycles of ideation and enactment through which creative appropriation moves are developed. It also presents a model of the cognitive mechanisms involved in the discovery of novel appropriation moves. The thesis also contributes to current debates within IS about representational metaphors for user interaction with IT.",,,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/9742",,,"en",,,"University of Canterbury.

"10945","10092/839","Le Nguyen, Chat",,,,,,,"2014",,"In recent decades, the international community has made a concerted effort to develop the international Anti-Money Laundering Standards (AMLSs) and enhance their implementation at a national level. It is submitted that the AMLSs serve various laudable aims and States should adequately implement those standards. In fact, most States, including Vietnam, have been striving for the highest level of compliance with the AMLSs. This thesis suggests that external pressure and State socialization has compelled developing States to implement and comply with the international AMLSs, and Vietnam is an obvious case study. 
This thesis examines concisely the development and underlying rationales of a number of key categories of international AMLSs, and the difference in national implementation of each category. The implementation of such multifaceted standards in a transitional State, like Vietnam, requires substantial legal and administrative reform, which often faces numerous domestic hurdles. The examination of Vietnamese AML legislation has revealed that while significant deficiencies remain, certain categories of AMLSs have been transformed wholesale into Vietnamese law. As a part of the objectives of this study, suggestions for law reform have been made to close the gaps between the AML laws of Vietnam and the international standards. It is likely that Vietnam, within a short time, will revise the laws in order to obtain a better degree of compliance. However, given the political, economic and legal factors of Vietnam, this thesis argues that the enforcement of the laws in practice will be still limited. In other words, in the near future Vietnam can achieve what appears to be a high level of compliance with the international AMLSs, but only on paper.",,,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/9827",,,"en",,,"University of Canterbury.

"11465","10092/839","Starkey, Stephen Robert",,,,,,,"2014",,"This thesis first develops a range of wholesale water market design options, based on an optimisation approach to market-clearing, as in electricity markets, focusing on the extent to which uncertainty is accounted for in bidding, market-clearing and contract formation.  We conclude that the most promising option is bidding for, and trading, a combination of fixed and proportionally scaled contract volumes, which are based on optimised outputs.  Other options include those which are based on a post-clearing fit (e.g.  regression) to the natural optimised outputs, or constraining the optimisation such that cleared allocations are in the contractual form required by participants.  Alternatively, participants could rely on financial markets to trade instruments, but informed by a centralised market-clearing simulation.  

We then describe a computational modelling system, using Stochastic Constructive Dynamic Programming (CDDP), and use it to assess the importance of modelling uncertainty, and correlations, in reservoir optimisation and/or market-clearing, under a wide range of physical and economic assumptions, with or without a market. We discuss a number of bases of comparison, but focus on the benefit gain achieved as a proportion of the perfectly competitive market value (price times quantity), calculated using the market clearing price from Markov Chain optimisation.  With inflow and demand completely out of phase, high inflow seasonality and volatility, and a constant elasticity of -0.5, the greatest contribution of stochastic (Markov) optimisation, as a proportion of market value was 29%, when storage capacity was only 25% of mean monthly inflow, and with effectively unlimited release capacity.  This proportional gain fell only slowly for higher storage capacities, but nearly halved for lower release capacities, around the mean monthly inflow, mainly because highly constrained systems produce high prices, and hence raise market value.  The highest absolute gain was actually when release capacity was only 75% of mean monthly inflow. On average, over a storage capacity range from 2% to 1200%, and release capacity range from 100% to 400%, times the mean monthly inflow, the gains from using Markov Chain and Stochastic Independent optimisation, rather than deterministic optimisation, were 18% and 13% of market value, respectively.  

As expected, the gains from stochastic optimisation rose rapidly for lower elasticities, and when vertical steps were added to the demand curve.  But  they became nearly negligible when (the absolute value of) elasticity rose to 0.75 and beyond, inflow was in-phase with demand, or the range of either seasonal variation or intra-month variability reduced to ±50% of the mean monthly inflow.   Still, our results indicate that there are a wide range of reservoir and economic systems where accounting for uncertainty directly in the water allocation process could result in significant gains, whether  in a centrally controlled or  market context.  Price and price risk, which affect individual participants, were significantly more sensitive.  Our hope is that this work helps inform parties who are considering enhancing their water allocation practices with improved stochastic optimisation, and potentially market based mechanisms.",,,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/10205",,,"en",,,"University of Canterbury.

In the latter part of the first decade of the 21st Century Somalia was again in the global headlines, but this time associated with acts of piracy committed off its coastline.
Behind these headlines lay a complex mixture of problems stretching back as far as the early colonisation of the lands that became Somalia and populated with western European concepts ill suited to the peoples of those lands. The loss of effective government opened the door to neo colonial issues of illegal fishing and hazardous waste dumping that contributed to the piracy problem. Finely interwoven amongst all these issues runs a thread of international law.
This thesis examines that thread as it runs through the concept of state failure and asks if it is a legal term and what legal consequences, if any, are attached to it. It examines the international legal frameworks that support fishing and hazardous waste dumping and seeks to understand why they have not prevented illegal fishing and the illegal dumping of hazardous waste off the coast of Somalia.
This thesis then examines the concept of piracy as applied to Somalian pirates and seeks answers to questions as to what it is and how it has been applied. It looks at the use of private security as a response and seeks to find the legitimation for their actions in relation to pirates.

"11892","10092/839","Doyle, James Lawrence",,,,,,,"1996",,"There is no generally accepted accounting practice for infrastructural assets with respect to either their definition or how to account for them. Renewal accounting is an alternative to the generally accepted basis of accounting for fixed assets-traditional depreciation. It assumes that infrastructural networks have indefinite useful lives. Expenditure on maintenance is expensed and no depreciation is charged, provided the network's service potential is maintained. This thesis examines recent developments in accounting for infrastructural assets in New Zealand local government. A survey, comprising 18 senior managers from within 12local authorities, was undertaken with the aim of ascertaining accounting practices and gaining their views on key issues identified from the literature. The survey found that local government managers perceive asset management planning to be very important. Consequently, there is a concerted effort toward collecting information on infrastructural assets and developing asset management plans (AMPs). Developments in these areas will improve both the reliability of information for internal management purposes and for general purpose financial reporting, whether under renewal accounting or traditional depreciation.
 It is concluded from the study that infrastructural assets should be defined as a conceptually distinct group which have the characteristics of networks with indefinite useful lives. The study also revealed that renewal accounting has widespread acceptance within New Zealand local government and is, arguably, the preferred alternative for infrastructural assets. This is because it contributes to better asset management; it makes maintenance and deferred maintenance on infrastructure transparent; and it supports the democratic process, where levels of service in AMPs are agreed in consultation with the public.
 Following the direction suggested by the interviewees' views canvassed in this thesis, the next stage requires the development of a financial reporting standard which addresses renewal accounting and the circumstances under which it should be applied.",,,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/10428",,,"en",,,"University of Canterbury.

"8898","10092/839",,"Jone, Melinda",,,,,,"2013",,"The current New Zealand tax disputes resolution procedures were enacted in 1996 following a recommendation made by the Organisational Review Committee of the Inland Revenue Department in 1994. Yet, following their enactment and despite a number of positive aspects to the disputes resolution procedures, commentators and professional bodies alike have continued to raise concerns that inefficiencies, particularly with respect to time and cost, are affecting their operation and are, consequently, adversely impacting on taxpayers’ perceptions of the fairness of the procedures. It is believed that this is potentially negatively impacting on the tax system and on taxpayer voluntary compliance. Consequently, suggestions have been made for the use of alternative disputes resolution procedures, such as mediation, as another method to resolve tax disputes.

The objective of this study is to develop a refined tax mediation regime for New Zealand through improving the features of the proposed tax mediation regime for New Zealand’s tax disputes resolution system first developed by Jone and Maples (2012b). Utilising a sequential mixed methods approach, consisting of a quantitative survey questionnaire followed by a qualitative focus group interview, this study seeks feedback on Jone and Maples’ (2012b) proposed New Zealand tax mediation regime from purposively selected practitioners (experts) in the tax disputes resolution and mediation fields. The feedback obtained is used in refining Jone and Maples’ (2012b) proposed tax mediation regime.

This study finds that the most important aspect of the refined proposed regime is the inclusion of a mediator who is independent of both parties and moreover, that the mediator is foremost trained and qualified in mediation as opposed to being a specialist in tax law. The findings also indicate that mediation should not be made a mandatory phase of the disputes procedures. This study recommends that the refined tax mediation regime should be an administrative phase and incorporated with the existing conference phase in a proposed ‘ADR stage’ of the disputes procedures. Notwithstanding the potential budgetary and resource constraints, the findings indicate that if mediation were to be provided as a cost-free service, taxpayers (particularly small taxpayers) should be appreciative of the opportunity to put their cases forward and be heard, even if an agreement has not been reached through mediation. The literature suggests that this should in turn enhance taxpayers’ perceptions of fairness of the disputes procedures and thereby voluntary compliance. This study provides a foundation for the further development of tax mediation in New Zealand.",,,,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/8195",,"en",,,"University of Canterbury.

These schemes bring together iwi and the Crown to facilitate various environmental objectives. These arrangements often utilise the tenants of tikanga Māori, in particular the concept of kaitiakitanga, and are generally provided for outside of the Resource Management Act 1991. This thesis shows how two iwi, Ngāi Tahu of the South Island, and Ngāi Tūhoe of Te Urewera in the central North Island, are utilising such schemes to promote the interests of their people. It explains that Ngāi Tahu have built up co-governance in a patchwork manner, utilising the provisions of their settlement to build three distinct co-management arrangements in Canterbury. The thesis shows that Ngāi Tahu have yet to gain full co-governance capacity, but may well have a future role at the table in regional Canterbury governance from 2016 onwards. In comparison, Ngāi Tūhoe have been granted a different kind of governance arrangement that arguably goes beyond co-governance. This governance arrangement is based off the fact that legal personality has been granted to Te Urewera, and will allow Ngāi Tūhoe to promote the interests of their people in a unique way. The thesis will show that the face of co-governance is changing, and the future face of such arrangements may well give iwi more control.

Multiple regression analysis revealed that conscientiousness, secure attachment, commitment to ethnic identity, low perceived discrimination, easy access to academic activities with host students significantly protected Chinese students from experiencing cultural identity conflict, whereas preoccupied and fearful attachment, assimilation strategy increased the risk of identity conflict. Additionally, Alternation between cultural demands as one of variations of integration strategy was surprisingly found to exacerbate identity conflict and led to lower levels of intercultural sensitivity, while the other variation, blending strategy significantly resulted in greater intercultural sensitivity.

"12589","10092/839","Surovaya, Ekaterina",,,,,,,"2015",,"Over the past decade, the networked information environment has increased consumers’ autonomy and brought radical change to the advertising industry. Now individual consumers can reach millions of others around the world and advise them on well-known brands through home-produced video-ads, which was not as accessible in a previous era dominated by one-way marketing. The overall objective of this thesis was to examine the attitudinal, behavioural and recall effects of consumer-generated advertising (CGA) on viewing audiences. This was achieved by implementing an exploratory sequential mixed method design. During an initial qualitative phase with focus groups, seven determinants of CGA effectiveness were identified: recognition of consumer-generated advertising; advertising quality; product involvement; perceived expertise of ad creators; motivations of ad creators; scepticism towards CGA; and consumer’s creativity. The Salience-Involvement model of CGA effects was then developed and tested in two subsequent empirical studies. Study One used a 2 x 2, between-subjects experimental design in which levels of advertising Source Salience (consumer-generated vs. company-generated) and Product Involvement (low vs. high involvement) were manipulated. Results reveal a largely negative impact of salient CGA when the consumer source was not disclosed. However, under high involvement conditions, amateur CGA was more entertaining and more likely to be electronically shared with others. Meanwhile, under low involvement, brands from consumer-generated ads showed higher levels of recall. Study Two investigated how the outcomes of professional and amateur CGA change after source disclosure using a 3 x 2 x 2, between-subjects design. In this experiment, levels of Source Awareness (consumer-generated ads vs. company ads vs. no source indicated) were manipulated in addition to Source Salience and Product Involvement. Findings show that Source Awareness produces an interactive effect with Source Salience and Product Involvement, which is significant only on the Cognitive component of Attitude towards the ad and the Attractiveness component of Credibility. Thus, disclosure of consumer source is likely to enhance ad evaluations when the CGA is professionally produced and involvement is low. Meanwhile, attribution of amateur CGA to consumer source is likely to have a negative impact. Conversely, attribution of an amateur ad to company source has a favourable attitudinal effect under high involvement. In summary, this research demonstrates that in the context of CGA, the communicator-receiver similarity does not necessarily guarantee a positive response.

Individuals may postpone or procrastinate making a donation, and then forget about doing so due to inattention. This behavioural problem is called inertia. In other contexts, deadlines are a useful tool to prevent inertia. I examine their use in the context of charitable giving using a dictator game where the recipient is a local charity. Participants are either constrained by a one week deadline, a two week deadline, or no deadline. I find no statistically significant evidence of an inertia effect in charitable giving. Furthermore, I find no evidence that the use of a deadline increases the number of donations, or the average donation of participants. The length of the deadline does not change this result. Examining positive donations, there is a significantly higher average donation with the use of a two week deadline compared to no deadline, but this result does not carry through to other comparisons.

"12880","10092/839",,,"Palmer, Craig Derick",,,,,"1994",,"The main focus of this thesis was to learn about the individual investor and their view of dividends. It set out to investigate whether private investors regard dividends as
 important (to themselves personally or as a signal of the company's performance) and
 also how dividends impact upon a company's value. The subject group is one which has
 been neglected by previous finance research as very little is known about their
 demographics and investing practices.
 Five major areas of dividend research were examined. These were: do investors believe
 that dividends affect the value of the share, how they prefer to obtain their income from
 shares, the reasons for dividend increases and decreases, whether dividend changes
 (increases and decreases) occur for different reasons and whether an age clientele effect
 exists. Most of these problems have been investigated previously by other researchers,
 but few have used individual investors to analyse these areas.
 A survey of 280 private investors tested these questions and concluded that private
 investors believe that dividends do affect the value of a share, dividends were perceived
 to be a safer form of income (but capital gains is preferred), that dividend increases and
 decreases occur because of different reasons (mostly related to profitability or liquidity)
 and that an age clientele does exist. Most significantly, this analysis revealed that
 investors behave in a way best described by Lintner's view of dividend policy, as they:
 prefer higher dividends to lower dividends, believe dividends are a safer form of
 income and believe that dividends affect the value of a share.",,,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/11081",,,"en",,,"University of Canterbury.

"12720","10092/839","Oakley, Florence",,,,,,,"2015",,"This thesis aimed to investigate generational differences in the frequency and importance of meaningful work in employees based on the 7 facets of the Map of Meaning. Hypotheses were tested through Analysis of Variance of secondary data. 395 participants self-reported levels of meaningful work on the Comprehensive Meaningful Work Scale. Results indicated that Generation Y had significantly lower levels of meaningful work. Generation Y had significantly lower levels of Unity (importance), Serving (frequency and importance), Expressing full potential (frequency), Reality (frequency and importance) and Inspiration (frequency). Significant differences occurred mainly between Generation Y and Baby boomers, with some significant differences between Generation Y and Generation X and no significant differences between Generation X and Baby boomers. Results showed that overall frequency and importance levels were significantly lower for Generation Y. Overall frequency levels were lower than overall importance levels, which suggests that employees’ desire for meaningful work may not be satisfied. In light of this evidence, it is suggested that to improve organisational outcomes such as engagement, retention and performance, managers should provide opportunities for employees to engage in meaningful work with particular focus on Generation Y. Employees themselves should take responsibility to find meaning in their own work and life because engagement in meaningful activities can lead to satisfaction, belonging, fulfilment and a better understanding of one’s purpose in life.",,,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/10931",,,"en",,,"University of Canterbury.

"11507","10092/839","Dunn, Alexander Hiram",,,,,,,"2015",,"New Zealand faces a range of food safety hazards. Microbial hazards alone were estimated to cause over 2,000 years of lost healthy life in 2011 (Cressey, 2012) and $62m in medical costs and lost productivity in 2009 (Gadiel & Abelson, 2010). 

Chemical hazards are thought to be well managed through existing controls (Vannoort & Thomson, 2009) whereas microbial hazards are considered harder to control, primarily due to their ability to reproduce along the food production chain. Microbial hazards are thought to cause the majority of acute foodborne gastroenteritis.
 
This research reviewed food safety literature and official documentation, and conducted 55 interviews, mostly with food safety experts from different stakeholder groups, to examine the food safety decision-making environment in New Zealand. This research explores the concept of the ‘stakeholder’ in the context of food safety decision-making and proposes an inclusive ‘stakeholder’ definition as any group which is able to affect, or be affected by, the decision-making process. Utilising this definition, and guided by interviews, New Zealand stakeholders in food safety decision-making were identified and classified as follows: 
•Regulators
•Public health authorities
•Food safety scientists/academics
•Consumers
•Māori
•Food Businesses (further classified as):
o	Farmers
o 	Processors
o	Food retailers
o	Exporters

Interviews with stakeholders from these groups  highlighted twelve criteria as being relevant to multiple groups during food safety intervention evaluation:
•Effectiveness
•Financial cost
•Market Access
•Consumer Perceptions
•Ease of Implementation
•Quality or Suitability
•Quality of Science
•Equity of Costs
•Equity of Benefits
•Workplace Safety
•Cultural Impact
•Animal Welfare

There are a number of different ways to measure or assess performance on these criteria. Some are able to be quantitatively measured, while others may require the use of value judgements. This thesis used the Disability-Adjusted Life Year (DALY) metric for quantifying effectiveness during the testing of different MCDA models.

This thesis reviews the MCDA process and the food safety specific MCDA literature. There are different ways of conducting MCDA. In particular, there are a large number of models available for the aggregation phase; the process of converting model inputs, in the form of criteria scores and weights, into model recommendations. This thesis has described and reviewed the main classes of model.
 
The literature review and interview process guided the construction and testing of three classes of MCDA model; the Weighted Sum, Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) and PROMETHEE models. These models were selected due to their having different characteristics and degrees of complexity, as well as their popularity in the food safety and Health Technology Assessment (HTA) literature. Models were tested on the problem of selecting the most appropriate intervention to address the historic Campylobacter in poultry problem in New Zealand during the mid-2000s. Experimentation was conducted on these models to explore how different configurations utilise data and produce model outputs. This experimentation included:
•Varying the format of input data 
•Exploring the effects of including/excluding criteria
•Methods for sensitivity analysis 
•Exploring how data inputs and outputs can be elicited and presented using visual tools 
•	Creating and using hybrid MCDA models
The results of this testing are a key output of this thesis and provide insight into how such models might be used in food safety decision-making. The conclusions reached throughout this research phase can be classified into one of two broad groups:
•Those relating to MCDA as a holistic process/methodology for decision-making
•Those relating to the specific models and mathematical procedures for generating numerical inputs and outputs

This thesis demonstrates that food-safety decision-making is a true multi-criteria, multi-stakeholder problem. The different stakeholders in food-safety decision-making do not always agree on the value and importance of the attributes used to evaluate competing intervention schemes. MCDA is well suited to cope with such complexity as it provides a structured methodology for the systematic and explicit identification, recording and aggregation of qualitative and quantitative information, gathered from a number of different sources, with the output able to serve as a basis for decision-making. 

The MCDA models studied in this thesis range from models that are simple and quick to construct and use, to more time consuming models with sophisticated algorithms. The type of model used for MCDA, the way these models are configured and the way inputs are generated or elicited can have a significant impact on the results of an analysis. This thesis has identified a number of key methodological considerations for those looking to employ one of the many available MCDA models. These considerations include: 
•Whether a model can accommodate the type and format of input data
•The desired degree of compensation between criteria (i.e. full, partial or no compensation)
•Whether the goal of an analysis is the identification of a ‘best’ option(s), or the facilitation of discussion, and communication of data
•The degree of transparency required from a model and whether an easily understood audit trail is desired/required
•The desired output of a model (e.g. complete or partial ranking).
This thesis has also identified a number of practical considerations when selecting which model to use in food safety decision-making. These include:
•The amount of time and energy required of stakeholders in the generation of data inputs (elicitation burden)
•The degree of training required for participants
•How data inputs are to be elicited and aggregated in different group decision-making environments
•The availability of MCDA software for assisting an analysis

Considering the above points will assist users in selecting a suitable MCDA model that meets their requirements and constraints. 
This thesis provides original and practical knowledge to assist groups or individuals looking to employ MCDA in the context of food-safety intervention decision-making. This research could also serve as a guide for those looking to evaluate a different selection of MCDA models.",,,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/10243",,,"en",,,"University of Canterbury.

The paper is concerned with the ranking of academic journal quality and research impact using a survey of experts from a national project on ranking academic finance journals. A comparison is made with publicly available bibliometric data, namely the Thomson Reuters ISI Web of Science citations database (hereafter ISI) for the Business - Finance category. The paper analyses the leading international journals in Finance using expert scores and quantifiable Research Assessment Measures (RAMs), and highlights the similarities and differences in the expert scores and alternative RAMs, where the RAMs are based on alternative transformations of citations taken from the ISI database. Alternative RAMs may be calculated annually or updated daily to answer the perennial questions as to When, Where and How (frequently) published papers are cited (see Chang et al. (2011a, b, c)). The RAMs include the most widely used RAM, namely the classic 2-year impact factor including journal self citations (2YIF), 2-year impact factor excluding journal self citations (2YIF*), 5-year impact factor including journal self citations (5YIF), Immediacy (or zero-year impact factor (0YIF)), Eigenfactor, Article Influence, C3PO (Citation Performance Per Paper Online), h-index, PIBETA (Papers Ignored - By Even The Authors), 2-year Self-citation Threshold Approval

As data are not available for 5YIF, Article Influence and CAI for 13 of the leading 34 journals considered, 10 RAMs are analysed for 21 highly-cited journals in Finance. Harmonic mean rankings of the 10 RAMs for the 34 highly-cited journals are also presented. It is shown that emphasizing the 2-year impact factor of a journal, which partly answers the question as to When published papers are cited, to the exclusion of other informative RAMs, which answer Where and How (frequently) published papers are cited, can lead to a distorted evaluation of journal impact and influence relative to the Harmonic Mean rankings. A simple regression model is used to predict expert scores on the basis of RAMs that capture journal impact, journal policy, the number of high quality papers, and quantitative information about a journal.","RePEc Working Paper Series: 02/2012",,,"Chang, C-L., McAleer, M.

Working paper version of submission to Wolfram Demonstration project MArch 12 2010

The Wolfram Demonstartion project is a vehicle for a new form of academic and quantitative publications that uses modern computational software and the worldwide web as the means of an interactive dynamic publications. In principle it is a much more powerful mode of academic publishing than static written text, especially for quantitative sciences where modellling and dynamic simulation and alternative models and simulations are important for both theory and empirical work. 

The Wolfram Site
http://demonstrations.wolfram.com/FAQ.html
 answers many questions about the publications it contains. Two important questions for the academic QA process , and their answer, are reproduced here: 


Is there a review process for Demonstrations?
Yes. Each Demonstration's content is rigorously reviewed by experts in relevant fields, and automated software-quality-assurance methods are used to check its operation.

Do Demonstrations count as academic publications?
Yes. Every Demonstration undergoes a rigorous review process that checks for quality, clarity, and accuracy, so you can count them as academic publications.

If those responsible for the QA process are in anyway skeptical about these claims I am more than happy to show them the to and fro process with editors and reviewers that has been characteristic of my (our) publications there.",,,"Fountain, J., Gunby, P.

Based on Tajfel and Turner’s (1979) social identification theory, we conjecture that team membership increases the degree of altruism towards another team member, and this in turn helps resolving the hold-up problem. We test this conjecture in a laboratory experiment. Our subjects are randomly divided into two teams and given their respective team uniforms to wear. In Task 1 they answer two trivia questions and can use a chat program to help their team members. In Task 2 the subjects play a standard hold-up game with a member of their own team (representing integration) or with a member of the other team (non-integration).

Applications include a discussion of the timing and potential causes of the British Industrial Revolution, income 'convergence' and the long run behaviour of English Real Wages 1264 – 1913. Finally some new and potentially useful developments are discussed including the mildly explosive processes; graphical modelling and long memory.","RePEc Working Paper Series: No: 56/2010",,,"Greasley, D., Oxley, L.

The PCSE estimator is commonly used when working with time-series, crosssectional (TSCS) data. In an influential paper, Beck and Katz (1995) (henceforth BK) demonstrated that FGLS produces coefficient standard errors that are severely underestimated. They report Monte Carlo experiments in which the PCSE estimator produces accurate standard error estimates at no, or little, loss in efficiency compared to FGLS. Our study further investigates the properties of the PCSE estimator. We first
reproduce the main experimental results of BK using their Monte Carlo framework. We then show that the PCSE estimator does not perform as well when tested in data environments that better resemble 'practical research situations.' When (i) the explanatory variable(s) are characterized by substantial persistence, (ii) there is serial correlation in the errors, and (iii)
the time span of the data series is relatively short, coverage rates for the PCSE estimator frequently fall between 80 and 90 percent.

different types of probability models and the various models are all found to be largely
consistent with each other. The insights from these estimation methods are then
bolstered by detailed follow-up case studies of individual firms in different industries

from both forms of evidence-gathering suggest that in a small and isolated local market

innovation. The reason appears to be that the notion of ‘small’ itself may have an
absolute minimum threshold, below which translating entrepreneurship into innovation
becomes problematic. As such, applying theories of local economic development to
local economies which exhibit similar features to New Zealand may require us to adjust

While the sequential treatment allows for strategic use of trust, in the simultaneous treatment the first mover’s action is not observed and hence does not signal her belief.

Therefore, we change two features of the Dufwenberg and Gneezy protocol: (i) instead of the strategy method we implement a direct response method (sequential play) for the decision of the second mover; and (ii) we use paper money certificates that are passed between the subjects rather than having subjects write down numbers representing their decisions.

"4825","10092/695","Dixon, K.",,,,,,,"2009",,"Purpose – Accounting has been shown to figure variously in New Higher Education.
However, despite their infant precursors having been labelled curricular accounting
(Theodossin, 1986), accounting researchers have overlooked a collection of calculative
practices that has grown and spread internationally over the past two decades. The collection in question comprises credit points, levels of learning, level descriptors, learning outcomes, and related characteristics of student transcripts and diploma supplements, qualification frameworks and credit transfer systems. This paper extends coverage of the accounting
literature to this particular variant of accounting.
Design/Methodology/Approach – The subject is addressed both in a technical way and in
the broader context of accounting in organisations and society. The former University of New Zealand and its affiliate in Christchurch, New Zealand, and the University of Canterbury, also of that city, are used as a case study. The credit point system in place at the University of
Canterbury in 2009 and its antecedents back to 1873 are analysed genealogically. Participantobservation and related means are used to collect data. These data are analysed using ideas of representational schemes, path-dependent changes and negotiated orders among parties who
have been associated with the case institutions.
Findings – The analysis illuminates how and why learning (and teaching) at the University of Canterbury has come to be specified, recorded and controlled using curricular accounting; and why the accounting in use accords conceptually and, to an increasing degree, in practice
to that in use across tertiary education in many countries. Among the social, economic and political issues that have spurred on this spread are international standards, quality and equivalence of tertiary education qualifications, study and learning; diversification of
participation in tertiary education; changes to the levels and sources of funding tertiary
education; and the many and varied ideas, etc. associated with New Higher Education. The spread has multifarious consequences for students, academics, alumni, universities and
similar institutions, higher education, governments and others. There is much scope for further research.
Research limitations/ implications – The findings are derived from an accounting
perspective and there is scope for adding other perspectives.
Practical Implications – A synopsis of curricular accounting and several of its facets are synthesised in this one paper, along with its history and with issues that are likely to with its history and with issues that are likely to
condition further developments.

The non-stationary model means that the location parameter in the GEV distribution is a linear function of time to detect temporal trends in maximum rainfall. Second, we compute the future behavior of stationary models for the return levels of 10, 20, 50 and 100-years based on the period 1960-2010.

The mispricing between spot and futures market also attracts investors to single stock futures market. Moreover the factors, such as a size of contract, tick size and age of contract on particular stock significantly contribute to increase open interest and traded volume.

The paper analyses the leading international journals in the Economics sub-disciplines of Energy, Environmental and Resource Economics using quantifiable Research Assessment Measures (RAMs), and highlights the similarities and differences in alternative RAMs. The RAMs are based on alternative transformations of citations taken from the ISI database. Alternative RAMs may be calculated annually or updated daily to answer the perennial questions as to When, Where and How (frequently) published papers are cited (see Chang et al. (2011a, b, c)). The RAMs include the most widely used RAM, namely the classic 2-year impact factor including journal self citations (2YIF), 2-year impact factor excluding journal self citations (2YIF*), 5-year impact factor including journal self citations (5YIF), Immediacy (or zero-year impact factor (0YIF)), Eigenfactor, Article Influence, C3PO (Citation Performance Per Paper Online), h-index, PI-BETA (Papers Ignored - By Even The Authors), 2-year Self-citation Threshold Approval Ratings (2Y-STAR), Historical Self-citation Threshold Approval Ratings (H-STAR), Impact Factor Inflation (IFI), and Cited Article Influence (CAI). As data are not available for 5YIF, Article Influence and CAI for one of the 20 journals considered, 13 RAMs are analysed for 19 highly-cited journals in Energy, Environmental and Resource Economics in the ISI category of Economics. Harmonic mean rankings of the 13 RAMs for the 19 highly-cited journals are also presented. It is shown that emphasizing the 2-year impact factor of a journal, which partly answers the question as to When published papers are cited, to the exclusion of other informative RAMs, which answer Where and How (frequently) published papers are cited, can lead to a distorted evaluation of journal impact and influence relative to the Harmonic Mean rankings.","RePEc Working Paper Series 43/2011",,,"Chang, C-L., McAleer, M.

Their effect is to effectively split sentencing into three distinct time periods, viz., the period following the introduction of the De Spa Guidelines to the implementation of the Sentencing Act 2002, the second following the joint implementation of the Sentencing Act and the Health and Safety in Employment Amendment Act to the Hanham & Philp Guideline judgment in December 2008, and the third is the post Hanham & Philp Guideline period.  This article builds on previous work that analyses the various factors relevant to HSE sentencing, concentrating on the second and third periods. Among other results, this work shows that for period 3, although harm continues to play an important role in explaining sentences of reparation, its previous role in directly explaining levels of fines is replaced by various levels of employer culpability. The Hanham & Philp decisions incorporated harm in determining culpability and District Court judges appear to follow this judgment closely in this respect. The present article illustrates forecasted sentences for periods 2 and 3, and, for the forecasts of period 3 penalties using second period weights, finds that fines would have been frequently lower, often substantially so, than those that occurred, consistent with the Hanham & Philp Guidelines.

Pearson correlation coefficients and Spearman rank order correlation coefficients are used to show that there is a greater correlation between online quizzes and invigilated assessments when those quizzes are only available for a restricted period of time, compared to the whole semester. We find that online quizzes are more closely correlated with invigilated assessments when the first attempt at a quiz is recorded, as opposed to the highest of two attempts.

The risk estimates of these models are used to determine capital requirements and associated capital costs of ADIs, depending in part on the number of previous violations, whereby realised losses exceed the estimated VaR. McAleer et al. (2009) proposed a new approach to model selection for predicting VaR, consisting of combining alternative risk models, and comparing conservative and aggressive strategies for choosing between VaR models. This paper addresses the question of risk management of risk, namely VaR of VIX futures prices, and extends the approaches given in McAleer et al. (2009) and Chang et al. (2011) to examine how different risk management strategies performed during the 2008-09 global financial crisis (GFC). The empirical results suggest that an aggressive strategy of choosing the Supremum of single model forecasts, as compared with Bayesian and non-Bayesian combinations of models, is preferred to other alternatives, and is robust during the GFC. However, this strategy implies relatively high numbers of violations and accumulated losses, which are admissible under the Basel II Accord.","RePEc Working Papers Series: No. 26/2011",,,"Casarin, R., Chang, C.L., Jiménez-Martín, J., McAleer, M., Pérez-Amara, T.

The robust forecast was based on the median of the point VaR forecasts of a set of conditional volatility models. In this paper we provide further evidence on the suitability of the median as a GFC-robust strategy by using an additional set of new extreme value forecasting models and by extending the sample period for comparison. These extreme value models include DPOT and Conditional EVT. Such models might be expected to be useful in explaining financial data, especially in the presence of extreme shocks that arise during a GFC. Our empirical results confirm that the median remains GFC-robust even in the presence of these new extreme value models. This is illustrated by using the S&P500 index before, during and after the 2008-09 GFC. We investigate the performance of a variety of single and combined VaR forecasts in terms of daily capital requirements and violation penalties under the Basel II Accord, as well as other criteria, including several tests for independence of the violations. The strategy based on the median, or more generally, on combined forecasts of single models, is straightforward to incorporate into existing computer software packages that are used by banks and other financial institutions.","RePEc Working Paper Series: No. 28/2011",,,"Santos, P.S., Jiménez-Martín, J., Michael McAleer, M., Amaral, T.

Under weak-form efficiency, the correlation between the current and one-period lagged revisions should be zero. The empirical findings in the literature suggest that the null hypothesis of zero correlation between the current and one-period lagged revisions is rejected quite frequently, where the correlation can be either positive or negative. In this paper we propose a methodology to be able to interpret such non-zero correlations in a straightforward manner. Our approach is based on the assumption that forecasts can be decomposed into both an econometric model and expert intuition. The interpretation of the sign of the correlation between the current and one-period lagged revisions depends on the process governing intuition, and the correlation between intuition and news.","RePEc Working Paper Series: No. 25/2011",,,"Franses, P.H., Chang, C.L., McAleer, M.

China's net imports of dairy products, however, has expanded at a growth rate in excess of 30% during the same period. To consider why China is still struggling to meet rising dairy product demand in China in the new millennium, this paper employs a new set of farm-level survey data and stochastic input distance functions to empirically estimate Total factor Productivity (TFP) on China's dairy farms. The results show that the TFP growth has been positive on and this rise in productivity has been mostly driven by technological change. However, the new results show that on average, the same farms have been behind the advancing technical frontier. We also find one of the drivers of the dairy farms' productivity advances is the relatively robust rate of technological change. The results suggest that efforts to achieve increased adoption of new technologies and better advice on how to use the technologies and manage production and marketing within the dairy farm sector, will likely further increase TFP growth in China.","JEL Classification: D240, Q100, Q160",,,"Ma, H., Oxley, L., Guo, S., Tang, H., Wu, Y., Huang, J., Rae, A., Rozelle, S.

A successful MSA will find the optimal trade-off between the two types of errors

If that is the case, and if the benefit in terms of improved assessment is substantial, then it follows that grade outcomes using CR questions should be different from those using MC questions. We investigate this using a large dataset composed of individual assessment results from thousands of students in introductory economics classes at a large public university. Empirical analysis of our large sample of students indicates that a switch to an all-MC format would result in grade changes that are in the “small” to moderate range when compared to grade changes that occur between assessments. This evidence suggests that CR questions could be abandoned at relatively little cost in grading accuracy. However, there are other arguments in favour of keeping CR questions. In particular, it has been suggested that students perceive a mix of CR and MC as “fairer” than an assessment composed exclusively of one or the other question type. Further, some instructors believe that CR questions encourage students to study harder.

The subject is of interest given the influential role that the government plays in Chinese firms' overseas activities, and the fact that the government may have objectives other than maximization of shareholder wealth. We examine 145 OMAs by Chinese acquiring firms over the year 1994-2008. We find some evidence that markets positively responded to news of Chinese OMAs. However, we also find that markets responded less favorably after China implemented its Go Global policy encouraging overseas investment. We hypothesize two reasons for this: First, the expansion of OMAs under Go Global resulted in Chinese firms pursuing less attractive targets, on average. Second, Go Global re-directed investment towards industries having national strategic value but diminished profit value. Using a Blinder-Oaxaca decomposition procedure, we find no evidence to support this latter hypothesis. Thus, to whatever extent strategic interests may motivate China's Go Global policy, it does not appear that their pursuit has come at the expense of shareholder wealth.","RePEc working paper series No. 25/2010",,,"Gu, L., Reed, W.R.

The latter is done using the Carhart (1997) 4-factor asset-pricing model. In addition, we investigate whether Polish fund managers exhibit “hot hands”, persistence in performance. Finally the influence of fund characteristics on risk-adjusted performance is considered. Our overall results suggest that Polish mutual funds on average are not able to add value, as indicated by their negative net alphas. Interestingly, domestic funds outperform internationally investing funds, which points at informational advantages of local over foreign investors. Finally, we detect strong persistence in mean returns up to 1 year. It is striking that “winning” funds are able to significantly beat the market, based on their significantly positive alpha’s.

theoretical literature on the elicitation of subjective probabilities, and an equally large empirical
literature. However, there is a gulf between the two. The theoretical literature proposes a range of
procedures that can be used to recover subjective probabilities, but stresses the need to make strong
auxiliary assumptions or “calibrating adjustments” to elicited reports in order to recover the latent
probability. With some notable exceptions, the empirical literature seems intent on either making
those strong assumptions or ignoring the need for calibration. We illustrate how the joint estimation of
risk attitudes and subjective probabilities using structural maximum likelihood methods can provide the
calibration adjustments that theory calls for. This allows the observer to make inferences about the
latent subjective probability, calibrating for virtually any well-specified model of choice under
uncertainty. We demonstrate our procedures with experiments in which we elicit subjective
probabilities. We calibrate the estimates of subjective beliefs assuming that choices are made
consistently with expected utility theory or rank-dependent utility theory. Inferred subjective
probabilities are significantly different when calibrated according to either theory, thus showing the
importance of undertaking such exercises. Our findings also have implications for the interpretation
of probabilities inferred from prediction markets.","This is one major paper in a portfolio of 3 papers on using scoring rule methods for belief elicitation.

The optimal simple instrument rule also fails to account for the UIP puzzle.

We examine violation rates, back-testing criteria, market risk charges and quantile loss function values to measure and assess the forecasting performance of a variety of risk models.

We primed MBA-student participants by administering questionnaires that concerned either gender/family or professional issues. Subsequently, participants undertook a real-effort task and chose between piece-rate and competitive-tournament compensation. Identity priming, moderated by gender, significantly affected preference for competitive pay. This relationship was partially mediated by beliefs about one?s performance ranking. The implications of our results are profound. The decision to avoid competition made by many female professionals may be driven not by lack of ability, but rather by the increased salience of gender/family identity, influenced by marriage and motherhood over time. Indeed, activation of internalized identities might not only drive the experimental results, but also have strong implications for career choices and job performance of women, thus contributing to the observed gender and motherhood wage gaps.","RePEc Working Paper Series: No. 31/2011",,,"Cadsby, B., Servatka, M., Song, F.

The volatility of an asset of composite index can be traded by using volatility derivatives, such as volatility and variance swaps, options and futures. The most popular volatility index is VIX, which is a key measure of market expectations of volatility, and hence also an important barometer of investor sentiment and market volatility. Investors interpret the VIX cash index as a “fear” index, and of VIX options and VIX futures as derivatives of the “fear” index. VIX is based on S&P500 call and put options over a wide range of strike prices, and hence is not model based. Speculators can trade on volatility risk with VIX derivatives, with views on whether volatility will increase or decrease in the future, while hedgers can use volatility derivatives to avoid exposure to volatility risk. VIX and its options and futures derivatives has been widely analysed in recent years. An alternative volatility derivative to VIX is the S&P500 variance futures, which is an expectation of the variance of the S&P500 cash index. Variance futures are futures contracts written on realized variance, or standardized variance swaps. The S&P500 variance futures are not model based, so the assumptions underlying the index do not seem to have been clearly understood. As variance futures are typically thinly traded, their returns and volatility are not easy to model accurately using a variety of model specifications. This paper analyses the volatility in S&P500 3-month variance futures before, during and after the GFC, as well as for the full data period, for each of three alternative conditional volatility models and three densities, in order to determine whether exposure to risk can be incorporated into a financial portfolio without taking positions on the S&P500 index itself.",,,,"Chang, C-L., Jimenez-Martin, J.A.,  McAleer, M., Perez Amaral, T.

China’s increasing integration into the global market may have important consequences
for investors in related markets. In order to capture these potential effects, we explore these issues using an Autoregressive Moving Average (ARMA) return equation. A univariate GARCH model is then adopted to test for the persistence of volatility in stock market returns, as represented by
stock market indices. Finally, univariate GARCH, multivariate VARMA-GARCH, and multivariate VARMA-AGARCH models are used to test for constant conditional correlations and volatility spillover effects across these markets. Each model is used to calculate the conditional volatility between both the Shenzhen and Shanghai Chinese markets and several other markets around the
Pacific Basin Area, including Australia, Hong Kong, Japan, Taiwan and Singapore, during four distinct periods, beginning 27 August 1991 and ending 17 November 2010. The empirical results show some evidence of volatility spillovers across these markets in the pre-GFC periods, but there is
little evidence of spillover effects from China to related markets during the GFC. This is presumably because the GFC was initially a US phenomenon, before spreading to developed markets around the globe, so that it was not a Chinese phenomenon.",,,,"Allena, D.E., Amrama, R., McAleer, M.

The method most commonly used is the market model.  This often fails to meet the OLS requirement of normally distributed residuals, and tends to furnish regression output (low R2, and insignificant t- and F-statistics) that, in other contexts, one would not rely on.  With respect to data sets fraught with thin trading, the problem is exacerbated since missing data tends usually to be proxied by zero-value returns whose rate of occurrence distorts the computation of OLS parameters.  A family of models, in which company and market return relationships are separated out by dummy variables, offer improved computation of expected returns when applied to thinly-traded data sets.  The best of these is a 3-state (by company) model. Abnormal returns from this model are compared with those from the market model in detecting dividend and earnings signals and are found to make a similar diagnosis.","WORKING PAPER No. 02/2013  ",,,"Anderson, W.

The paper analyses 299 leading international journals in Economics using quantifiable Research Assessment Measures (RAMs), and highlights the similarities and differences in various RAMs, which are based on alternative transformations of citations. All existing RAMs to date have been static, so two new dynamic RAMs are developed to capture changes in impact factor over time and escalating journal self citations. Alternative RAMs may be calculated annually or updated daily to determine When, Where and How (frequently) published papers are cited (see Chang et al. (2011a, b, c)). The RAMs are grouped in four distinct classes that include impact factor, mean citations and non-citations, journal policy, number of high quality papers, and journal influence and article influence. These classes include the most widely used RAMs, namely the classic 2-year impact factor including journal self citations (2YIF), 2-year impact factor excluding journal self citations (2YIF*), 5-year impact factor including journal self citations (5YIF), Eigenfactor (or Journal Influence), Article Influence, h-index, and PI-BETA (Papers Ignored - By Even The Authors). As all existing RAMs to date have been static, two new dynamic RAMs are developed to capture changes in impact factor over time (5YD2 = 5YIF/2YIF) and Escalating Self Citations. We highlight robust rankings based on the harmonic mean of the ranks of RAMs across the 4 classes. It is shown that emphasizing the 2-year impact factor of a journal, which partly answers the question as to When published papers are cited, to the exclusion of other informative RAMs, which answer Where and How (frequently) published papers are cited, can lead to a distorted evaluation of journal quality, impact and influence relative to the harmonic mean of the ranks.","WORKING PAPER No. 05/2012 ",,,"Chang, C-L., Maasoumi, E., McAleer, M.

The formal evaluation of such forecasts has a long research history. Recently, a new angle to the evaluation of forecasts has been addressed, and in this review we analyse some recent developments from that perspective. The literature on forecast evaluation predominantly assumes that macroeconomic forecasts are generated from econometric models. In practice, however, most macroeconomic forecasts, such as those from the IMF, World Bank, OECD, Federal Reserve Board, Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) and the ECB, are typically based on econometric model forecasts jointly with human intuition. This seemingly inevitable combination renders most of these forecasts biased and, as such, their evaluation becomes non-standard. In this review, we consider the evaluation of two forecasts in which: (i) the two forecasts are generated from two distinct econometric models; (ii) one forecast is generated from an econometric model and the other is obtained as a combination of a model and intuition; and (iii) the two forecasts are generated from two distinct (but unknown) combinations of different models and intuition. It is shown that alternative tools are needed to compare and evaluate the forecasts in each of these three situations. These alternative techniques are illustrated by comparing the forecasts from the (econometric) Staff of the Federal Reserve Board and the FOMC on inflation, unemployment and real GDP growth.  It is shown that the FOMC does not forecast significantly better than the Staff, and that the intuition of the FOMC does not add significantly in forecasting the actual values of the economic fundamentals. This would seem to belie the purported expertise of the FOMC.",,,,"Franses, P. H., McAleer, M., Legerstee, R. (2012) Evaluating Macroeconomic Forecasts:

The RAMs are grouped in four distinct classes that include impact factor, mean citations and non-citations, journal policy, number of high quality papers, and journal influence and article influence. These classes include the most widely used RAMs, namely the classic 2-year impact factor including journal self-citations (2YIF), 2-year impact factor excluding journal self-citations (2YIF*), 5-year impact factor including journal self-citations (5YIF), Eigenfactor (or Journal Influence), Article Influence, h-index, PI-BETA (Papers Ignored - By Even The Authors), 5YD2 (= 5YIF/2YIF) as a measure of citations longevity, and Escalating Self Citations (ESC) as a measure of increasing journal self-citations. The paper highlights robust rankings based on the harmonic mean of the ranks of RAMs across the 4 classes. We show that focusing solely on the 2-year impact factor (2YIF) of a journal, which partly answers the question as to When published papers are cited, to the exclusion of other informative RAMs, which answer Where and How (frequently) published papers are cited, can distort the evaluation of journal quality, impact and influence, relative to the more robust harmonic mean of the ranks.","WORKING PAPER No. 11/2012",,,"McAleer, M., Chang, C-L.

The paper also compares the two new bibliometric measures with two existing ISI metrics, namely Total Citations and the 5-year Impact Factor (5YIF) (including journal self-citations) of a journal. It is shown that the Sciences and Social Sciences are different in terms of the strength of the relationship of journal performance metrics, although the actual relationships are very similar. Moreover, the journal influence and article influence journal performance metrics are shown to be closely related empirically to the two existing ISI metrics, and hence add little in practical usefulness to what is already known, except for eliminating the pressure arising from coercive journal self-citations. These empirical results are compared with existing results in the bibliometrics literature.","WORKING PAPER No. 12/2013  ",,,"Chang, C-L., McAleer, M., Oxley, L.

While the trade-to-trade model of Maynes and Rumsey (1993) addresses the problem of thin trading by eliminating periods in which no trading is recorded, the proposed improvement addresses the influence of zero-value returns resulting from liquidity trading.  This entails segmentation by the sign of company returns (positive, negative, zero). The approach allows for all levels of thinness in security trading. It is evaluated against the trade-to-trade methodology developed by Maynes and Rumsey (1993) and the Market Model using Monte Carlo simulations developed from the method of Brown and Warner (1980 and 1985).  The improved trade-to-trade model is better at picking up the presence of very small levels of abnormal performance.","WORKING PAPER No. 18/2012",,,"Anderson, W.

The empirical results show that both the ARMA(1,1)-GARCH(1,1) and ARMA(3,2)-GJR(1,1) models are suitable for modelling ENSO volatility accurately, and that 1998 is a turning point, which indicates that the ENSO strength has increased since 1998. Moreover, the increasing ENSO strength is due to the increase in greenhouse gas emissions. The ENSO strengths for Sea Surface Temperature (SST) are predicted for the year 2030 to increase from 29.62% to 81.5% if global CO2 emissions increase by 40% to 110%, respectively.

Resilient Organisations and the University of Canterbury began a series of quantitative 
investigations into the recovery and response of key business sectors to the earthquakes.
The purpose of this study was to build on this work by exploring the outcomes of the 
earthquakes on the tourism sector, a critical economic driver in the region. Two postal 
surveys were sent to 719 tourism business managers; the first to businesses in the ‘Impact 
Zone’ defined as areas that experienced Modified Mercalli intensities greater than 6. The 
second survey was sent to the remaining businesses throughout the Canterbury region

Among the De Spa Guidelines we find that the level of harm in particular, and employer culpability are not only consistently represented among significant determinants of HSE sentences in respect of fines and total liability faced by employers, but also emerge as important determinants of awards to accident victims. These results hold at the single s 6 charge level and at the case level, as well as for alternative specifications of our estimating model. Considering the two periods separately, we find that estimated coefficients are considerably larger in magnitude for the latter period.

A comparison is made with publicly available bibliometric data, namely the Thomson Reuters ISI Web of Sci-ence citations database (hereafter ISI) for the Business - Finance (hereafter Finance) category. The paper analyses the leading international journals in Finance using expert scores and quantifiable Research Assessment Measures (RAMs), and highlights the similarities and differences in the expert scores and alternative RAMs, where the RAMs are based on alternative transformations of citations taken from the ISI database. Alternative RAMs may be calculated annually or updated daily to answer the perennial questions as to When, Where and How (frequently) published papers are cited (see Chang et al. 2011a,b,c). The RAMs include the most widely used RAM, namely the classic 2-year impact factor including journal self citations (2YIF), 2-year impact factor excluding journal self citations (2YIF*), 5-year impact factor including journal self citations (5YIF), Immediacy (or zero-year impact factor, 0YIF), Eigenfactor, Article Influence, C3PO (Citation Performance Per Paper Online), h-index, PI-BETA (Papers Ignored - By Even The Authors), 2-year Self-citation Threshold Approval Ratings (2Y-STAR), Historical Self-citation Threshold Approval Ratings (H-STAR), Impact Factor Inflation (IFI), and Cited Article Influence (CAI). As data are not available for 5YIF, Article Influence and CAI for 13 of the leading 34 journals considered, 10 RAMs are analysed for 21 highly-cited journals in Finance. The harmonic mean of the ranks of the 10 RAMs for the 34 highly-cited journals are also presented. It is shown that emphasizing the 2-year impact factor of a journal, which partly answers the question as to When published papers are cited, to the exclusion of other informative RAMs, which answer Where and How (frequently) published papers are cited, can lead to a distorted evaluation of journal impact and influence relative to the Harmonic Mean rankings. A linear regression model is used to forecast expert scores on the basis of RAMs that capture journal impact, journal policy, the number of high quality papers, and quantitative in-formation about a journal. The robustness of the rankings is also analysed.","WORKING PAPER No. 10/2013",,,"Chang, C-L., McAleer, M. (2013) What Do Experts Know About Forecasting Journal Quality?

We fit the rainfall data with stationary and non-stationary generalized extreme value distributions (GEV), and estimate their future behaviour based on the best fitting model. The non-stationary model means that the parameter of location of the GEV distribution is formulated as linear and quadratic functions of time to detect temporal trends in the maximum rainfall. Future behavior refers to the return level and the return period of the extreme rainfall. The 10, 20, 50 and 100-years return levels and their 95% confidence intervals of the return levels stationary models are provided. The return period is calculated based on the record-high (ranked 1st) extreme rainfall brought by the top 10 typhoons for each station in Taiwan. The estimates show that non-stationary model with increasing trend is suitable for the Kaohsiung, Hengchun, Taitung and Dawu stations. The Kaohsing and Hengchun stations have greater trends than the other two stations, showing that the positive trend extreme rainfall in the southern region is greater than in the eastern region of Taiwan. In addition, the Keelung, Anbu, Zhuzihu, Tamsui, Yilan, Taipei, Hsinchu, Taichung, Alishan, Yushan and Tainan stations are fitted well with the Gumbel distribution, while the Sun Moon Lake, Hualien and Chenggong stations are fitted well with the GEV distribution",,,,"Chu, F-L., McAleer, M.

The new TFCI is straightforward to use and interpret, and provides interesting insights in predicting the current economic and financial environment for tourism stock index returns that are based on publicly available information.

Somewhat less controversial, but arguably no less serious, is undersea noise resulting from seismic surveys, dredging and construction activities, shipping, offshore wind farms, sonar use associated with fishing and ocean science experiments.
Recent scientific research indicates that sources of undersea noise such as military sonar can cause cetaceans and other marine mammals’ physiological damage.3 Moreover, recent instances of atypical mass
strandings have been linked to the use of tactical mid-frequency active sonar.4 The presence of undersea noise may also result in the exclusion of cetaceans from important habitats or impede reproductive and
feeding patterns.5 Finally, it should be noted that comparatively little research has been undertaken in connection with the impact of undersea noise on species other than cetaceans, such as fish and deep sea
squid,6 and no such research has been carried out in respect of diving birds such as penguins and cormorants. The issue of noise pollution and in particular, its impact on cetaceans, has reached the attention and the agenda of a number of international organisations concerned with the protection of the marine environment
and the protection of biodiversity. These organisations include the International Whaling Commission (IWC)7 and the 1979 Convention on Migratory Species.8 Both ASCOBANS 19929 and ACCOBAMS 199610 have
adopted resolutions on undersea noise and cetaceans and in particular, have addressed noise resulting from seismic surveys and whale watching activities.11 More generally, the impact of undersea noise on marine life
has been identified as an issue that would benefit from future attention of the General Assembly by the United Nations Open-Ended Informal Consultative Process on Oceans and the Law of the Sea (UNICPOLOS) in its fifth report published in 2004 and also in its sixth report published in 2005.12 As a consequence of this recommendation, the United Nations General Assembly in Resolution 60/30 (2005) declared that it
“encourages further studies and consideration of the impacts of ocean noise of marine living resources.”13 The Committee on Environmental Protection has discussed undersea noise in the Southern Ocean at
Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meetings since 200014 and the topic has benefited from examination by SCAR at workshops held in 2002, 2004 and 2006.","Information Paper Submitted by ASOC to CCAMLR XXV (Agenda Items 4, 6, 12, 15 & 16)",,,"Scott, K.N., Dolman, S.

These income effects are likely to cause misinterpretation when Tax Burden is used as a variable

Using insights from the economics of religion, we argue that anarchy is more likely than democracy to produce small groups with intense meddlesome preferences. Absent government provision of public goods, voluntary groups will emerge to fill the gap. Strict religious groups – ‘sects’ – are more able to overcome collective action problems and will therefore be more prevalent in an anarchic society. These sects are apt to instil intense meddlesome preferences in their members and have the ability to enforce them: anarchy produces the situation to which it is most fragile.

If animals have economic standing, then current practice makes excessive use of animals as production inputs and is thus economically inefficient. However, efficiency would not, in general, entail zero use. Optimal usage depends on the costs to animals and the benefits to humans and thus reflects the usual cost-benefit tradeoff inherent in economics.

theoretical literature on the elicitation of subjective probabilities, and an equally large empirical
literature. However, there is a gulf between the two. The theoretical literature proposes a range of
procedures that can be used to recover subjective probabilities, but stresses the need to make strong
auxiliary assumptions or “calibrating adjustments” to elicited reports in order to recover the latent
probability. With some notable exceptions, the empirical literature seems intent on either making
those strong assumptions or ignoring the need for calibration. We illustrate how the joint estimation of
risk attitudes and subjective probabilities using structural maximum likelihood methods can provide the
calibration adjustments that theory calls for. This allows the observer to make inferences about the
latent subjective probability, calibrating for virtually any well-specified model of choice under
uncertainty. We demonstrate our procedures with experiments in which we elicit subjective
probabilities. We calibrate the estimates of subjective beliefs assuming that choices are made
consistently with expected utility theory or rank-dependent utility theory. Inferred subjective
probabilities are significantly different when calibrated according to either theory, thus showing the
importance of undertaking such exercises. Our findings also have implications for the interpretation
of probabilities inferred from prediction markets.",,,,"Andersen, S., Fountain, J., Harrison, G.W., Rutström, E.E.

In particular, ethanol and be considered as a catalyst in this nexus because of its significance as a loading factor, a long-run error corrector and a short-run adjuster. Ethanol leads all commodities in the price discovery process in the long run. The negative cross-price open interest effects suggest that there is a money outflow from all commodities in response to increases in open interest positions in the corn futures markets, indicating that active arbitrage activity takes place in those markets. On the other hand, an increase in the soybean open interest contributes to fund inflows in the corn futures market and the other futures markets, leading to more speculative activities in these markets. In connection with open interest, the ethanol market fails because of its thin market. Finally, it is interesting to note that the long-run equilibrium (cointegrating relationship), speeds of adjustment and open interest across markets have strengthened significantly during the 2009-2011 economic recovery period, compared with the full and 2007-2009 Great Recession periods.","RePEc Working Paper Series: No. 24/2011",,,"Hammoudeh, S., Sarafrazi, S., Chang, C-L., McAleer, M.

"10971","10092/695","Dixon, K.",,,,,,,"2013",,"Purpose – University academics are important to the discovery and dissemination of knowledge about accounting practice and accounting learning. This article explores the consequences for the Pacific society of New Zealand of how these discovery and dissemination activities have come to be assessed for performance management, formulaic public funding and offshore accreditation. Design/methodology/approach – A longitudinal, bibliometric approach is taken to how knowledge about accounting practice and accounting learning in New Zealand has been disseminated over the past half century. The approach lends itself to the question of whether the trends revealed in the bibliometrics are suited to New Zealand audiences, including students, accountants, policymakers, Aotearoa New Zealand’s indigenous people and its diverse recent-settler populations, and Pacific New Zealand Society. One hundred and sixty accounting journals and several professional magazines are searched for articles based on empirical materials drawn from New Zealand. Findings – The findings relate to the geographical locations of the editors and the rankings of the periodicals that articles have been published in, and the topics the articles cover. The findings are interpreted in the broad contexts of academic activities, university development, and tertiary education policy and funding. Of the three activities associated with accounting in New Zealand universities, research has been the last to develop, starting with occasional articles penned by a small band of professors and published in the Chartered Accountants Journal (CAJ) and The Accounting Review. Now, research is often accorded the highest priority, as reflected in formal individual academic performance measurement systems, and related institutional incentives and penalties (exemplified by the Performance Based Research Fund of 2012). Measurement is conducted at the individual and institutional level, using criteria linked to lists of periodicals that are decidedly Atlantocentric. The CAJ has been deserted in favour of academic journals, virtually all based outside New Zealand. Academics have modified the way they report to suit the foreign editors and readerships. Publication patterns continue to change. Strong incentives and coercements seem to exist for New Zealand-based academics to behave selfishly for short-term survival. These persuaders seem to be wielded by a quasi-indigenous élite seeking to mimic their supposed superior counterparts elsewhere; and to dominate their subjects, and so exercise power and maintain their status. This is regardless of what might be better from a local, societal point of view. To publish about New Zealand, there is some advantage in studying areas in which New Zealand is seen as a “world leader” (e.g., Structural Adjustment, New Public Management, environmental accounting). This contrasts with areas about which the outside world is oblivious (e.g., New Zealand’s multicultural array of people and organisations, including the Maori people) or areas in which New Zealand lacks differences of “world” interest (e.g., financial collapses and director impropriety, what can be learnt from stock exchange data). Research limitations/implications – The research is confined to basic bibliometrics (a publication analysis, rather than citation or co-citation analyses), anecdotes and comparison with secondary sources. Originality/value – This study is concerned with whether knowledge about accounting practice and accounting learning in New Zealand is being disseminated in a way that suits those likely to be most interested and affected. It is distinct from most studies of this ilk, which attempt to rank journals or are about researcher productivity and author placement.",,,,"Dixon, K.

This article builds on previous work that analyses the various factors relevant to HSE sentencing, concentrating on the second and third periods. We find a difference in sentencing factors that matter at the single s 6 charge level versus the case level and also find that these factors differ across periods. In particular, although harm continues to play an important role in explaining sentences of reparation, its previous role in directly explaining levels of fines is replaced by various levels of employer culpability.

The analysis is based on two conditional multivariate models, BEKK-AGARCH and VARMA-AGARCH, in the volatility specification. Daily data from 1 July 2008 to 29 June 2012 for 999 firms are used, which covers the Global Financial Crisis. The empirical findings indicate that there are size effects on volatility spillovers from the exchange rate to firm performance. Specifically, the risk for firm size has different effects from the three leading tourism sources to Taiwan, namely USA, Japan, and China. Furthermore, all the return series reveal quite high volatility spillovers (at over sixty percent) with a one-period lag. The empirical results show a negative correlation between exchange rate returns and stock returns. However, the asymmetric effect of the shock is ambiguous, owing to conflicts in the significance and signs of the asymmetry effect in the two estimated multivariate GARCH models. The empirical findings provide financial managers with a better understanding of how firm size is related to financial performance, risk and portfolio management strategies that can be used in practice.","WORKING PAPER No. 04/2013",,,"Chang, C-L., Hsu, H-K., McAleer, M.

"10951","10092/695","McAleer, M.||Radalj, K.",,,,,,,"2013",,"Economists and financial analysts have begun to recognise the importance of the actions of other agents in the decision-making process. Herding is the deliberate mimicking of the decisions of other agents. Examples of mimicry range from the choice of restaurant, fash-ion and financial market participants, to academic research. Herding may conjure negative images of irrational agents sheepishly following the actions of others, but such actions can be rational under asymmetric information and uncertainty. This paper uses futures position data in nine different markets of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) to provide a direct test of herding behaviour, namely the extent to which small traders mimic the posi-tions of large speculators. Evidence consistent with herding among small traders is found for the Canadian dollar, British pound, gold, S&P 500 and Nikkei 225 futures. Consistent with survey-based results on technical analysis, the positions are significantly correlated with both current and past market returns. Using various time-varying volatility models to accommodate conditional heteroskedasticity, the empirical results are found to be robust to alternative models and methods of estimation. When a test of causality-in-variance is used to analyse if volatility among small traders spills over into spot markets, it is found that spillovers occur only with Nikkei 225 futures. The policy implications of the findings are also discussed.",,,,"McAleer, M., Radalj, K. (2013) Herding, Information Cascades and Volatility Spillovers in Futures Markets.
