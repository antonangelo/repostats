present study investigates whether such retrieval would occur to a recently inhibited object. In three experiments,
participants saw two successively presented stimuli (S1 and S2) that varied in color and orientation. The task was to respond
to the color or orientation of S2 in accordance with a task cue at the beginning of each trial. In separate experiments, we
manipulated the number of the trials on which the task relevant features of S1 and S2 were matched versus mismatched,
and the perceived object continuation between the two stimuli. Evidence for spontaneous feature retrieval was found when
S1 and S2 could be seen as different instantiations of the same object but not when they were likely to be perceived as
different types of objects. These results suggest that the features of a previously inhibited object can be retrieved
spontaneously. However, such retrieval and its effect on a subsequent stimulus depend on the perceived object continuity
between the two successive stimuli.",,"Chen, Z., Yeh, Y-Y (2013) Perceived object continuity and spontaneous retrieval of features from an inhibited object.

However the development of alternatives is primarily the responsibility of applicants. In practice this usually leads to proposals that maximise the interests of applicants and result in adverse effects at the margins of acceptability. This paper describes the application of collaborative approaches to two controversial storage proposals in Canterbury – a dam on the Orari River and the Hurunui Water Project (a storage on the South Branch of the Hurunui River and control gates on Lake Sumner). Both processes led to the development of different alternatives which were superior in terms of sustainable management, lower impacts and greater community acceptance – respectively an off-river storage taking high flows from the Rangitata River, and, a series of storages on the Waitohi River, a tributary to the Hurunui.
The use of collaborative processes as an alternative to RMA processes to resolve issues was initially resisted by applicants. However there has been a high level of acceptance of the value of collaboration after innovative alternatives were developed. Some of the key learning outcomes from this approach include: the value of collaborative engagement with affected communities outside of adversarial RMA processes; the improvements in alternative generation from collaboration if affected communities can meaningfully participate in decisions on alternative selection; and, the limitations of RMA processes in achieving sustainable management.",,"Jenkins, B.R.

We are seeing the growth of multi-criteria decision making frameworks that can score different factors and weight different criteria to provide overall scores for alternatives to indicate a preferred decision. Legal processes have been developed with complex submission and submission-on-submissions procedures to inform independent commissioners of the variety of viewpoints that need to be considered in their deliberations on the merits of proposals.
However these technical and legal processes may not be the most effective decision making processes for the sustainable management of scarce resources involving multiple users. Ostrom has identified “collective choice arrangements” as one of the design principles for the management of common pool resources, such as water or fisheries.
This paper describes the decision making process for developing the Canterbury Water Management Strategy. This process was designed to be dynamic and collaborative with stakeholder and community engagement. The steps in the community engagement process defined the decision making process. This is not to say that the technical and legal processes were not followed, rather, they were subsidiary to the community engagement process.
The paper describes the activities associated with the seven milestones of the community engagement process:
(1) Release and announcement
(2) Definition of the process
(3) Identification of the breadth of uses and benefits
(4) Public reporting of uses and benefits

The paper examines the provision of storage, water use efficiency, environmental flow adjustments, nutrients from land use intensification, biodiversity enhancements and kaitiakitanga. The collaborative process has led to some more sustainable changes. One is the use of off-river storage and tributary storage as alternatives to mainstem storage. A second is improved environmental flow regimes by increasing minimum flows and reducing allocations at low flows; but enabling access to allocations at higher flows and providing time to adjust to new requirements.
The parallel achievement of reduced nitrate loads and increased irrigation areas is proving problematic. Water use efficiency is advancing on some fronts – piped distribution replacing canal distribution and ongoing conversions to spray irrigation – but not on others – soil moisture demand irrigation and reallocation of surface and groundwater use to enhance recharge. Biodiversity enhancements and incorporating kaitiakitanga in water management are showing positive progress.
Some of the key emerging issues include the allocation of nitrate capacity between existing and new users, and, the need for increased capacity for predictive modelling and field measurement to improve management of the use of scarce water and the cumulative effects of its use.",,"Jenkins, B.R.

processes. Noticeably scarce from the study of C. elegans locomotion is the measurement of the nematode
locomotion forces together with other important locomotive metrics. To bridge the current gap, we
present the investigation of C. elegans muscular forces and locomotion metrics (speed, amplitude and
wavelength) in one single assay. This assay uses polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) micropillars as force sensing
elements and, by variation of the pillar arrangement, introduces microstructure. To show the usefulness of
the assay, twelve wild-type C. elegans sample worms were tested to obtain a total of 4665 data points. The
experimental results lead to several key findings. These include: (1) maximum force is exerted when the
pillar is in contact with the middle part of the worm body, (2) C. elegans locomotion forces are highly
dependent on the structure of the surrounding environment, (3) the worms’ undulation frequency and
locomotion speed increases steadily from the narrow spacing of ‘honeycomb’ design to the wider spacing
of ‘lattice’ pillar arrangement, and (4) C. elegans maintained their natural sinusoidal movement in the
microstructured device, despite the existence of PDMS micropillars. The assay presented here focuses on
wild type C. elegans, but the method can be easily applied to its mutants and other organisms. In addition,
we also show that, by inverting the measurement device, worm locomotion behaviour can be studied in
various substrate environments normally unconducive to flexible pillar fabrication. The quantitative

This earthquake was centred approximately 10km south-east of the Christchurch CBD at a shallow depth of 5km, resulting in intense seismic shaking within the Christchurch central business district (CBD). Unlike the 4 Sept earthquake when limited-to-moderate damage was observed in engineered reinforced concrete (RC) buildings [35], in the 22 February event a high number of RC Buildings in the Christchurch CBD (16.2 % out of 833) were severely damaged. There were 182 fatalities, 135 of which were the unfortunate consequences of the complete collapse of two mid-rise RC buildings.
This paper describes immediate observations of damage to RC buildings in the 22 February 2011 Christchurch earthquake. Some preliminary lessons are highlighted and discussed in light of the observed performance of the RC building stock. Damage statistics and typical damage patterns are presented for various configurations and lateral resisting systems. Data was collated predominantly from first-hand post-earthquake reconnaissance observations by the authors, complemented with detailed assessment of the structural drawings of critical buildings and the observed behaviour.
Overall, the 22 February 2011 Mw 6.2 Christchurch earthquake was a particularly severe test for both modern seismically-designed and existing non-ductile RC buildings. The sequence of earthquakes since the 4 Sept 2010, particularly the 22 Feb event has confirmed old lessons and brought to life new critical ones, highlighting some urgent action required to remedy structural deficiencies in both existing and “modern” buildings. Given the major social and economic impact of the earthquakes to a country with strong seismic engineering tradition, no doubt some aspects of the seismic design will be improved based on the lessons from Christchurch. The bar needs to and can be raised, starting with a strong endorsement of new damage-resisting, whilst cost-efficient, technologies as well as the strict enforcement, including financial incentives, of active policies for the seismic retrofit of existing buildings at a national scale.",,"Kam, W.Y., Pampanin, S., Elwood, K.

The renewed challenge is to be able to provide low-cost, thus more widely affordable, high-seismic-performance structures capable of sustaining a design level earthquake with limited or negligible damage, minimum disruption of business (downtime) or, in more general terms, controllable socio-economical losses.
The Canterbury earthquakes sequence in 2010-2011 has represented a tough reality check, confirming the current mismatch between societal expectations over the reality of seismic performance of modern buildings. In general, albeit with some unfortunate exceptions, modern multi-storey buildings performed as expected from a technical point of view, in particular when considering the intensity of the shaking (higher than new code design) they were subjected to. As per capacity design principles, plastic hinges formed in discrete regions, allowing the buildings to sway and stand and people to evacuate. Nevertheless, in many cases, these buildings were deemed too expensive to be repaired and were consequently demolished.
Targeting life-safety is arguably not enough for our modern society, at least when dealing with new building construction. A paradigm shift towards damage-control design philosophy and technologies is urgently required.
This paper and the associated presentation will discuss motivations, issues and, more importantly, cost-effective engineering solutions to design buildings capable of sustaining low-level of damage and thus limited business interruption after a design level earthquake. Focus will be given to the extensive research and developments in jointed ductile connections based upon controlled rocking & dissipating mechanisms for either reinforced concrete and, more recently, laminated timber structures.
An overview of recent on-site applications of such systems, featuring some of the latest technical solutions developed in the laboratory and including proposals for the rebuild of Christchurch, will be provided as successful examples of practical implementation of performance-based seismic design theory and technology.",,"Pampanin, S.

It shows how activities, teaching and children’s learning interacted in an on-going and mutually-beneficial way.  These interactions enabled the emergence of a new game, and enhanced a teacher’s and children’s thinking/learning in and about games of chase. 
 
Complexity thinking is a way of thinking and acting that assumes we live in a complex world (Davis & Sumara, 2006) where inter-connections abound and they affect us in visible and invisible ways.  To use complexity thinking in teaching and learning means to firstly, be conscious of the mutually-influencing (coupled) connections which exist/can exist in our setting; and secondly, focus our teaching on expanding possibilities in activities, teaching and learning in ways that are ethical, logical and meaningful for individuals and collectives/groups.
 
The research was conducted at an early childhood centre in Christchurch with mainly three- and four-year old children.  I took on the role of teacher, researcher and curriculum designer for 14 weeks and collected multiple types of data, including video and audio data, fieldnotes, photographs and learning stories.  I used the data to create on-going stories about children’s learning, my teaching and the activities the children and I engaged in; this approach enabled ongoing data, knowledge and emergent opportunities to be incorporated into the research process.  
This research generated two innovations that enhanced my thinking-practice as a teacher.  The first was a curriculum content framework for teachers and children to collaboratively explore games of chase and co-create new games.  The second was a framework for curriculum decision-making which focuses on fostering new learning, activities and teaching ideas and strategies.

By enacting the two frameworks in a coupled way, the children and I were able to co-create variations of several games of chase, as well as to occasion a new one.  The children also (1) learnt to distinguish between players and non-players in a shared play area, (2) learnt to tag in different ways, (3) experienced the nature of games and (4) contributed to different game designs.",,"Hussain, H.

It was occupied every summer field season, and occasionally over winter. In 1993 it was removed when the rising level of Lake Vanda threatened to flood the site. Vanda Station’s lifetime spanned a period of transition from little concern over environmental impacts in the Dry Valleys, to the beginning of the stringent code of conduct that is in place today. The legacy of environmental consequences can now provide unique insights into the lasting impacts of this mode of human activity on the Antarctic environment, and the ability of time, environmental change and human endeavour to remediate or amplify those effects.
The assessment of environmental impacts began just prior to the removal of the station in which specific sites of soil contamination, including an an area of routine greywater disposal in a gully beside the main buildings were identified. A second assessment was undertaken in 1997, on the partially remediated but still unflooded site, which identified discrete areas of residual chemical contamination particularly in “Greywater Gully”. The lake level has continued to rise and now, just over 20 years after its remediation, the station site has almost completely flooded. “Greywater Gully” is now under 3 - 4m of lake water.

This is based on the common assumption that P is almost entirely bound to suspended particulate material (SPM) in the run-off and immediate receiving waters. In this study, this assumption has been held up to scrutiny, using existing monitoring data for dissolved reactive P (DRP) and total P in the Te Waihora/Lake Ellesmere and Wairewa/Lake Forsyth catchments, and a geochemical modelling approach.
Long term monitoring data for the lakes1 confirms that P has indeed been predominantly bound to SPM in the water column (DRP averaged <10% of total P) over the monitoring period. However, in the tributaries there has been considerably more variability in the fractionation of P, and a higher proportion of DRP. In the Selwyn River, for example, DRP has made up (on average) 50% of the total P concentrations (38 yrs of monthly monitoring data1). In the LII River, DRP has made up 67% of the total P concentrations (19 years of monthly monitoring data1). In the smaller tributaries of Te Waihora, DRP has ranged from 34% (an average for creeks and streams) to 50% (an average for farm drains) of total P, over the 18 years that monitoring data has been collected by students of Lincoln and Canterbury universities2,3. Similar results have been observed in a recent 10 month survey of the tributaries of Wairewa, in which DRP averaged 30-60% of total P. During flood events the P fractionation has changed to favour a greater percentage of SPM-bound P in all tributaries monitored.
Using water chemistry and SPM compositions typical of these lake and tributary environments, the geochemical model PHREEQC has been used to determine principal controls on P binding to SPM. A sensitivity analysis approach was used to establish the role of variables such as the iron oxide content of the SPM, redox conditions, pH and the concentrations of competing ions such as SO4. The potential precipitation of P-phases such as Ca-, Fe- and Mn-phosphates was also considered. While the uptake of P by phytoplankton could not be represented in the geochemical model, the correlation between in total P and chlorophyll-a observed in the long term monitoring data from both lakes1 could be used, together with a mass balance approach, to predict the effect of phytoplankton growth on P fractionation.
It is proposed that this modelling approach can be used to predict the optimal conditions for P-binding to SPM, and therefore help identify the best options for retention and immobilisation of P, before it reaches important water features in a catchment.",,"Webster-Brown J.G., Waters A.S.

In recent years, data from government-administered social surveys and/or censuses have become a significant source of information. Using the tribal authority of Te Runanga o Ngai Tahu (TRONT) as a case study, this paper explores and compares data concerning Ngai Tahu wellbeing contained in two recently completed TRONT reports: the Ngai Tahu State of the Nation 2015 report (a quantitative study derived from government-administered survey data); and, the preliminary findings from the Ngai Tahu Whenua Project (a qualitative study undertaken by TRONT). Both studies present similar results regarding levels of tribal economic wellbeing, however, they show different results in regards to levels of cultural wellbeing. The qualitative study reveals reasonably high levels of cultural engagement among participants. Conversely, the quantitative study demonstrates reasonably low levels of cultural engagement. The difference is explained in each study’s approach to understanding culture. The quantitative study viewed culture as engagement in ‘static’ cultural practices, whereas the qualitative study viewed Maori culture as a ‘lived’ set of deep networks and connections between individuals, their whanau (extended family), and places of symbolic cultural importance (particularly land and water). It is argued that measuring ‘lived’ culture would provide a better means of ascertaining cultural wellbeing.

vasodilation/contraction models via the astrocytic mediated perivascular K+ and the smooth muscle cell
(SMC) Ca2+ pathway termed a neurovascular unit (NVU). Luminal agonists acting on P2Y receptors
on the endothelial cell (EC) surface provide a flux of inositol trisphosphate (IP3) into the endothelial
cytosol. This concentration of IP3 is transported via gap junctions between EC and SMC providing a
10 source of sacroplasmic derived Ca2+ in the SMC. The model is able to relate a neuronal input signal
to the corresponding vessel reaction (contraction or dilation). A tissue slice consisting of blocks, each
of which contain an NVU is connected to a space filling H-tree, simulating a perfusing arterial tree
(vasculature) The model couples the NVUs to the vascular tree via a stretch mediated Ca2+ channel
on both the EC and SMC. The SMC is induced to oscillate by increasing an agonist flux in the EC
15 and hence increased IP3 induced Ca2+ from the SMC stores with the resulting calcium-induced calcium
release (CICR) oscillation inhibiting NVC thereby relating blood flow to vessel contraction and dilation
following neuronal activation. The coupling between the vasculature and the set of NVUs is relatively
weak for the case with agonist induced where only the Ca2+ in cells inside the activated area becomes
oscillatory however, the radii of vessels both inside and outside the activated area oscillate (albeit small
20 for those outside). In addition the oscillation profile differs between coupled and decoupled states with
the time required to refill the cytosol with decreasing Ca2+ and increasing frequency with coupling. The
solution algorithm is shown to have excellent weak and strong scaling. Results have been generated for

In New Zealand, Māori tribal enterprises are engaged in the food producing sectors of farming and fisheries and, like other businesses seeking to remain competitive in global markets, are responding to the demand for provenance through developing systems for communicating the origin of foods to consumers. However, Māori are doing this in their own way, in a manner that authentically reflects their own understanding of place and expresses an indigenous animist perspective. It is argued that an animist approach to provenancing provides an authentic means of connecting Western consumers to nature in circumstances where they have become psychologically and physically abstracted. Animism provides a relational way of understanding the world, through which food products emerge as animated representations of reciprocal place-based relationships. It is considered that this indigenous approach can provide ‘an antidote’ to the alienating effects of modernity, where food products are experienced as inert compositions of elements that can be replicated and produced anywhere via industrial processes. Furthermore, it can provide a touchstone for differentiating between authentic provenance and the cynical use of provenance marketing that exploits the needs of alienated individuals for connection to place.

However, these terms have to be considered critically, and careful reflection on their meaning is needed in each context where they are used (Soutter, Gilmore & O’Steen 2011). One reflection in the context of education has been conducted in relation to positive psychology as well as philosophical concepts and questions such as how to live a good life, the art of living and especially Schmid’s (2000) concept of Lebenskunst or ‘art of living’ (Teschers 2013). Still, the research undertaken to connect these concepts with the area of early childhood education in particular has been rather limited. The current paper is one step to bridge this gap by exploring how the concept of the art of living relates to early childhood education and the notion of well-being as it is used in the New Zealand early childhood curriculum Te Whāriki (Ministry of Education 1996). It is proposed that early childhood educators can support the development of children’s abilities to enable them to engage actively in shaping their own lives and developing their own art of living earlier rather than later in their lives. Further, suggestions are made for teaching practice about ways early childhood educators can support young children to become reflective, autonomous and knowledgeable human beings, who are able to take responsibility for their own lives.",,"Teschers C (2016).

In this article we argue that through dramaturgical play in combination with pedagogical tools such as the Community of Inquiry (CoI), in the tradition of Philosophy for Children (P4C), students can creatively think, reflect and be more aware of the impact their gestures have on others. One of the most fundamental aspects of the embodied human life is human interaction that is based on expressions, what Schmid calls gestures. Through self-reflection, one’s set of gestures can be developed into a deliberate ‘life-performance’ – a conscious, selected and coherent work of art. Drawing on Nietzsche’s idea of living artistically, we explore how Schmid’s philosophy of the art of living, P4C and the liberal arts, with a focus on drama education, can work together to help children develop their own art of living while respecting and supporting the development of the good and beautiful life of others.",,"D'Olimpio L, Teschers C (2017).

and low-damage response characteristics. Rocking actions in these members arise from the open-and-close action
at their two end joints. A post-tensioned prestressing tendon passing through the members and the joints provides the axial
and moment continuity between the members and the joints. Rocking at member interior joints may also be provided for
segmental rocking members, which are usually used as bridge piers. Because the plane sections of the rocking members at
the joints do not remain plane during the rocking action, the traditional beam-column finite elements based on classical
plane-section beam theories are no longer applicable to simulate the rocking motions. As a result, a new type of beamcolumn
finite element is needed. In this paper, a new rocking beam-column element is proposed. The new element allows
multiple rocking joints to be anywhere within the beam-column members, and, therefore, is applicable to both traditional
end rocking members and segmental rocking members. It is derived based on the mixed formulation that interpolates the
force field exactly but satisfies the strain-displacement compatibility weakly. The formulation allows the relaxation of
plane-section assumption at the rocking joints using the idea of multispring models. The new element can be readily used to
simulate the seismic response of a large-scale structures with multiple rocking beams and columns. The new element
accurately simulates the experimental results of a rocking column undergone a series of bi-axial loading. To demonstrate its
advantages in large-scale simulations, the new element is also used to model the dynamic response of a large-scale
structure. The results indicate that this new element shows highly promising potentials for large-scale structural analysis.",,"Lee CL (2017).

For the purposes of the project, part-time work is defined as a form of employment which carries fewer hours per week than a full-time job. A flexible work arrangement is defined as an arrangement where an employee benefits from working practices that offer different degrees of structure, regularity and flexibility. Such arrangements may include the ability to choose the start and finishing time of the working day or compressed work weeks.

In November 2015 the Canterbury and Westland Branch of the Law Society, on behalf of the project team, invited all qualified lawyers practicing in the Canterbury and Westland area to participate in a short online survey examining flexible and part-time working arrangements. An invitation was also sent to all legal executives working in the same area. 

One hundred and thirty eight responses were received and over 90% of these were from female lawyers and legal executives. Although lower participation rate by males is reported in other studies focusing on the legal profession, the gender split in the responses in this project was far more pronounced, suggesting a lack of interest by local male lawyers in this issue. 

Survey participants were either practising lawyers or legal executives, with legal executives making up 21% of the survey cohort. Fifteen percent of the cohort identified as employers. Ninety six percent of the employee cohort was working on a permanent contract of employment.

Focus groups held with Pacific audiences at several urban centres in New Zealand found that Pacific news media are a key site of Pacific people’s publicness in New Zealand. Audiences looked to Pacific media (and, interestingly, Māori media) to fulfil their expectations for timely, in-depth and high-quality journalism, and for a space in which their communities could safely discuss issues and enact their citizenship. However, it is clear that more could be done to realise this role, not just on the part of Pacific media producers, but also funders and policy makers whose focus on Pacific media in terms of ethnicity and culture tends to overlook audiences’ demand for in-depth news and debate. This paper concludes that viewing ethnic media within categories of ethnicity or culture (as do funders, scholars and, often, media producers) risks both exaggerating the ‘otherness’ of ethnic minority groups and overlooking Pacific audiences’ media needs in terms of their participation in society.

The swash zone is the area of the beach between the inner surfzone and backbeach that is intermittently submerged and exposed by the processes of wave uprush and backwash. Given the dominant role that swash plays in the morphological evolution of a beach, it is important to understand and quantify the main processes. The extent of swash (horizontally and vertically), current velocities and suspended sediment concentrations are all parameters of interest in the study of swash processes. In situ methods of measurements in this energetic zone were instrumental in developing early understanding of swash processes, however, the field has experienced a shift towards remote sensing methods.

These noises include (1) pressure-coupled (acoustic), (2) velocity-coupled (flow), and (3) external combustion noise. It is found that these three types of background noises play important, but different roles in changing the hysteresis width and stability boundary. In addition, the stochastic transition from stability to instability is investigated, as the noise intensity is varied. Two different stochastic P-bifurcations are identified. One is related to a craterlike probability density distribution. The other is associated with a probability density distribution characterized with two peaks and one trough. With each type of noise affecting the system's stochastic behaviors being evaluated, the effect of two different types of noises is then studied. It is shown that the combined noises (types 1 and 2) cannot only destabilize global stable thermoacoustic system, but also stabilize linearly unstable system. This depends strongly on the superimposition form of the two types of noises.

in controversy. It is important that New Zealand midwives and doctors have sufficient understanding
of the evidence to be able to effectively counsel women to make an informed decision when a baby
presents in a breech position at term.
Aims: To review the evidence and international guidance related to mode of birth for singleton
breech presentation at term, identify the current evidence and gaps in knowledge and highlight how
the evidence can be used to support women within the New Zealand context of maternity care.
Method: We searched Scopus, PubMed and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews for
peer reviewed publications about term breech presentation. The search terms used were ""breech
presentation"" and ""term"". Limiters were set for the time period between 2000 and 2015, English
language, human pregnancies, and peer reviewed journals.
Findings: We found 456 published papers covering breech presentation related to clinical outcomes,
professional commentaries, professional guidelines and the woman’s perspectives. We identified
and retrieved 37 papers as relevant to our search criteria. We report specifically on the papers that
provided professional commentary (detailed critique of the evidence), clinical studies, systematic
reviews, meta-analyses and professional guidelines.
Following the publication of the Term Breech Trial there was a change in practice to that of
recommending planned caesarean section for term breech presentation. Subsequent critiques and
reviews have identified concerns with the study which undermine its reliability. Further retrospective/
prospective studies, a systematic review and a meta-analysis have demonstrated equivocal results and
suggest that perinatal mortality during vaginal breech births can be reduced when strict criteria
are applied and an experienced clinician is involved. Many professional guidelines now advise that
offering women the option of a vaginal breech birth is reasonable.
Conclusion: New Zealand midwives and doctors need to be in a position to inform women with
breech presenting babies about factors that support the safety of vaginal breech birth, as well as about
the benefits and potential harms of both caesarean section and vaginal breech birth, to support their
decision making.",,,,"0114-7870",,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/15568",,"en",,"New Zealand College of Midwives",,,,,"https://www.midwife.org.nz/resources-events/issue-54","Field of Research::11 - Medical and Health Sciences::1114 - Paediatrics and Reproductive Medicine::111402 - Obstetrics and Gynaecology||Field of Research::11 - Medical and Health Sciences::1110 - Nursing::111006 - Midwifery",,"breech||term||birth||evidence||guidelines",,,"Singleton breech presentation at term: Review of the evidence and international guidelines for application to the New Zealand context",,,"Journal Article",,,,,
"18696","10092/13353","Visser R||Brown, K.R.",,,,,"2017","Streams and rivers are abundant in our plantation forests and the Forest Industry prides itself on protecting the intrinsic values they provide, including clean water and quality aquatic habitat. In ensuring they remain protected, the industry has both legal obligations through Resource Management Act and Regional Council requirements, as well as a professional obligation through Forest Accord agreements and the adoption of the NZFOA Environmental
Code of Practice (ECoP). It is well known that forest harvesting, including the development of roads and infrastructure, can compromise these waterway values. With the law being effects-based, a clear focus should be on concentrated flows of runoff and sediment to stream channels (aka ‘breakthroughs’) that are linked to our harvesting practices. Improved knowledge about breakthroughs can be used to prescribe site-specific best management
practices (BMPs) to protect water quality and aquatic habitat. To better understand how often breakthroughs occur and to identify and describe the most common breakthrough sources, the stream channels associated with 23 recent commercial forest harvests were surveyed. A breakthrough had to have the following characteristics to be
recorded: evidence of scour from surface runoff and/or a concentrated trail (pathway) of sediment that reached the stream channel. Overall, there were 3.4 breakthroughs per kilometre of stream, or one breakthrough for every
6.5 hectares of harvest area, which is almost identical to studies from the Piedmont region of the southeastern United States where they found one breakthrough for every 6 to 8 hectares of harvest area. In this study, ground-based logging was associated with nearly twice as many breakthroughs as cable logging (i.e. 6.2 versus 3.3 breakthroughs per kilometre of stream) due to more soil disturbance from trails near streams. Seventy-three percent of breakthroughs were associated with concentrated runoff from roads, trails, stream crossings, and machine
tracks on the hillslope. Road-stream crossing approaches delivered concentrated runoff to stream channels more
often if they were associated with log truck roads and/or surface runoff could travel long distances from the adjacent and uphill road segment to the stream. Log truck roads are compact by design to support heavy loads, whereas skid trails often retained some of the protective functions of the forest floor (i.e. higher infiltration capacity). Longer road drainage lengths are associated with greater runoff volumes and velocities, thus increasing the potential for hydrologic connectivity with the stream. Conversely, where skid trail approaches to stream crossings did lead to breakthroughs, potential erosion rates were 44 times higher than those of log truck roads at stream crossings.
This finding highlights the importance of closing skid trails properly upon harvest completion, especially at stream crossings. Installation of water bars and turnouts to control surface runoff and application of slash to skid trail approaches can be used to reduce the potential for sediment delivery at road-stream crossings. Overall, the level of protection provided to our waterways post-harvest is good. However, the majority of breakthroughs that were recorded could be directly attributed to operational activities and a more consistent adoption of BMPs, especially in the specific areas identified in this report, would reduce our impact even further. Common characteristics of breakthrough sources can include poor infiltration capacity, large quantities of exposed soil, and steep slopes. This project report provides specific examples (as observed in this study) of forestry practices used to reduce the frequency of sediment breakthroughs and their impacts on water quality and aquatic habitat, such as:  
Planning to locate roads away from streams, control road gradient and reduce
earthworks
Harvest planning to minimise tracking and stream crossings
Installation of road drainage structures to control water in small amounts and reduce
surface runoff velocity
Positioning of road drainage structures to avoid direct or indirect discharges to stream
channels
Closure of temporary road-stream crossings that includes both water control and
provisioning of immediate surface cover.",,"Brown, K.R., Visser, R (2017).
