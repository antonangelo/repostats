In relation to Māori health, policy in Aotearoa New Zealand is marked by fluctuations between policies of assimilation and policies that support the retention and development of Māori interests (Durie, 2005, p. 4).

Non-compliant drinking-water supplies place communities at increased risk of contracting waterborne pathogens such as hepatitis A, Campylobacter and Giardia (Ministry of Health, 2013). These pathogens contribute significantly to the burden of illness in rural communities. For example, monitoring undertaken by Northland Health (Project Waiora) in the late 1990s found persistent faecal coliform (Escherichia coli) transgressions in many Northland schools and marae (Auckland Regional Public Health Service, 2005). In 1998 a hepatitis A outbreak at a Hokianga marae, caused by contaminated drinking-water, required the vaccination of 800 people (New Zealand Public Health Report, 1999).
Despite the urgent public health need, no action was taken. There are several possible reasons for this: a lack of drinking-water treatment expertise in the local public health unit; safe drinking-water not being accorded priority, or funding by the Ministry of Health, due to its non-regulated nature (Mistry, 2012); a lack of political will to remedy the situation; and/or funding constraints being used to justify inaction (Jellie et al., 2003). 
For Hokianga hapū (sub-tribes), access to safe drinking-water is a community priority. A clean and healthy environment, and the ability to fulfill kaitiaki (environmental stewardship) responsibilities, is critical to whānau, hapū and iwi (family, sub-tribe and tribe) identity and wellbeing. For the past two decades, in the face of local authority inaction, local health provider Hokianga Health Enterprise Trust (HHET)/Hauora Hokianga has supported (ultimately successful) hapū efforts to improve community drinking-water supplies. These developments have shaped public policy, environmental health practice and understanding of community development throughout the country. In this chapter the case of small water-supply management in the Hokianga region will be explored, firstly to demonstrate the ways in which policy can be utilised by communities for gains unforeseen by policy-makers, and secondly to offer insights into the social policy/social work interface.",,,"Ahuriri-Driscoll, A., Foote, J.

Recently, Aotearoa/ New Zealand has seen a resurgence of interest from central government in implementing programmes for such young people that draw on military models of practise. The philosophy and format of adventure therapy programmes implemented by St John of God Waipuna in Otautahi/Christchurch Aotearoa/ New Zealand present a strong contrast to these military-style programmes. Evaluation of these programmes suggests that if adventure-based programmes are to be effective in developing young people and sustaining change, they must focus on developing all aspects of the young person.
This approach is grounded in building respectful and meaningful relationships among everyone involved with the programme, and that approach, in turn, is predicated on power sharing and taking responsibility for oneself. The over-arching aim is to give young people a sense of ownership. This is achieved by an intentional shift throughout the programme from dependence, through independence and on to interdependence. The paper interweaves consideration of these aspects, especially in terms of how they have informed the design and delivery of the Waipuna programmes, with various models of personal development and leadership, along with the self-reported narrative of a young person involved in one of these programmes.",,,"Jansen, C., Pawson, P.

For the indigenous Kanak population, however, the Accords have led to demobilisation, division and disillusionment in an independence movement that had shown considerable unity and strength.
This paper examines the political origins and consequences of the Accords and discusses concerns about the development model upon which they are based. It outlines the educational promises of the Matignon Accords which were devised in response to growing Kanak dissatisfaction with and mobilisation against French education.
The paper shows that, in the face of fundamental critiques Kanak people have made of French education in New Caledonia, the orientation of the territory's educational authority, the Vice-Rectorat, remains unchanged. It also highlights attempts by the Vice-Rectorat to downplay and even conceal the failure of the school system to address the underachievement of Kanak pupils.
The paper presents a critique of a number of educational and training initiatives that have been introduced in line with the Matignon Accords including the introduction of Kanak languages into the curriculum, the production of locally oriented school text books, the Programme d'Enrichissement Instrumental and Operation 400 Cadres. It argues that these programmes are an integral part of an approach to development that is leading not towards Kanak independence but to the strengthening of French control and influence in New Caledonia.",,,"Small, D.

It is the closest they have got to a retrospective rationalisation of the invasion that alienated them from many of their close allies and attracted widespread condemnation around the world. But it falls far short of a genuine justification because it was not the reason for attacking in the first place. The rationale for the invasion was that Saddam Hussein’s stockpile of weapons of mass destruction was a threat to the security of the entire region.
Critics doubted these claims and UN inspectors could not verify them. Still the US and its allies insisted they were absolutely true and acted accordingly. The US was eventually forced to concede that not a single WMD was found, let alone stockpiles of them.
The whole sorry affair raises a number of significant questions that will be explored in this paper. First, there are the issues of the accuracy of the intelligence upon which the US and its allies rely, and also about the nexus between those who generate the intelligence and those who deploy it to advance their political aims. These are matters that go to the heart of the War on Terror. It also raises issues about the genuine significance of weapons of mass destruction, a term in constant use before the invasion that has barely rated a mention since. It also raises questions about the relationship between fighting military wars and the more multi-dimensional and metaphorical war on terror. There is also the issue of the nature and strength of various alliances among the parties to the war on terror, an issue that will be discussed with reference to New Zealand, a country well down the military intelligence food-chain.",,"Small, D.

In the mid-eighties, the yacht used by the French commandos who blew up the Rainbow Warrior carried its name. In the late eighties, it was the scene of the bloodiest operation by a European army that the Pacific has seen since the end of World War Two. Today, the New Caledonian island of Ouvéa is fast developing a reputation as the cannabis capital of the Pacific.
Two-metre high hedges of the outlawed herb can be found as features in elaborate and carefully tended gardens around people's houses. In the village of St Joseph, a very healthy specimen is thriving in a sunny, well-drained plot between the street counter of the local shop and the ancient logs that surround the courtyard of the high chief Nekelo. It is so widely consumed that after every rainfall, stray seeds germinate where they fall - in people's lawns, driveways or gardens - and often they have already become sturdy little plants by the time they attract their first human eye.
In the rest of this French territory, cannabis is as illegal as it is in France. Possession of a single joint leads to arrest and a criminal conviction. But on Ouvéa the situation has got so out of hand that the best the authorities can hope for is to contain it by searching the bags of passengers arriving from Ouvéa at Nouméa's Magenta airport.

curriculum (NZC) requires individual schools to design curriculum to reflect the needs of their local communities through consultation with their communities. For most schools ‘consultation’ has meant keeping parents informed of developments the school
has decided. However, Southbridge School has adopted a more proactive and courageous approach inviting parental and student input at each step of the curriculum design process. Regular conversations about
learning have enabled parents, students and teachers to work as partners to shape the evolving curriculum. Such conversations closely mirror the action research cycles
of plan, act, develop and reflect to show parents and students that their contributions matter. This paper addresses one aspect of this partnership, the students’
contributions referred to as student voice and participation in the literature. The paper will highlight the value of student voice, the strategies adopted by Southbridge School to seek student voice and suggest
future possibilities. Data for the paper are drawn from two student engagement surveys, focus group interviews with students and observations of student participation in
curriculum development meetings. This paper is an account of how the school has developed its local curriculum, (named the 2020Vision project), to attract and sustain student voice in its development. Attention
to the student voice is believed to be critical if schools are to equip students with the knowledge, competencies and values needed for citizenship in the twenty-first

"16290","10092/459",,,"Theys C||McAuliffe MJ",,,,,,,,"2017",,,"In the last decade, research on motor speech disorders has increasingly taken into account
the bidirectionality between speaker and listener. Listening to disordered speech (e.g., dysarthria)
may result in substantial phonemic uncertainty. In turn, a larger set of potential word target
candidates may be activated—contributing to intelligibility deficits. To resolve this uncertainty, a
combination of both bottom-up and top-down processes are thought to play a role (Liss, 2007). The
goal of the present study was to investigate the contribution of these processes by analysing
listeners’ neurophysiological processing when listening to dysarthric speech.
Thirty healthy native English speakers (12 males, 18-44 years) participated in a speech
perception experiment while undergoing 32-channel EEG recording. Similarly to Obleser and Kotz
(2011), we focused on the auditory N100 as a marker for earlier sensory processing and the N400-
like peak representing information on later cognitive-linguistic processes. Participants listened to 55
moderate hypokinetic dysarthric sentences and 55 control sentences. The experiment was repeated
one week later to investigate the effects of repeated exposure to disordered speech. The amplitudes
and latencies of the event-related potentials over Cz were analysed.
Repeated measures GLM statistics of the N100 with speech type (dysarthria vs. control) and test
session as independent variables showed a main effect of speech type, with increased amplitude
(Fampl(28)=12.18, p<.01) and decreased latency (Flat(28)=6.77, p=.02) when listening to dysarthric
versus control speech. There was no significant main effect of test session or interaction effect. In
contrast, no significant effects of speech type and test session were observed on the amplitude of
the N400-like peak. For latency, only a significant interaction effect was present (Flat(28)=4.16,
p=.05), evidenced by decreased latency for dysarthric sentences during the first test session, and the
reverse during the second session.
The N100 results show that the quality of the auditory signal in naturally degraded dysarthric
speech influences early sensory auditory processing, indicating an increase in the initial allocation of
neurophysiological resources (Obleser & Kotz, 2011). The N400 latency results show that later, more
cognitive-linguistic processes are not only influenced by the degradation of the signal itself but also
by the amount of exposure to that signal, a finding consistent with previous behavioural research on
dysarthric speech (Borrie et al., 2012).",,,"Theys C, McAuliffe MJ (2017). Listening to disordered speech results in early modulations of auditory event-related potentials.

Our objective is to discuss the research evidence behind one of the conclusions drawn from data gathered during a series of six programmes in leadership learning called Principals as Literacy Leaders (PALL). That conclusion highlights the power of blended leadership learning. We argue that blended leadership learning requires a combination of generic leadership skills with pedagogical content knowledge. In other words, a blend of process and content, the how with the what. Both are considered necessary if principals are to connect their daily work more directly with teacher and student learning. We use the term blended learning quite differently from the way it is usually applied with e-learning strategies. There, the tendency is to concentrate on delivery processes combining virtual with real-time interactive means (Dempster, 2016).",,,"Dempster N, Lovett S, Townsend T, Bayetto A, Johnson G, Stevens E (2017).

The latter two studies used a multiple baseline design and intervention consisted of the use of VSM (including animation to depict in-toilet urination), prompting, and reinforcement. In Study 2 both participants acquired the steps in the toileting sequence however, one participant began using the toilet appropriately prior to introducing the video. Study 3 extended upon previous findings by including animation to depict in-toilet defecation and requests to use the toilet within the VSM. Results suggest the intervention package was effective in teaching the sequence of behaviors, as well as in-toilet urination to both children.

"14458","10092/459",,,"Culpan, I.||Bruce, J.",,,,,,,,"2013",,,"Physical education (PE) in New Zealand/Aotearoa (NZ) has recently undergone some seismic conceptual shifts. This came from the introduction of a socio-critical orientated Health and Physical Education curriculum in 1999.This curriculum required PE teachers to re-think programmes to:
-	Promote learning of new skills associated in, through and about physical activity and sport and
-	Enhance, extend, inform and critique the deliberate use of play, exercise, sport and physical activity.
The new socio-critical curriculum fostered a 21stC view of learning that promoted students (5 year olds to 18 years) being active, virtuous and critical consumers of the movement culture.
The socio-critical orientation for PE necessitated PE teachers to examine alternative visions to what it might mean to be physically educated and to seek alternative pedagogical understandings and practices to acknowledge the emergent strong socio-ecological perspective. Emerging from this has been the implementation of a number of overseas social constructivist PE pedagogical models. Recent developments, unique to NZ, have seen the development of culturally responsive pedagogical models that seek to address the NZ Curriculum’s socio-critical intent – these are;
1.	Te Ao Kori – a cultural contextualisation of a Maori celebration of life through movement. Recent research indicates the uptake of this model is happening but concern exists that many non-Maori teachers show reluctance because of its strong cultural orientation.
2.	Olympism Education – where the life principles of Olympism are fostered, practised and critiqued to promote a virtuous critical consumer of active lifestyles 
3.	A Critical Analysis Process Model that seeks to redress the theory/practice nexus across the movement culture. The developers of this model report on its usefulness and practicality particularly at the senior school level.
While the intent of this socio-critical curriculum is yet to achieve its potential a small group of NZ scholars are beginning to move into a ‘post’ conceptualisation of PE and further develop programmes to suit 21stC learners – this is a challenge.  The development of the three pedagogical models and futurist considerations will be showcased",,,"Culpan, I., & Bruce, J.

The concept of movement, whether one understands it as a social construct or originating from an innate ability, is central to 21st Century living.  Indeed contemporary understandings of physical activity acknowledge that one of its important functions is in the maintenance of health and the development of healthy lifestyles. However this acknowledgement has become far too simplistic, evidenced by the popular and proliferated media  and corporate  messages and programmes constructed and designed to facilitate individual and collective health – most of which is focused on claiming to address and solve the ‘obesity and physical inactivity crisis’ with young people.
Resulting from this particular health focus, which has as its central message ‘ energy in and energy out balance’, is the degradation of the educative and social  value of physical activity and physical education, particularly in schools.  Instead of promoting a holistic view and capturing the educative and social value of physical activity and physical education justifications for such programmes are more and more reliant on rationalising physical activity and physical education as having a  primary purpose of obesity reduction. This paper argues that given this focus, young people are at risk of being denied learning opportunities which may result in impoverished physical activity and physical education understandings and experiences.  More specifically this presentation will:
•	Highlight how some simplistic health messages, particularly around addressing obesity concerns, maybe counter-productive to the overall health and physical education learning of our young people. 
•	Stress the need to capture the health benefits of physical activity and physical education in a more holistic and critical manner.

The program was supported by six Leadership Mentors.These mentors were principals with knowledge and practical involvement with the types of schools and communities participating in the PALLIC project. Their main role was to help each of the schools complete the modules’ follow up tasks.The general research aim of PALLIC was to document the impact and effects of each school's leadership team's actions in implementing the required follow up reading improvement tasks. Data sources included the principals’ personal leadership profiles, surveys for Principals, Teachers, Leadership Mentors and Indigenous Leadership Partners and case studies from 7 schools (involving site visits by 2 researchers accompanied by the Leadership Mentors) and an analysis of reading action plan reports from each school.
I draw upon data from one of these case study schools to highlight the impact and effects of attempts to implement leadership for reading ‘both ways’. I interrogate what it means for a school to engage in ‘both ways’ leadership and create a new intercultural space where both cultures (home and school) are linked, listening and learning from each other. The rationale for ‘both ways’ leadership is that leadership for student achievement in schools with high Indigenous enrolments must connect with and include parents and community members in decisions about their children’s learning. This is not only about informing parents about what they can do to help their children but rather recognising that teachers and parents have wisdom and knowledge they can share with one another for the benefit of student learning.",,,"Lovett, S (2016) Leading reading in a remote Indigenous school.

The town/gown relationship was aloof and strained due to UC’s move from the CBD in the 1970s and students being seen as troublemakers. Despite its vision of people prepared to make a difference, the University’s students and staff were not seen as making a difference in the local community or as being engaged citizens.
 This changed when over 9,000 UC students mobilized themselves into the Student Volunteer Army to provide immediate relief across Christchurch following the four major quakes of 2010 and 2011. Suddenly, UC students were seen as saviors, not miscreants and a focus on citizenship education as part of the University’s strategic direction began to take shape.
 Based on qualitative and quantitative research conducted at UC over the past four years, this interactive presentation will highlight the findings, conclusions, and implications of how the University has been transformed into a recognized, international leader in citizenship education. By integrating students’ community service into their academic studies, the University has changed its persona while students have gained academically, civically, and personally.",,,"O'Steen, B.

The dichotomy of the ‘nature-culture divide’ (Vaisman, 2013) punctuates the lived experiences of Māori adopted within New Zealand between 1955 and 1985, in several ways. The ‘closed stranger’ adoption process sought a ‘clean break’ between birth family and child, promoting the supremacy of environment and socialisation over biology, nurture over nature (Griffith, 1997). However, the engineering of new adoptive kinship relationships as if they were biological (Delany, 1997), simultaneously dissolved and mimicked ‘natural’ ties, placing adoptive families in the position of producing the very differences they were constructed to deny, and adoptees in a situation of “irresolvable contradictions” (Yngvesson & Mahoney, 2000, p. 83; Blake, 2013). 

According to several writers, identity provides the coherence sought by adoptees in the face of biological/social ‘rupture’ (Haenga Collins, 2011; Yngvesson & Mahoney, 2000). For Māori adoptees, reconnecting with birth whānau (family) and whakapapa (genealogy) holds the promise of identity fulfillment, legitimacy and perhaps even ‘authenticity’. This too can be fraught, as the fragmentation perpetuated by adoption is not easily reconciled with the emphasis on integrity and wholeness of whānau and continuity of whakapapa in the Māori world (Ministerial Advisory Committee, 1988; Bradley, 1997). Furthermore, adoptees may find that their claim to biological ties nonetheless falls short of the upbringing within Māori community that is integral to Māori identity and personhood (Kāretu, n.d., Durie, 1997, cited in Newman, 2011). 

Caught between a dualism of essentialism and constructionism (Woodward, 1997), the Māori adoptee identity ‘project’ is complex and has the potential to yield important insights relating to identity (West, 2012). This presentation will outline current PhD research that is exploring Māori adoptee identities as they are constructed ‘in between’ (Collins, 1999; Waters, 2004; Webber, 2008; Yngvesson & Mahoney, 2000), from experience (Alcoff, 2010) and as resources (Wieland, 2010).",,,"Ahuriri-Driscoll, A (2016) The main divide - nature/culture dualisms and the Maori adoptee.

"14459","10092/459",,,"Culpan, I.",,,,,,,,"2015",,,"Sport needs a balanced and inter-disciplinary approach between sport’s educative, social and scientific value and the political economy. This paper argues that the possible meanings of sport for the individual and contemporary society, at whatever level, needs to be conceptualised predominately from a human development perspective.  This is sports major purpose - enhancing the human condition, if healthy active living is a desired outcome. Inherent in this purpose is the imperative for the State to manage the constraints of scientific functionalism of commercialisation, the commodification of sport and the objectification of the athlete. Contemporary sport is confronted by potentially deviant and destructive forces when scientism dominates sport discourse.  The emphasis on winning, the reduction of sport to physical performance and the quest for extrinsic rewards for the athlete and the political economy shakes and fractures the foundations of sport being a “valued human practice”.  The State needs to manage this, embrace and articulate a more educative and socio-cultural function of sport that integrates a holism based on enhancing the human condition.  The philosophy of neo Olympism provides a possible systematic way forward. This presentation will provide a contemporary and conceptual framework upon which sport, at all levels can build upon the philosophy of Olympism. It will do this by: 
•	critically examining dominant thinking around sport and the State’s role;
•	arguing for the educative, social, scientific and moral base of sport to be inculcated into school physical education and sports based programmes 
•	highlighting the need for Olympism to be more broadly promoted as a way of life to active healthy living  through balanced development of the person, celebrating the  joy in effort; promoting  the educative value of role modelling and the observance of an integrated set of universal ethics.",,,"Culpan, I.

My specific focus is on teenage mothers: the 'teenage mother' signifier is, by default, a negative one. Working with the academic literature on teenage parenting, Deleuzian concepts and empirical research undertaken in Australia, I look to trouble this signifier by focusing on teenage parents, and schools, through a lens of 'becoming'. Becoming a parent, becoming-parent, is a very powerful threshold to cross (at whatever age it occurs). When the parenting threshold is crossed in the context of schools profound, enduring tensions are brought into play which challenge the limits of signifiers such as 'school,' 'teacher,' 'school girl,' 'adult' and 'child' signifiers that are created and sustained by the habitual operation of what Massumi (1992) refers to as The World As We Know It.

The aim of this study was to identify the current behaviour management strategies used by seven teachers at a preschool and to examine the effects of training these teachers in the effective use of positive teaching strategies to increase appropriate behaviour and decrease disruptive behaviour in three and a half to five year old children. A variety of methodologies were employed including direct observation, the use of a rating scale and reflective teacher questionnaires. The results indicate that the teachers’ initial understanding of strategies such as contingent praise and attention were limited and that they would benefit from an in-service training programme focused on teaching positive behavioural strategies. After training, all teachers increased their use of descriptive praise and they increased their contingent responses following child requests. This increase in teacher behaviour was accompanied by an increase in child appropriate behaviour and a decrease in child disruptive behaviour.  These results raise a number of important implications for teachers.  These implications will be discussed and audience involvement at this time is actively encouraged.",,,"Phillips, J., Tyler-Merrick, G.

prevailing educational usage of videos is based on watching prepared videos, which calls for
accompanying video usage with activities to promote constructive learning. In the Active Video
Watching (AVW) approach, learner engagement during video watching is induced via
interactive notetaking, similar to video commenting in social video-sharing platforms. This
coincides with the JuxtaLearn practice, in which student-created videos were shared on a social
networking platform and commented by other students. Drawing on the experience of both
AVW and JuxtaLearn, we combine and refine analysis techniques to characterise learner
engagement. The approach draws on network-text analysis of learner-generated comments as a
basis. This allows for capturing pedagogically relevant aspects of divergence, convergence and

Study Design: Qualitative research using Nvivo analysis was utilised.
Place and Duration of the Study: The research took place at the University of Canterbury, Christchurch, New Zealand between July and October, 2014.
Methodology: The sample included 21 students enrolled in a sexuality education course.
 The majority of students were health education majors in the Bachelor of Health Sciences degree. All students completed pre- and post-course questionnaires and a random sample of the students were also selected to participate in focus group discussions. Students were questioned regarding their understanding of sexuality, their perceptions of sexuality issues facing New Zealanders, and changes in their ideas about sexuality education resulting from the course.
Results: Data analysis of the pre-course questionnaires and focus groups found students understandings and beliefs regarding sexuality education were mainly situated within a biomedical paradigm emphasizing the physical aspects of an individual’s sexuality. Post-course data suggested a shift towards a more holistic understanding of sexuality, the development and appreciation of a broader understanding of sexuality issues facing New Zealanders, and a marked paradigm shift in ideas around the concept of sexuality. 
Conclusion: This study demonstrates that sexuality education programmes framed within a holistic paradigm and underpinned by sound pedagogical practices have the potential to facilitate an expansion of ideas and attitudes about the construction of sexuality education",,,"Cushman, P., Brown Hajdukova, E., Clelland, T.

Forty-eight schools with significant proportions of Indigenous children were involved. At least half were in very remote Indigenous communities in central Australia where most children were not meeting national benchmarks in literacy. The project was designed to enhance principals’ literacy leadership capabilities, but particularly so in partnership with local Indigenous people. This course of action was taken following a focussed review of scholarly writing and empirical research into leadership and literacy learning with Indigenous people (Bishop and Berryman, 2011; Priest et al, 2008; McNaughton and Lye, 2009). Taking account of the findings of Priest et al. (2008) and Frawley and Fasoli (2012), a model of leadership ‘both ways’ was proposed, bringing together a principal and at least two Indigenous Leadership Partners as a team in each of the project schools. This leadership partnership underpinned the project through the partners’ participation in a shared professional learning program. The hope was that they would work together locally, to engage teachers, parents and community members in supporting children learning to read.   
One year on, principals and their ILPs were surveyed to gather views about the leadership actions the project had brought into prominence.  In the body of the article, we explain the research purposes on which the study was centred, the survey methods and items used.  Two survey instruments were administered, one online with principals, the other ‘face-to-face’ in print form with principals and ILPs.  
A discussion of the results highlights the growth of partnership relationships between principals and their ILPs and the difficulties in extending the benefits of their collaborative work beyond the school. The findings are used to problematize the efficacy of a ‘both ways’ model of leadership and to put forward issues for the further study of school leadership with local Indigenous people. The overall conclusion reached suggests that on matters as important as literacy learning which is so subject to home and community influences, leadership approaches need to be turned ‘inside-out’ – that is, action on literacy considered important by parents and community members must be brought to bear on literacy leadership within the school – circumstances not yet the case.",,,"Dempster, N., Lovett, S.

It involved 48 primary schools across 3 Australian States and territories in 2011 and 2012 with high Indigenous enrolments. The schools were both remote Indigenous schools and those in urban and regional settings. The project's design included a professional development program of five modules and on- and off-site visits by leadership mentors for principals and two local Indigenous partners over 18 months as well as research on its impact.  Data were collected and analysed at each phase of the program to inform its subsequent development. The focus for this conference paper is to discuss the project's impact on the participants and their work to establish a two-way leadership partnership around literacy learning, specifically in the teaching of reading. The project included an enabling element in its design, namely the inclusion of indigenous leadership partners (ILPs) from the schools' communities. This was in response to findings from existing research work (Priest, King, Nangala, Nungurrayi Brown & Nagala, 2008) claiming that full partnerships between homes and schools enhanced children's learning. The intent of the PALLIC project was an attempt to translate this ideal into the context of Indigenous communities where this was known to be more difficult because of constraints of language, staff turnover and separation of the worlds of home and school. The survey items related to the project's intent provide indicative data to highlight progress made towards establishing a strong reading program through the development of a leadership for learning partnership.",,,"Lovett, S., Dempster, N., Fluckiger, B.

The nurturing of a child’s proclivity to participate in organised sport normally falls into the domain of adults. While both parents and coaches have been identified as key influences on children’s enjoyment of sport, some negative perceptions exist about their roles. Although children’s perspectives are increasingly being acknowledged as valuable, it would appear that young children are still marginalised as active participants in areas of health related research. The primary objective of this study was to give space to children’s views of organised sport and to examine how adult behaviours affected these children’s enjoyment of sport. This qualitative study utilised eight focus group interviews with a total of 30 children (aged 6-11 years) in the Greater Auckland area of New Zealand. This paper presents a Foucauldian discourse analysis of children’s views relating to their sporting experiences. Children articulated three discursive constructions of sport: sport as competition, sport as fun and sport as fair play. The dominance of sport as competition would appear to serve the needs of coaches and parents more than those of children. Coaches who appear to be firmly positioned within a competitive discourse of sport use their power to support coaching practices that clash with the guidelines provided for them by their sporting bodies. Our analysis shows that many children may be exposed to discursive practices that are not conducive to a child-centred sporting environment. Through the exercise of disciplinary measures, there is pressure on children to conform to the normative behaviours associated with a dominant competitive sport discourse.",,,"Walters, S.R., Payne, D., Schluter, P.J., Thomson, R.W.

When professionals from different areas learn ‘with, from and about’ each other interprofessionally, they develop a shared understanding of their different areas, which facilitates their practicing together. Inter-professional learning facilitates inter-professional practice, which is key to creating collaborative communities for integrated education practices. This presentation outlines a national specialist teacher post-graduate program funded partly by the Ministry of Education as part of their vision of a fully inclusive education system and includes seven areas of specialization: Deaf; Autism Spectrum Disorder; Blind and Low Vision; Complex Educational Needs; Early Intervention; Gifted and Talented; and Learning and Behaviour.
Purpose
This presentation outlines a particular approach used for educating specialist teachers of the deaf – whereby they learn alongside other professionals within an interprofessional Community of Practice. 
Method
There is no one right way when it comes to professional learning and development. This presentation provides data from this inter-professional approach to Deaf Education that aims to facilitate the development of professional identities through integrating both specialist and interprofessional learning. 
Results 
Results from the first two graduating cohorts of this program indicate that when teachers and other professionals work in inter-professional ways, they feel increasingly competent and the outcomes for all learners are more positive.
Conclusion
Examining the inter-professional collaborative approach may lead to a change in thinking about what effective teacher of the deaf education looks like in the 21st century.",,,"Powell, D.R., van Bysterveldt, A., Mentis, M.

design of this study used mixed methods including a national survey as well as classroom
observations and interviews with teachers and students. The study has identified how a focus
on content knowledge and more “traditional” teaching approaches tends to discourage
students to progress with physics.",,,"Buabeng, I., Conner, L., Winter, D. (2015) The lack of physics teachers: “Like a bath with the plug out and the tap half on”.

In this paper three dimensions of learning are explored as a tool to assess aspects of technology education in the upper early childhood and lower primary school sectors.
In the New Zealand primary sector there are times when students might have achieved at one level but are not ready to move to a higher achievement level. When teaching and assessing technology, teachers rely curriculum and supporting documentation to assist with formative assessment. 
Technology education in the New Zealand early childhood sector is not as well-structured or defined as in primary, although students are given opportunities to recognise, use, make and evaluate technology across five strands in the Early Childhood Curriculum. Students are assessed in a range of dispositions but are not formally assessed in technology education. However, teachers may look for ways to extend students’ understanding of our technological world.
This paper offers a way to broaden and deepen student learning without necessarily moving them to higher curriculum achievement levels by offering a tool to assist teachers giving feedback as a part of the formative assessment process in technology education. It is envisaged that this paper will precede empirical research on ways to broaden and deepen young students’ understanding in technological literacy in both sectors.",,,"Fox-Turnbull, W.H.

New Zealand that promised the indigenous Māori that their language and culture would be
protected, these rights to autonomy and self-determination have not been fully realised. The
persistent gap in the education system’s responsiveness to Māori educational aspirations and
well-being poses a significant social justice challenge to educators, in particular teacher
educators. In order to successfully respond to the educational needs of Māori as tangata
whenua (the ‘people of the land’ or indigenous peoples of Aotearoa New Zealand) teacher
educators must develop the necessary sociocultural knoweldge and culturally-responsive
pedagogies to enact the fullness of their professional responsibilities as treaty partners with
Māori. By focusing on the indigenous context of teacher education in Aotearoa New Zealand,
we seek to illuminate a particular aspect of this complexity as a means to extend and
problematise the discourse around international teacher educator knowledge and practice with
respect to issues of diversity, culturally responsive practice, and social justice. In undertaking
this inquiry, we draw from a larger qualitative investigation examining the perspectives of a
small group of teacher educators regarding their understandings of the treaty in relation to
their educational practice. Our analysis is informed by critical theory (Giroux, 2007;
Kincheloe, 2008) and the notion of ‘teachers as gatekeepers” (Thornton, 1991, p 238).",,,"Stark R, Fickel LH (2015).

of different specialist IT (information technology) courses shows that gender identity is a potent factor in their
experiences. At a personal level, individual students, males and females, construe their experiences of CPS
(computer studies) and TIM (text and information management) courses differently. However, students tend to think
of different computer activities as masculine and feminine practices. They imbue courses with masculine and
feminine identities, depending on the type of computer applications, knowledge and skills that are emphasised in the
courses. These are socially defined notions of computing activity as gendered practice. Also, students’ experiences
are tied up with ideas about what sort of computer practices are consistent with their developing and personal
identities as male and female students of IT and computer users. This has implications and raises questions for those
who are concerned with a perceived ‘problem’ in the under representation of females in computer science and related
courses. It suggests that the ‘problem’ is more complex than it may initially appear.",,,"Abbiss, J. (2005) Gender identity and meaning making in specialist IT classes.

delivery was assigned one pitch position from a matrix of 18 possible width (line) and

one of ten regions on the field, based on the directional angle the ball travelled after being
hit. Each of these regions corresponds to a specific cricket fielding position. Furthermore,
each delivery was further classified by several variables that influence its resultant
position, including the handedness of both the bowler and batsmen, the bowlers type
classification (fast, medium, off spin, leg spin), and the side of the wicket the bowler

This qualitative study investigated the quality of the teaching-learning environment for three new entrant boys with Down Syndrome (DS) at mathematics during their first term at school. Two boys

boys were observed using continuous narrative recordings during their mathematics

The boys were frequently praised for task-engagement, despite evidence that they had not actually understood the concepts. The teachers’ foci centred mostly on praising for task engagement and for obtaining correct answers as opposed to the underlying processes.

on variation theory and social learning theory to describe how blended learning can
facilitate learning experiences which occur across the boundaries, and at the intersections,
of communities. The data is drawn from a preliminary analysis of a project investigating the
connections between online learning and teachers’ communities of practice. The emerging
premise is that teachers (as learners) negotiate much of the ‘blend’ themselves as they work
simultaneously in their school communities and engage in online learning communities.
While the online learning community provides the experiences of variation necessary to
provoke reflection and engagement with new ideas, teachers situate their learning within
their daily practice. This authentic participation is an integral part of the workplace learning
experience but this aspect is often overlooked in blended learning discussions. Higher
education institutions offering virtual professional development programmes would benefit
from leveraging learners’ participation in everyday work as a valuable ingredient in the
blended learning experience. Online professional development can adopt a thoughtfully
designed blend of mode and environment incorporating virtual and real interaction, and

activity through their support, encouragement, provision of opportunities to participate and through parents’
own involvement in physical activity is well documented.
A pilot physical activity project was trialled in 15 primary schools in Christchurch and Auckland, New
Zealand, with the aim to increase the quality and quantity of children’s physical activity and physical
education. To achieve these objectives physical activity co-ordinators were assigned to four schools each and
lead teachers were identified in each school to undergo a professional development programme to improve
their capabilities to develop and implement a quality physical education programme. Part of the evaluation of
this project was to investigate parents’ perceptions and attitudes to their children’s involvement in physical
activity and physical education and the changes in these perceptions and attitudes as a result of this
intervention.
A parent and caregivers questionnaire developed by the Australian Council for Health, Physical Education &
Recreation was completed on two occasions, at the baseline (term 1, 2003) and post intervention phase (term
4, 2004) of the data collection process and completed by 336 parent/caregivers (73% return rate).
Baseline results indicated that parent’s highly valued the place of physical activity in the school environment
and the health benefits and social skills that physical activity provides. Respondents indicated that family, the
school and enjoyment of the activity were key factors in continued participation in physical activity for
children. Barriers to participation were family and work commitments and cost of activities.
Analysis of specific groups post intervention indicated an improvement in attitude towards physical
education programmes and an increase in the influence of friends (low decile) and role of sports clubs (NZ
European) in physical activity participation.
These changes post intervention in parents’ perceptions may be reflective of the impact of the physical
activity co-ordinators who endeavoured to improve school and community links and of the professional
development for lead teachers.",,,"Cowley, V., Hamlin, M., Grimley, M., Hargreaves, J., Price, C.

transparency, accountability and collaborative practice within education. While
famous philosophers and theorists of the past including Plato, Rousseau and Dewey

more recent times with the spread of constructivism that authenticity has gained more

Results indicated that the boys with Down Syndrome (DS) engaged in a narrower range of roles than the typically developing boys at preschool. Essentially, they were included in level 1 type inclusion (interactions that did not involve any emotional connections with specific children). However, observations at school indicated that inclusion or exclusion were not within-child characteristics, but largely dependent on the context. By the end of the first week of school, one child with DS was actively included in the full range of roles characteristic for that setting (levels 1 and 2 inclusion). Furthermore, one typically developing child who experienced both forms of inclusion at preschool was excluded at school. He experienced mostly interactions
characteristic of level 1 type of inclusion at school. The data suggest that the nature
of relationships in each context affected inclusion and exclusion more than the setting
(preschool or school) or the presence of DS. These relationships were shaped by all
levels of the centre or school’s educational culture and beliefs, which permeated

technology; they are what Prensky (2001a) calls Digital Natives. Proponents of this view (Oblinger &
Oblinger, 2005) argue that this prolonged exposure to technology influences student values in terms of
their study experiences. This longitudinal study investigates student experiences of traditional lecture
based delivery modes and compares it to digital delivery modes utilising computer games. Over the
course of a three year period the mode of delivery was transformed from wholly traditional in the first
year to fully digital in the third year while the content and assessment were kept constant. Student
experiences were rated using an Experience Sampling Method (Hektner, Schmidt & Csikszentmihalyi,
2007) designed to capture real time experience and measure feelings of flow (a term coined by
Csikszentmihalyi to indicate optimal experience). Results indicate that students who experienced the
digital mode were happier and more involved. Also, they experienced higher concentration levels and
perceived sessions as more challenging. However, they found learning less sociable and more
confusing. Flow characteristics revealed boredom for students in the traditional setting but anxiety and
flow in the digital setting. These results suggest that by aligning teaching mode with the digital culture,
student learning experiences can be improved. However, there are some negative aspects that need to
be addressed and investigated further.",,,"Grimley, M. Green, R. and Nilsen, T. (2008) Students' Learning Experiences in the Digital Age.

adverse events during childhood can have lifelong consequences (Felitti et al. 1998). The
more adverse experiences reported, the higher the risk of negative health outcomes including
depression, alcoholism, obesity, cancer, heart disease, stroke, diabetes, suicide and early death
(Felliti, 2009).
Adverse experiences may also produce trauma: “Trauma results from an event, series of
events, or set of circumstances that is experienced by an individual as physically or
emotionally harmful or threatening and that has lasting adverse effects on the individual’s
functioning and physical, social, emotional, or spiritual well-being” (Trauma-Informed Care
in Behavioral Health Services, 2014). Events are considered traumatic if they are associated
with a high risk of causing mental disorders, such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).
Risk factors for the onset of PTSD in children who have experienced traumatic events
consistently include female gender, minority ethnicity and low socioeconomic status (SES),
parent mental health problems, pre-existing mental health problems as well as the type,
intensity, duration and the number of traumatic events (Alisic et al., 2014; Contractor, Layne,
Steinberg, Ostrowski, Ford & Elhai, 2013; Shaw, Espinel & Schultz, 2012). PTSD in children, and PTSD resulting from in-utero exposure to traumatic stress are
associated with subsequent developmental delays, poorer physical health, comorbid mental
health problems, suicide ideation and substance abuse, as well as increased school absences,
poor learning, memory and achievement, and impaired relationships with parents, siblings,
peers and teachers (Breslau, 2009; Chu & Lieberman, 2010; Delamater & Applegate, 1995;
Fairbank & Fairbank, 2009; Laplante, Brunet, Schmitz, Ciampi, & King, 2008; Scheeringa,

They announced to a startled country that the raids were authorised by warrants issued under the Firearms Act and the Terrorism Suppression Act, and they had broken a network of terrorist training camps centred in the remote Urewera mountains in the centre of the North Island. The seventeen people arrested were not, however, members of an Al-Quaeda sleeper cell. They were all local political activists. Some had high public profiles. Many were Maori nationalists.
The raids drew widespread public condemnation. They were decried as racist political harassment and evidence of the dangers inherent in the anti-terrorism legislation introduced at the behest of the US in the wake of the September 11 attacks.
The high-level Officials Committee for Domestic and External Security had been briefed before the raids. However, in order to charge people under the Terrorism Suppression Act, the Police still required the approval of the Solicitor-General. When they sought that approval for the October 2007 raids, he said that on the basis of the evidence that had been gathered he could not assert to the charges, and he went on to describe the existing law as ‘unworkable’.
The Government responded by giving the New Zealand Law Commission the task of examining whether existing law needed to be amended ‘to cover the conduct of individuals that creates risk to, or public concern about, the preservation of public safety and security and the means of obtaining evidence in relation to that conduct’. It also specified that the Commission must take account of the ‘the need to ensure an appropriate balance between the preservation of public safety and security and the maintenance of individual rights and freedoms’
This paper examines some dimensions of how this balance might be achieved. In doing so, it considers the nature and degree of a terrorist threat to New Zealand and situates this within a discussion of wider issues of negotiating risk in contemporary globalised world. It looks at the problems inherent in legislating against terrorism and the associated difficulties of enforcing that legislation.

throughout the French Pacific territory of New Caledonia. The EPK represented a rejection
of French education in favour of an alternative where everything from the language of instruction through to timetabling was designed to meet the aspirations of the indigenous Kanak people. Today, the national structure of the EPK no longer exists, although its
vision is still widely shared and the remaining school in Gossannah in the north of the island of Ouvea is thriving.
This paper examines the rise and fall of the EPK. It discusses the origins of the ideas behind the EPK, the political context which led to these being put into practice and the achievements of the EPK. It then analyses the many types of opposition the EPK
encountered. The clearest was that which came from the French Government and other procolonial
forces. However, the EPK was also under siege from within the independence movement where, for different reasons, it found opponents in both radical and conservative groupings.
This paper argues that the EPK's close association with a formal political structure was both its strength and its weakness. It argues that the EPK was a casualty of the division and demobilisation of the Kanak independence movement that France was able to achieve through the 1988 Matignon Accords.",,,"Small, D.

"5123","10092/459",,,"Small, D.",,,,,,,,"2009",,,"Constructed to popular acclaim upon the social ruins left by the Great Depression, social democracy was flying high through the economic boom decades of the 1950s and 60s until it was diagnosed to be terminally ill in the 1970s. It had been under attack for some time for its failure to deliver on its promise to manage capitalism in a fair way. What really signaled the end, however, was its failure to deal with the economic crisis brought on by the oil shock.
Out of the ensuing chaos came clarity. A new programme emerged; one that had an analysis unfamiliar to most, which set out the flaws of social democracy and the Keynesian economic model on which it was based, and proposed a clear set of alternatives. Neoliberalism, its advocates argued, was not simply an alternative to social democracy, it was the only alternative. Announcing itself with the election of Ronald Reagan in the US in 1979 and Margaret Thatcher in the UK the following year1
Three decades after it burst onto the world stage, neoliberalism recently appeared vulnerable for the first time. Just as none of the pulleys and levers of Keynesian economic management could deal with the scourge of stagflation in the seventies, the magic of the markets promised by neoliberalism appeared to be both responsible for and incapable of dealing with the global financial meltdown that was triggered by the collapse of the American sub-prime mortgage market in 2007. , the neoliberal project had transformed almost every human society on earth by the turn of the century.
Neoliberalism’s usurpation of social democracy was thorough. It involved radical reform of almost every aspect of society, with education being particularly important. The social democratic model of education had no place in the brave new world of neoliberalism.
This paper examines the rise of neoliberalism and its influence over educational theory and policy. In particular, it considers neoliberalism’s attack one of the central aspects of the social democratic model, egalitarianism. It also considers the extent to which the current financial crisis provides an opportunity to move beyond neoliberalism.",,,"Small, D. (2009) Neoliberalism's Fate: Implications for Education.

We will show how the processes of collaboration and sharing which characterised all aspects of the project impacted on those involved and suggest that this is a way of working together that, if used more widely, would lead to capacity-building to promote inclusion.
The project focussed on teachers working with students described as working long term at level 1 (of 8 levels) in the New Zealand Curriculum (NZC) (Ministry of Education, 2007). Earlier research had shown that teachers in regular classrooms in NZ were often puzzled about how to include some students with special education needs in their planning, teaching and assessment. Many teachers saw the NZC as irrelevant for some students with special education needs. The development of the Exemplars provides a very practical example of a framework that supports educators and families to work collaboratively; as well as the positive outcomes that are possible when working in this way.
The project team included classroom and visiting support teachers (from primary and secondary schools, regular classrooms and special schools), curriculum advisors, assessment facilitators, and teacher educators. We pay particular attention to new
understandings about curriculum, pedagogy and assessment that emerged as together we learned to use narrative assessment.
Assessment tools can both enable and constrain what can be noticed and reported. Assessment methods as well as the results of assessment can lead to painting different kinds of pictures about students and teachers. Participating in the professional learning aspects of this project provided teachers with a language and a framework (Carr, 2006) to consider what learning might look in their classrooms. It became apparent that often progress is evident with the benefit of hindsight. This recognition challenges the belief that assessment should be predictive and predictable. Narrative assessment reminds us of the complexity of life and of learning; it also provides us with the means of better describing some of this complexity.
We learned that when we write a narrative assessment, we do so with a particular way of understanding a student, a particular way of seeing and interpreting a student. When we share the narrative with other people, including the student, we are sharing our way of interpreting the student, sharing our sense of who the student is. As we engage in conversation about the narrative, all participants in the conversation are together constructing, and re-constructing the student’s identity as a learner. In our conversations about narrative assessment, we can be excited, affirmed or even challenged in our sense of who a student is.
We also learned that our writing is influenced by how we understand ourselves, how we see and interpret ourselves and our actions. The way we construct our own identity shapes, and is shaped by, the identities we construct for our students, as well as the other people in our classroom and school communities. If we cannot see our students’ learning, how might we see our teaching; how might we see ourselves as teachers?",,,"Morton, M., McMenamin, T.

such a limited visual palette into sound. In this paper I will explore how an environment of sensory deprivation
can influence and shape one’s work and how a creative artist can find a productive solution to the issue of
transcribing such diverse elements as landscape, history, colour (or absence thereof) and natural phenomena
(such as wind) into a satisfying musical and poetic form. I conclude that through the study of this distant, frozen,
inhospitable land, my creativity has paradoxically moved into a very fertile stage. It was not, as I first thought, the

Traditional Maori healers find themselves at the centre of such impacts and experience a unique set of tensions in working to sustain a healing tradition dependent on maintaining the integrity of both the environment and matauranga Maori (Maori knowledge). In addition to balancing their existing relationships between the environment and traditional knowledge, they must also forge new relationships and practices in the development of health services.

The practice of traditional healing is founded on the notion of service to the community where practitioners respond to a ‘calling’ and commonly have a gift for the work. The practices of traditional healers evolve from serving the people and notions of koha (gift, donation) and reciprocity permeate this relationship. However within the health system concepts of practice and service are substantially different. Services are delivered to clients and rely on consistent application of skills by professionals organized around particular specialties. This alters the nature of the therapeutic relationship and the expectations of both the healer and the community. Transitioning from a ‘practice’ based approach to one of ‘service’ delivery requires careful negotiation of challenges in terms of changing relationships, expectations of quality, and maintenance of capacity. 

Research and evaluation have a distinct role to play in developing a pathway to the future in both the retention and development of indigenous health knowledge that informs traditional healing, and in producing the type of evidence necessary to support the development of rongoa (medicine, cure) services within mainstream health systems.",,,"Ahuriri-Driscoll, A., Hudson, M., Baker, V., Hepi, M., Mika, C., Tiakiwai, S.J.

"5528","10092/459",,,"Morton, M.||Gordon, L.",,,,,,,,"2006",,,"There is a strong view in the international literature that an effective initial
teacher education (ITE) is a necessary condition for high quality inclusive
education. Some believe that far too little attention has been paid to preparing
teachers for the inclusive school. Booth et al (2003) argue that there are some
basic questions that need to be asked in developing teacher education courses
that support inclusion:
• To what extent does the curriculum of teacher education encourage the
development of inclusive schools?
• What preparation and support do teachers need to implement inclusion?
• What are the policy and cultural contexts for the development of
inclusion?
• How are barriers to learning and participation overcome in teacher
education? (Booth, Nes, & Stromstad, 2003).
The current study provides a multi-faceted approach to answering these (and
other) questions in the New Zealand context. The starting point of our work is
the phenomenon of the production of exclusionary practices within inclusive
programmes. In the US and some other countries, the separation of ‘general’
from ‘special’ teacher education formalises a two system approach (Blanton,
Griffin, Winn, & Pugach, 1997b). In New Zealand, an inclusionary legislative
framework, a generalist system of teacher education, and a school framework
that specifically demands ‘diversity’ should generate the conditions for inclusion. That it does not uniformly do so is due to a range of factors, including the historical legacy of the homogenous and exclusionary classroom and the normative teacher education programmes that this model implies.
There are also policy issues, especially the framework of school ‘choice’ that
privileges the ‘academic’ classroom, not the ‘democratic’ one, which makes
inclusion difficult to achieve. In essence, then, New Zealand’s schooling system
demands inclusionary practices, but there are numerous barriers to achieving
them.",,,"Morton, M., Gordon, L. (2006) In the Public Good? Preparing Teachers to Be Inclusive Educators: A New Zealand Research Project.

settings, have provided evidence that early childhood services are the ‘natural
places’ for providing links between families within their community.
The role that teachers and services can play in building communities is a
change from traditional child-­-centred philosophies, but fits with most teachers
understanding and awareness of the need for partnerships with parents and
their role as a professional in the community. Building, supporting and growing
communities is often the subject of debate amongst social services and educational agencies, but is less often heard in the ‘market place’ or political
sectors.
Where a community does come to the attention of media and political spotlights is when the ‘community’ is needed to support a function that any
particular service or government no longer wishes to have responsibility
for. Communities themselves are required to care for those within them,
but New Zealand research from childhood geography have demonstrated the
changing understanding of ‘community’ for children and their families, and the
different experiences of childhood that children in the 21st century have from
those who grew up in the 19th or 20th centuries. Undeniably, strong communities and networks support strong families; strong families with less
health, social, mental and emotional issues, i.e more resilient. This presentation
explores how early childhood teachers, services and training providers can
be rethinking early childhood pedagogy, professionalism and practices to
assist parents, families and communities in the years ahead. As both New
Zealand and Japan have experienced devastating natural disasters in the
early months of 2011 the importance of building and maintaining communities

The intervening fifty years has seen the development of a third most populated ‘nation’ – Facebook users. Significant changes in technology that took a decade to infiltrate the wider world can now take effect within a year. Foreseeing what the next decade might bring is now equally staggering and this conundrum has profound effects on national education systems empowered to prepare its citizens for survival and societal participation. Researching the future is a particularly high-risk enterprise, especially for the education sector (Bolstad, 2012). The New Zealand Curriculum 2007 took on such an approach although its intended direction has yet to be fully realised. The New Zealand school sector’s key qualification strategy, the National Certificate in Educational Achievement, (NCEA) still largely remains a measure of lower-level recognition of prior learning and ability to access information. It seems to be more of a ‘sorting’ tool (Bolstad & Gilbert, 2008) and preparation for tertiary education than an acknowledgement of students’ aptitude, dispositions and capability to meet the demands of an ever-changing environment.  This paper will look at the nature of twenty-first century learning and the needs for a change in assessment policy particularly in the senior secondary school.",,,"Snape, P.M.

I limit my focus to the Tao Te Ching (attributed to Lao Tzu), paying brief attention to the origins of this classic work of Chinese philosophy before concentrating on several themes of relevance to Freire’s work. An essay by James Fraser (1997), who makes three references to the Tao Te Ching in his discussion of love and history in Freire’s pedagogy, provides a helpful starting point for investigation. A summary of Fraser’s account is followed by a more detailed discussion of the meaning of ‘action’ and ‘non-action’, the nature and role of knowing and knowledge, and the relationship between ignorance, happiness and education for Freire and Lao Tzu. I conclude that while the differences between these two systems of thought are significant and must be acknowledged, reflection upon these differences has the potential to be educationally productive.",,,"Roberts, P.

"8465","10092/459",,,"Snape, P.M.",,,,,,,,"2012",,,"Senior secondary schooling in New Zealand has a particularly traditional and complex nature. While the breadth of specialist subjects offered by schools has increased tremendously, seldom have those in control questioned whether the purpose of this learning meets current needs.  Bolstad and Gilbert (2008) believe senior school education is geared toward screening, sorting and disciplining students for university study and the content-driven and assessment oriented approach to teaching and learning is of an Industrial Age that will not best serve and prepare students for twenty-first century living. 
This paper outlines a proposed doctoral thesis study of an innovative approach being undertaken in a secondary school class to address these problems and improve the quality of learning for students. The class includes approximately 30 Year 11-13 students from a variety of Technology based specialisms. The approach aims to meet Claxton’s (2007) idea that we need to explain to students:
ߪthat school isn’t really about the Tudors and the Periodic Table. It is about becoming a brave and skilled explorer, a cunning detective; an imaginative creator; a tough competitor – in whatever field of life they want to work and play in. We have to talk to them seriously about what they are up to; what they can expect to gain; and what they will have to put in. (p. 131)
The innovation will follow Bolstad and Gilbert’s (2008) recommendation that a competency-oriented model should predominate over the traditional content and assessment driven form and that personalised programmes build students’ learning capacity (Claxton, 2007) and dispositions. It will feature integrated learning of key competencies and values incorporating collaborative and inquiry-based activity in Technology Education and related specialist classes. Explicit teaching of higher-order thinking skills and student engagement through the conative domain (Riggs and Gholar, 2009) will be key features in promoting twenty-first century learning. 
The study will use a design-based implementation research method (Hoadley, 2002; Penuel, Fishman, Cheng and Sabelli, 2011; and The Design-Based Research Collective, 2003). This qualitative method has been chosen as it can effectively evaluate the development of innovations that foster alignment and coordination of supports for improving teaching and learning (Penuel et. al. 2011). The innovation focuses on a problem of practice, is a collaborative design, develops theory related to classroom learning and demonstrates a capacity for sustained change in senior secondary education.",,,"Snape, P.M.

This is particularly critical for initial teacher education. This paper is seeking comment and/or support for three recommendations:
The services of the UfB Crown Entity be adjusted to cover all those who work in the schooling sector. This could be done by Ministry of Education through the joint Memorandum of Understanding so that existing funding is linked to access to the services of the Network for Learning is enabled for student teachers and tertiary staff working with initial teacher education. (Note: This would not include any subsidy for bandwidth services because they are only relevant for school premises).
A national hui be urgently convened to better understand and start to disseminate the contributions and needs of initial teacher education, including services such as nationwide ePortfolio services that are already deployed for schools and professional learning development (PLD) in the schooling sector.
The government’s billion dollar investment in UFB be leveraged by gathering relevant illustrations of best practices plus related research and development to inform the national strategy and all relevant educational agencies and institutions.

noted
“To
ensure
that
the
teaching
profession
can
attract
and
retain
high
quality
individuals,
broad
changes
are
needed
in
the
way
that
the
profession
is
perceived.
Teachers
cannot
afford
to
be
isolated
practitioners
working
within
a
single
classroom.
If
teaching
is
to
be
seen
as
a
high
status
profession
much
greater
emphasis
is
needed
on
continued
learning
by
teachers
within
schools
supported
by
clear
and
strong
professional
leadership
and
the
sharing
of
effective
practice
across
schools”
(p.

By
2013,
the
Ministry
of
Education
was
calling
for
initial

providers
to
ensure
that
new
graduates
were
able
to
show
“adaptive
expertise”:

"10731","10092/459",,,"Roberts, R.",,,,,,,,"2008",,,"Of all the great novelists of the twentieth century, the German writer Hermann Hesse is arguably one of the most important for educationists. Education is a key theme in a number of Hesse’s novels and short stories. Beneath the Wheel (Hesse, 1968a) and Demian (Hesse, 1999) focus on school experiences, while Narcissus and Goldmund (Hesse, 1968b) is in part concerned with learning and teaching in a cloister school during the Middle Ages. More broadly, Hesse’s published work is united by a lifelong concern with processes of inner growth. Hesse is one of the finest exponents of the German tradition of the Bildungsroman: the novel of education as formation or development (Swales, 1978; Peters, 1996). Siddhartha (Hesse, 2000a), with its systematic account of the spiritual journey of its central character, provides a good example of Hesse’s contribution to this genre, as does the early novel Peter Camenzind (Hesse, 1969). Perhaps the most significant educational work in Hesse’s
corpus, however, is his last and longest novel, The Glass Bead Game (Hesse, 2000b).
First published (as Das Glasperlenspiel) in 1943, The Glass Bead Game marked the end of a long and difficult process of composition. Hesse worked on the book for more than a decade (Field, 1968; Mileck, 1970). Three years after the initial publication of the book Hesse was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature. The first English translation of the novel was released under the title Magister Ludi in 1949. The second and more widely cited English version, translated by Richard and Clara Winston, was published in 1969. The main part of the novel focuses on the life of Joseph Knecht, who grows up in Castalia, a ‘pedagogical province’ of the 23rd century. The highest cultural achievement of Castalia is the Glass Bead Game. The Game remains somewhat mysterious, but readers learn that it blends aesthetic, intellectual and meditative elements, and allows participants to play with the total contents of culture. It is a means for linking all disciplines; a kind of universal language. Knecht rises through the elite schooling system, becomes a member of the Order of the Glass Bead Game, and is eventually appointed to the exalted position of Magister Ludi (Master of the Game). Along the way, however, he questions aspects of Castalian life, his doubts ultimately leading to his unprecedented decision to resign his post as Magister Ludi in favour of a quiet life as a private tutor. The main story of Knecht’s life is preceded by the narrator’s brief history of the Game and followed by a set of poems and three fictional autobiographies or ‘Lives’ (presented as posthumous writings from Joseph’s student days).This paper considers The Glass Bead Game from an educational point of view. I argue that in the life of Joseph Knecht a profound process of educational
transformation becomes evident. Knecht himself conceives of this as a form of ‘awakening’. The paper analyses Knecht’s transformation in the light of Paulo Freire’s theory of education. Knecht develops a critical consciousness, becoming, over time, less certain of his certainties, more aware of his own incompleteness, and increasingly convinced of the importance of teaching. Dialogue plays a key role in the development of Knecht’s critique of Castalia and his understanding of himself and his vocation as a human being. The paper falls into four main parts. The first section details key moments and figures in Knecht’s educational life. This is followed by a closer analysis of the dialogical bond that develops between Knecht and two other characters, Plinio Designori and Father Jacobus. The third section discusses the relationship between conscientisation and contemplation for Knecht and others in Castalia. The final part reflects on the significance of death as a theme in the novel and considers some of the educational implications arising from this.",,,"Roberts, R.

This research focuses on 34 young adolescent students' perceptions about learning to read and nine parents’ perceptions and experiences in supporting reading. The 11-to-13 year-old students came from six schools where overall there was a higher representation of students from diverse cultural backgrounds. The research found that even though the parents had a range of formal educational qualifications or lack of them, they all wanted their children to be successful readers. Their interest, personal experiences and perceived ability in reading were seen to be influential in encouraging children to read.

several possibilities: variable findings may be due to limitations of molecular analyses; ‘hit

quantitative PCR. A serum sample from each woman was tested for CMV and EBV IgG. To
place our results in context, we reviewed the existing literature and performed a meta-analysis
of our results together with previous PCR studies of EBV, CMV, and breast cancer. Of
the serology samples, 67 of 70 (96%) were EBV IgG positive and 49 of 70 (70%) were CMV
IgG positive. QPCR detected EBV in 24 (34%) of the tumour and 9 (13%) of the paired normal
specimens and CMV in 0 (0%) of the tumour and 2 (3%) of the paired normal specimens.
Our findings, together with earlier results summarised in the meta-analysis, suggest
several possibilities: variable findings may be due to limitations of molecular analyses; ‘hit
and run’ oncogenesis may lead to inconsistent results; one or both viruses has a role at a
later stage in breast cancer development; infection with multiple viruses increases breast
cancer risk; or neither virus has a role. Future studies should focus on ways to investigate
these possibilities, and should include comparisons of breast cancer tissue samples with
appropriate normal tissue samples.",,,"Hayes, J.M., Kirk, R., Richardson, A. (2015) Shock Wave Lithotripsy (ESWL) results aren’t improving.

The objective was to utilise a Community Based Participatory Research (CBPR) approach to create a culturally relevant documentary resource for Māori at risk for Type 2 diabetes. 
Type 2 diabetes is almost three times more common in the indigenous people of New Zealand (Māori) than non-Māori. Māori are diagnosed younger and are two to three times more likely to develop complications such as eye disease, kidney failure, strokes and heart disease. Mortality rates for Māori with type 2 diabetes are seven times higher than for non-Māori. Prevention, detection and management of diabetes have become a health priority. This is a significant challenge given the low level of diabetes knowledge and awareness in the Māori community. Further, despite the high rate of Type 2 diabetes, little is known about their personal understanding or experience of the disease. 
Several studies of Māori health identify a need for new health communication approaches to diabetes prevention in order to reduce the wide gap between Māori and non-Māori disease rates. There is both an absence of theoretically grounded audio visual materials focusing on Māori health and a lack of academic studies on diabetes prevention and mediated health communication. This is particularly true of studies utilising and evaluating documentary narratives. 
A CBPR approach to the documentary was appropriate because intervention strategies designed following its principles will reflect the cultural values and behavioural preferences of the participating community. A CBPR approach provides a strong model for enacting local action oriented approaches in the creation of a diabetes documentary that reflects Māori cultural beliefs, practices, and a narrative tradition. 
Documentary video can be an effective health communication tool because it allows for innovative ways to document and represent people and issues while accommodating power differences between researchers and the community. It can give voice to participants who are not typically engaged in research. Utilizing documentary is a way for communities to prioritize their own health issues and for participants to share their own health narratives. 
Working directly with the affected communities can help privilege traditional knowledge. Narrative is particularly important in indigenous populations where it is customary to receive information by listening and watching rather than reading. And documentary is well suited for encouraging behaviour change because it can be employed to demonstrate social modelling or observational learning as outlined in Social Cognitive Theory.",,,"Farmer, A., Gage, J., Kirk, R., Edgar, T.

Deaf and hard of hearing (DHH) students are entering higher education in much larger numbers than ever before. Yet, many of these students discover they are ill-prepared for this environment and this impacts on their ability to access the curriculum in the higher education context.
Purpose
The purpose of this presentation is to report on the academic readiness and transition experiences of deaf and hard-of-hearing (DHH) students attending higher education institutions with small populations of DHH students. 
Method
A sequential mixed methods procedure was used; an initial nested quantitative and qualitative written survey was followed by an in-depth qualitative interview with a selected sample of participants.  Sixty-four students completed the written survey and eight were interviewed in-depth. 
Results
Findings related to transition indicated that strong self-advocacy skills, an understanding of their own learning styles, and being familiar with the range of resources available, including new technology were critically influential to their learning and participation experiences.  Being able to self-identify support needs confidently and knowledgably was a valuable skill, and often one that students had not been required to implement at secondary school. 
Conclusion
An increased awareness within compulsory education of DHH students’ academic and social needs prior to transitioning to higher education must be at the forefront of any move towards inclusive education at the postsecondary level, where both deaf and hearing students are equal participants.",,,"Powell, D.R.

As part of a broader epidemiological study we interviewed 10 head teachers to understand the status of, and challenges to, inclusion of oral health education in the curricula of public and private schools in Tamil Nadu, India. Objectives: There were two main objectives to the study: (i) to describe the views of head teachers about implementation of oral health education in school curricula; and (ii) to identify challenges to achieving oral health education in public and private schools in Tamil Nadu. Method: We implemented a qualitative descriptive design with a purposive sample of ten head teachers who participated in semi-structured interviews. Thematic coding was used to analyse and report the data. Results: There is the lack of oral health education in public and private schools in Tamil Nadu, India. Four main types of barriers to the initiation and implementation of oral health education were: lack of recognition, academic burden, the prioritisation of other health needs, and policy inequities. Head teachers acknowledged the lack of oral health education in their schools, yet also acknowledged the importance of oral health education in promoting students’ health. Conclusion: Health curricula in Tamil Nadu schools lack integration of oral health education. Limited access to the services, cultural factors, policy deficiencies, insufficient awareness among policy makers, the nature of the education system, and a lack of research contribute to the current situation. Policy makers should address these barriers to enable and promote oral health education strategies in both private and public schools of Tamil Nadu.",,,"Veerasamy A, Gage J, Kirk RC (2017).

survey of unmet secondary healthcare need in New Zealand (one collecting data from GPs, and three from
community surveys). The secondary aim was to obtain an estimate of the prevalence of unmet secondary
healthcare need, to inform sample size calculations for a national survey.
METHODS: An electronic system was set up for GPs in Christchurch (Pegasus PHO) and Auckland (Auckland
PHO) to record cases of unmet need as encountered in clinics. For the community surveys, a questionnaire
developed by the authors was administered to people from the same electoral wards as the GP clinics.
Three modes of questionnaire administration were trialled: online, telephone and face-to-face interview.
Random population sampling from the Māori and General Electoral Rolls was used to identify eligible
survey participants until there were approximately 200 respondents for each method in each city. Data
collection took place from November 2015 to February 2016.
RESULTS: GP reports: Pegasus PHO: 8/78 eligible practices recorded 28 cases of unmet secondary healthcare
need in 10 weeks. Auckland PHO: 3/26 practices participated and recorded no cases in three weeks.
Surveys: 1,277 interviews were completed (online 428, telephone 447, face-to-face 402).
For primary healthcare, 211/1,277 (16.5%) had missed a GP visit because of cost (online 25.0%, telephone
11.6%, face-to-face 12.9%). For secondary healthcare, 119/1,277 (9.3%) reported unmet healthcare need
that had been identified by a health professional (online 11.2%; telephone 9.2%; face-to-face 7.5%). Of
these, 75/119 (63.0%) required a consultation, and 47/119 (39.5%) required a procedure.
Completed interview rates as a percentage of names on the Electoral Roll were low (online 8.8%, telephone
15.4%, face-to-face 13.9%), affected by changed addresses and lack of listed telephone numbers. The
response rate for those with valid phone numbers was 47.6%, and for those with valid addresses was 31.5%.
CONCLUSIONS: Using the Electoral Rolls to identify respondents is problematic. For a national survey,
random population sampling by address, similar to the method employed for the New Zealand Health
Survey, but giving respondents a choice between face-to-face and phone interviews, is proposed. Asking
GPs to record data on unmet need for secondary care was not successful. Our pilot study suggests there is
sufficient unmet secondary healthcare need in New Zealand to merit a national survey",,,"Bagshaw P, Bagshaw S, Frampton C, Gauld R, Green T, Harris C, Hornblow A, Hudson B, Raymont A, Richardson AK, Shaw C, Toop L (2017).

Schmid explores the concept of the beautiful or good life by asking what is necessary for each individual to be able to develop their own art of living and which aspects of life are significant when shaping a good and beautiful life. One aspect of Schmid’s theory is the practical application of philosophy through the notions of Bildung, (self-) refection, prudence and practical wisdom, as well as the requirement for each individual to take responsibility for actively shaping their life as an artwork. In this sense, each person is the artist responsible for living their own beautiful life.

We argue that there are some useful parallels between Schmid’s concept of the art of living and P4C, such as the ideal of a holistic philosophy that is “lived”. The pragmatic approach of P4C focuses on the embodied learner who practices critical, caring and creative thinking. Both P4C and Schmid’s theory are reminiscent of the Aristotelian notion of practical wisdom (phronesis), which allows for an approach to an education for life that prepares (young) students to develop their own art of living. We also critically discuss tensions arising between these two concepts.",,,"D'Olimpio L, Teschers C (2016). Philosophy for Children meets the Art of Living.

in New Zealand.
METHOD: Relative risks for lifestyle risk factors for colorectal cancer, and population data on the
prevalence of exposure in New Zealand, were used to estimate the population attributable fraction (PAF)

RESULTS: Six modifiable lifestyle risk factors were identified. The PAFs for these risk factors were 9% for
obesity, 7% for alcohol, 4% for physical inactivity, 3% for smoking, 5% for consumption of red meat and 3%
for processed meat. PAFs di  ered by ethnic group and sex. In women, the highest PAFs were 19% for obesity
in Pacific women, 14% for obesity in Māori women, 7% for physical inactivity in Asian women, and 8% for
obesity in European/other women. In men, the highest PAFs were 17% for obesity in Pacific men, 14% for
high alcohol consumption in Māori men, 5% for physical inactivity in Asian men and 9% for high alcohol

One of the reasons is that domestic students tend to be practising teachers studying part-time and are located throughout the country.  Another reason, and one that is significant for this discussion, is that increasing numbers of early to mid-career teachers, teacher educators and university lecturers from developing countries are seeking postgraduate qualifications from established western  universities and those universities see them as a necessary source of revenue in an academic market where financial contribution margins are as important as scholarly achievement.  An earlier publication by some of the current authors (Greenwood, Alam, & Kabir 2013) reported a case study of a Bangladeshi teacher development project in which the government of Bangladesh sent fourteen experienced teacher educators to a New Zealand university to complete a two-year research-based Masters of Education programme. It critically analysed the local and international context of the project, ways in which the study programme was successful and the areas in which it fell short.  It constructed its analysis in terms of a concept of fair trade, and proposed that for an academic trade to be fair it needs to meet the needs of both parties. Specifically this entailed meeting the academic expectations of the host university and conducting research field work that addressed the needs of educational development in the home country in terms that were compatible with its material and cultural context. Our discussion in the earlier publication acknowledged that there was no single lens through which the home country would evaluate success. It argued that analysis of processes of development called for recognition of multiple perspectives which appreciate the complexity of the ways  global monetarist influences and western epistemologies might be regarded, and might be useful, in shaping the  direction of educational development.   It further argued that the evolution of a fair exchange would involve the development of a partnership that would construct both partners as learners as well as agents of change. It suggested that for such a partnership to develop the relationship needed to be on-going and evolve over time.
Here we report aspects of a second stage of the project. We examine the emergence of what we now more confidently call an academic partnership. We examine how that partnership developed beyond the period of the first Bangladeshi teacher development contract and the ways it is extending the original project’s research and wider learning agendas. We previously reported key challenges for creating a fair academic partnership: developing a student learning community, grounding research in local conditions, investigating the potential for and the process of change, seeking relevant epistemological frameworks, and achieving practical outcomes. In these terms we here   discuss five initiatives: the development of a doctoral learning community, the publication of emergent research, and three new doctoral research projects. We, the authors, are directly involved in the project, the first author as an academic of the host university, the other three authors as doctoral students from Bangladesh who were involved in the initial Masters study contract. Our locatedness within the research is discussed in our explanation of our methodology below. 
We construct our examination in terms of participatory action research grounded in the following four questions.   How can doctoral research be shaped to meet the needs of international students’ home contexts as well as contributing to international knowledge? How can the collective potential of the student group be tapped? What research and pedagogical methodologies are useful for exploring and supporting educational change? What value systems and approaches to knowledge underpin the work?",,,"Greenwood, J. , Alam, S., Salahuddin, A.N.M., Rasheed, M.M.H-A.

The implementation of a new learning management system at the university provided a context for course instructors to explore the potential of web2.0 tools to facilitate collaborative learning. This research sought to understand teacher education students’ experiences of working collaboratively using a wiki as the participatory technological web2.0 tool. The research study involved pre-service education teachers enrolled as either on-campus or distance (flexible) students in a compulsory first year curriculum paper. A quantitative and qualitative methodology was used to determine learner perspectives on working within a collaborative learning space. Working collaboratively using a wiki as a participatory technological tool was new to most pre-service teachers.

"13368","10092/458",,,"Gowan, M. E.||Sloan, J. A.||Kirk, R. C.",,,,,,,,"2015",,,"Background: Conventional disaster preparedness messaging focuses largely on promoting survival actions and
communications planning for the immediate post-disaster period. While such preparedness is vital, we have
long-observed a gap in preventive medicine and disaster planning for building personal resilience – preventatively – to
persevere through prolonged recovery timeframes. There are many helpful attitudes and behaviors that people can
develop to increase their readiness and capacity for drastic life changes, encompassing not only health-protective
preparedness actions but health-promoting attitudes for “minding the risk” and “practicing resilience” as well.
For instance, quality of life assessments and well-being interventions are widely-known for the clinically
significant improvements they can produce in patient-reported outcomes. Similarly, health promotion
interventions are implemented preventatively when a risk is identified yet a disease is not present, and can provide
health benefits throughout people’s lives, regardless of the type of adversities they eventually encounter (medical,
environmental, or other).
Discussion: We argue there is an overlooked opportunity to leverage well-being theories and methods from clinical
settings and public health practice for the purpose of preventatively boosting disaster readiness and bolstering
capacity for long-term resilience. We also highlight our previously-published research indicating a role for integrating
personal meaning into preparedness messages. This is an opportune time for applying well-being concepts and
practices as tools for developing disaster readiness, as risk awareness grows through real-time tracking of hazardous
events via social media. For example, two sudden-onset disasters occurred within ten days of each other in 2014 and
caught worldwide attention for their extreme hazards, despite dramatic differences in scale. The 22 March 2014
landslide tragedy in Washington State, USA, and the 1 April 2014 Chilean earthquake and Pacific-wide tsunami
alerts brought home how persistently vulnerable we all are, and how developing intrinsic personal readiness for
scientifically-known risks before disaster unfolds is essential policy.
Summary: Gap programming that addresses personal readiness challenges in prevention timeframes could save lives
and costs. We contend that bridging this readiness gap will prevent situations where people, communities, and systems
survive the initial impact, but their resilience trajectories are vulnerable to the challenges of long-haul recovery.",,,"Gowan, M. E., Sloan, J. A., Kirk, R. C. (2015) Prepared for what?

Dry mouth is a common and troublesome symptom in palliative care. Pilocarpine is a cholinergic agent that promotes salivation.  We aimed to test the effectiveness of pilocarpine drops compared to placebo, for participants with advanced cancer, who experienced dry mouth. 

Method : 
Aggregated n-of-1 trials for patients of specialist palliative care services with advanced cancer assessed as having a dry mouth. Each participant was offered three cycles of pilocarpine drops 4%, 6 mg tds (3 days) and placebo drops (3 days) in random order. Patients self-completed a diary using validated symptom and quality of life scores. The randomisation order was unmasked at the end of each person’s trial by a clinician independent of the trial to allow a treatment decision for individual patients to be made.

Results :
Twenty people were recruited to this pilot study, of whom five completed the planned three cycles; 36 cycles of data were completed in total.  438 doses of pilocarpine were administered.  Most withdrawals related to deteriorating condition, unacceptable toxicity, non-compliance with study procedures or withdrawal of consent. Overall, no clinical difference in relief of dry mouth was noted on two measures of dry mouth, and an oral health related quality of life scale.

Conclusion : 
The formulation of pilocarpine drops proved unacceptable to most participants.  More work is required to determine an appropriate dose and method of delivery, then a retest of pilocarpine drops for this symptom.",,,"Nikles, J., Mitchell, G.K., Hardy, J., Agar, M., Senior, H., Carmont, S.A., Schluter, P.J., Good, P., Vora, R., Currow, D.

However, the contemporary nature of fathering and families is changing, especially for emigrant minority populations. Approximately 7% of people in New Zealand are of Pacific descent. While recognised, the importance and impact of the role of fathers has received little empirical attention among this population. This paper examines the relationship between father involvement and their child’s behaviour outcomes amongst a birth cohort of Pacific children and fathers in New Zealand.
Methods: A birth cohort was established in 2000 from births at Middlemore Hospital in South Auckland where at least one parent was identified as being of Pacific ethnicity and a New Zealand permanent resident. This included 1376 mothers, 825 fathers, and 1398 children at baseline. At the 6-years measurement wave, father involvement was measured using the Inventory of Father Involvement (IFI), and child behaviour measured using the Child Behaviour Check-list (CBCL). Internalising and externalising behaviour was related to father involvement in crude and adjusted logistic regression and generalised estimating equation models.
Results: 571 Pacific fathers participated at the 6-years measurement wave; most of Samoan (42.9%) or Tongan (33.5%) ethnic identification. Overall, 190 (32.1%) children exhibited clinical or board-line internalising and externalising behaviour. Self-reported father involvement was generally high, but lower involvement was significantly related to increased odds of internalising (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] approximately 1.9, p<0.001) and externalising (aOR approximately 4.0, p<0.001) behaviour. 
Conclusion: Father involvement was significantly associated with child behaviour in Pacific families within New Zealand. Strategies that promote and enable increased father involvement may reduce negative child outcomes; common to a disproportion of Pacific families.",,,"Tautolo, E-S., Schluter, P.J., Paterson, J.

While having significant healthcare implications, basic robust epidemiological information about wheelchair users is often lacking due, in part, to this population’s ‘hidden’ nature. Increasingly popular in epidemiological research, Respondent Driven Sampling (RDS) provides a mechanism for generating unbiased population-based estimates for hard-to-reach populations, overcoming biases inherent within other sampling methods. This paper reports the first published study to employ RDS amongst wheelchair users.

Methods: Between October 2015 and January 2016, a short, successfully piloted, internet-based national survey was initiated. Twenty seeds from diverse organisations were invited to complete the survey then circulate it to peers within their networks following a well-defined protocol. A predetermined reminder protocol was triggered when seeds or their peers failed to respond. All participants were entered into a draw for an iPad.

Results: Overall, 19 people participated (9 women); 12 initial seeds, followed by seven second-wave participants arising from four seeds. Completion time for the survey ranged between 7 and 36 minutes. Despite repeated reminders, no further people were recruited.

Discussion: While New Zealand wheelchair user numbers are unknown, an estimated 14% of people have physical impairments that limited mobility. The 19 respondents generated from adopting the RDS methodology here thus represents a negligible fraction of wheelchair users in New Zealand, and an insufficient number to ensure equilibrium required for unbiased analyses. While successful in other hard-to-reach populations, applying RDS methodology to wheelchairs users requires further consideration. Formative research exploring areas of network characteristics, acceptability of RDS, appropriate incentive options, and seed selection amongst wheelchair users is needed..",,,"Bourke, J.A., Schluter, P.J., Hay-Smith, E.J.C., Snell, D.L.

doing things and also refine existing techniques to 
improve sporting performance. Coaches are currently 
experimenting using ischaemic preconditioning (IPC) 
over consecutive days in the hope of improving 
competitive performances. 


Aims First, to quantify the physiological impact of 
1 week of IPC on simulated Keirin cycling performance. 
Second, to investigate if biochemical stress markers 
are affected over the treatment period. 


Methods Using a randomised, sham-controlled 
design, 18 active adults undertook seven consecutive 
days of IPC treatment (45 min occlusion/reperfusion) 
applied to each leg at either 220 mm Hg (treatment, 
n=9) or 20 mm Hg (sham, n=9). Urinary measures of 
inflammation, oxidative stress and indirect nitric oxide 
synthesis were undertaken daily. A simulated Keirin 
cycling competition (430 s Wingate tests) was 
performed on day 10, with baseline and 
postintervention cycling VO2max (days 1, 11 and 18) 
and 30 s Wingate tests (day 2) undertaken for 
comparison.


Results The treatment group had enhanced mean 
cycling power (3.4%), while neopterin and biopterin in 
conjunction with total neopterin were significantly 
lower (p<0.05) and total biopterin significantly greater 
(p<0.05) during the simulated Keirin. Aerobic fitness 
measures significantly improved from baseline to 
postintervention (VO2peak: 12.8% "", maximal aerobic 
power: 18.5% "").


Conclusions Seven consecutive days of IPC 
improved aerobic and anaerobic capacity measures, 
with modulations in oxidative stress, immune system 
activation and nitric oxide/catecholamine synthesis.",,,"Lindsay A, Petersen C, Blackwell G, Ferguson H, Parker G, Steyn N, Gieseg SP (2017).

Data triangulation enhanced the reporting of the 'public' and 'private' facets of the coaches' instructional processes.Findings: Common tendencies revealed coaching routines (i.e. number and moment of interventions, modes of communications, evaluative feedback, instructions, content and intentions) and some differences that are context and/or personal profile dependant. Moreover, the triangulation process provided us access to the coaches' personal logic and their ability to adapt to particular in-match events.Conclusions: A conceptual framework aiming to study the coaches' activity in their naturalistic context (i.e. general context and local context) is proposed, as well as a methodology for a holistic approach of in-match coaching.

Despite the development of a wide body of literature suggesting the efficacy of game-based approaches (GBAs) to teaching and learning, GBAs have not yet been widely adopted by practitioners. A range of challenges face teachers and coaches taking up a GBA with two areas being of particular concern, which are: (1) the teacher’s ability to design practice games, analyze learning, and be able to make the necessary adjustments and (2) the effective use of productive and generative questioning. Although these issues are interrelated this article focuses on questioning to provide the attention that the literature suggests it requires with a focus on the practitioners’ implementation of GBA. After a brief discussion on theories of learning that support the use of questioning for learning in a GBA, the purpose of questioning is overviewed before the presentation of a range of specific questioning techniques for use in GBA.

Recent developments in the theorization of learning reflect a degree of frustration with the limitations of Western dualism and, in particular, with its separation of mind from body. These include the appropriation of the Buddhist concept of mindfulness in Positive Psychology and the concept of flow that has been applied to thinking about athlete performance in sport. This article follows on from this work to draw on the Japanese concept of mushin that underpins the practice of traditional martial arts and other cultural practices in Japan to explore the possibilities it offers for an holistic conception of learning. Translated by Suzuki as meaning 'no mind' in English, mushin describes a state reached through extended periods of training in which purity of action is made possible through the elimination of the interference of the conscious mind as a state of the unity of mind body and spirit.

Background: Over a period of four years, simulation has been increasingly integrated into the bachelor of nursing (BN) curriculum in a New Zealand school of nursing. The nursing lecturers teaching in the programme decided to conduct a small research project to establish if the use of simulation in nursing education adds value to the clinical experience for students.
Method: A qualitative, descriptive approach was chosen as the methodology. A voluntary purposeful sample of nursing students enrolled across the BN programme were invited to participate in a focus group interview. The participant group comprised 10 nursing students from semester two, first year, through to final semester, year three.
Findings: Analysis of the data indicates simulation does add value in preparing students for clinical practice and the findings are categorised under the following themes: Experience and feelings of participating in simulation; preparation for simulation; learning objectives/outcomes; value for clinical practice; and how simulation could be improved to better prepare students for clinical practice.

notes varying references to globalisation including “rampant capitalism, vast
international migration, ecological fragility, technological interconnectivity, cultural
hybridity, and reconfiguration of political power” (p.23). Responding to such
conceptions evoke varying possible service-learning approaches and multiple
responses dependent upon context. The purpose of this article is to open up different
ways of thinking about service-learning and to raise the level of debate about the
implications of selecting varying theoretical approaches within university settings.
Firstly, we will frame service-learning within a global context and consider the
implications of this. Secondly, we will offer traditional, critical and post-critical
conceptualisations of service-learning and provide a critique in order to promote debate
about contributions and limitations.
We began a journey toward understanding service-learning as a pedagogical tool while
teaching teacher education students primarily through a critical theoretical paradigm.
Service-learning is a pedagogical approach that combines community service with
classroom based preparation and reflection. Seeking outlets for teaching students to
take socio-critical action beyond the classroom, we found that service-learning had
something practical and tangible to offer. It became clear to us that while the vast
majority of service-learning projects drew upon traditional structural-functionalist
approaches, a number of teacher educators were exploring a critical approach to
service-learning and this reflected well with our own theoretical positioning. However,
while participating in a recent research study exploring shifting conceptualisations of
knowledge and learning, we began to critique critical service-learning approaches and
to consider other possibilities through an exploration of post-structural and post-colonial
theories. Consequently we have begun to conceptualise a post-critical approach to
service-learning and are interested in exploring the contribution that this possibility
could offer to the field of service-learning.",,,"Bruce, J., Brown. S. (2010) Conceptualising service-learning in global times.

island geography, isolation, and ubiquitous natural hazards. Wellington, the capital city, has vital needs for evacuation
preparedness and resilience to the devastating impacts and increasing uncertainties of earthquake and tsunami disasters.
While poor quality of life (QoL) is widely-associated with low levels of engagement in many health-protective behaviors,
the relationships among health-related quality of life (HrQoL), well-being, and preparedness are virtually unknown.
Methods: We hypothesized that QoL and well-being affect household evacuation preparedness. We performed a
quantitative epidemiologic survey (cross-sectional design) of Wellington adults. Our investigation assessed healthpromoting
attributes that build resiliency, conceptualized as health-protective attitudes and behaviors. Multidimensional
QoL variables were measured using validated psychometric scales and analyzed for associations with evacuation
preparedness, and we determined whether age and gender affected these relationships.
Results: We received 695 survey responses (28.5% response rate; margin of error ±3.8%; 80% statistical power to detect
true correlations of 0.11 or greater). Correlational analyses showed statistically significant positive associations with
evacuation preparedness for spiritual well-being, emotional well-being, and life satisfaction. No associations were found
for mental health, social well-being, or gender; physical health was weakly negatively associated. Evacuation
preparedness increased with age. Regression analyses showed that overall health and well-being explained 4.6-6.8% of
the variance in evacuation preparedness. Spiritual well-being was the only QoL variable that significantly and uniquely
explained variance in preparedness.
Conclusions: How well-being influences preparedness is complex and deeply personal. The data indicate that
multidimensional readiness is essential, and meaningfulness is an important factor. Inadequate levels of tangible
preparedness actions are accompanied by gaps in intangible readiness aspects, such as: 1) errors in perceived exposure
to and salience of natural hazards, yielding circumscribed risk assessments; 2) unfamiliarity with the scope and span of
preparedness; 3) underestimating disaster consequences; and 4) misinterpreting the personal resources required for
self-managing disaster and uncertainty. Our results highlight that conceptualizing preparedness to include attitudes and
behaviors of readiness, integrating well-being and meaningfulness into preparedness strategies, and prioritizing
evacuation planning are critical for resiliency as a dynamic process and outcome.",,,"Gowan, M.E., Kirk, R.C., Sloan, J.A.

Teachers’ perspectives of their professional learning activities challenge the way universities design formal online learning communities and highlight the potential for networked learning in the zones and intersections between professional practice and study.
The article extends the concepts of Lave and Wenger’s (1991) communities of practice social theory of learning by considering the role participants play in determining their engagement and connections in and across boundaries between online learning communities and professional practice.

Economic and dietary changes in the Indian state of Tamil Nadu have led to compromised oral health status of the adolescent population. Adequate epidemiological data are not available to address the prevention or treatment needs in this region of India. The aim of this study was to measure the prevalence and severity of dental caries among adolescents of Tamil Nadu, a southern state of India.


Methods

The study sample included 974 adolescent school students (12–15 years of age) from both rural and urban areas of Tamil Nadu, India. The decayed, missing and filled teeth (DMFT) index of these students was measured using the World Health Organization oral health survey method, in a quantitative cross-sectional study.


Results

The oral health survey indicated that the prevalence of dental caries among adolescents in rural and urban areas of Tamil Nadu was 61.4%, with an average DMFT score of 2.03. Multiple regression analyses indicated factors such as gender, mother's education, type of school and caste as significant predictors of dental caries.


Conclusion

Female gender, Scheduled Caste and Tribes attending public schools in rural areas were identified as the more vulnerable populations to be affected by dental caries.

However, the understanding of happiness (understood as eudaimonia) as being the utmost goal of human beings is hardly new. Philosophers have discussed this topic, under various terms, throughout history. One of the most recent philosophical concepts has been conducted by Wilhelm Schmid in his book Philosophie der Lebenskunst [Philosophy of the Art of Living], which is a theory about the good and beautiful life from a modern perspective under consideration of the philosophical history of this topic. Martin Seligman presented the ‘happiness formula’ in his book Authentic Happiness in 2002 and research about happiness, subjective well-being and life satisfaction (among others) began to form the field of positive psychology.

transitioning from local Aboriginal culture to the culture of professional sport provided
insight into this transitioning process while illuminating the profound importance of
culture in this process. It also helped identify the ways in which tensions between local
approaches to ‘footy’ as play and cultural expression and professional sport as work,
within the global culture of sport-as-business, were manifested in the challenges that the

Information is derived largely from archival records at the Institute of Education, London. These archives are not a complete record of the workings of the NEF in New Zealand or internationally. However, they provide a broad ranging record and give interesting insights into the thoughts and motivations of educators who were influential in determining New Zealand's education policy in the 1930s and 1940s. The recent decade has seen considerable debate about the nature and likely impact of recent administrative, curricular and assessment reforms in New Zealand schools (Olssen and Morris Matthews, 1997) In this context of rapid change it may be timely to recall an earlier time of strong public interest and debate about changes in primary and secondary education in New Zealand.
During the 1930s and 1940s the principles of education which would dominate curriculum and the system of provision for the next 50 years emerged as dominant forces. It was a time when a particular 'egalitarian' philosophy of public education was established. Today some would consider this philosophy to have been thoroughly compromised by recent developments. Others would consider it to have been rightly superseded. However, what consideration of the NEF in the 1930s
and 1940s probably best highlights is a time when educational debate and reform was more
democratic and genuinely open to a range of viewpoints than has been our recent experience.",,,"Abbiss, J.

Cues and prompts were used in this unit of work to help students use metacognitive strategies since students did not generally use metacognitive strategies spontaneously. Scaffolding was mediated through the teacher modelling, questioning, cueing or prompting students to evaluate their learning. The research reported here illustrates how teachers can cue students to be more self-directed in their learning. Three case studies illustrate how learning strategies were used differentially. Most students were aware of strategies that could help them to learn more effectively.

It describes the development of these classes, their learning environment and the teaching methods used. The period is a one in which predominantly young teachers of children in these classes endeavoured to create, in the absence of formal curriculum guidelines, programmes of learning for their pupils. Teachers and inspectors often questioned the restricting environment and methods used in these lower classes, and called for reforms encompassing, for example, the child-centred ideas of educationalists like Pestalozzi. The study suggests that the more progressive ideas and practices developed by teachers of young children indicated a resistance to using teaching methods and maintaining a learning environment unsuited to the needs of young children. This resistance helped fuel reforms in teaching and learning in infant classes that gradually influenced teaching and learning in other areas of the education system.",,,"Mackey, G.

The students completed the same questionnaire on four different occasions during their first block of professional teaching practice: after the observing lecturer visit; at a mid-placement meeting with their lecturer; at a one-to-one debriefing session with their lecturer; and after the marking of an assignment related to their professional teaching practice.

It investigates the motivating factors that encouraged them to undertake such tertiary studies and also introduces the implications for their families. For these six women, the role of mother seemed intrinsically tied to their motivation to train as teachers. Considerations relating to mothering (in part) also influenced when they began studying towards this career and influenced how they felt about these decisions and managed their study once at the college. However, the pressures of organizing their own children before and after school, spending more time away from the home, and relying on the support of other people to care for their children added to their feelings of stress and guilt. Those of us engaged in tertiary provision need seriously to consider the issues around motivation evident in the women's comments and what we can do to address them and thus provide inclusive education for this group. Students who are parents, and, it seems, especially those who are mothers, need to know that their tertiary study is of value to them and their families, and that the environment they are learning in supports their specific needs.",,,"White, Stephanie (2007) Mothers becoming teachers.

by a 6-week withdrawal block.
Results: Nine children with CAS made significant gains in their production of target speech
sounds and these demonstrated transfer of skills to connected speech for at least one speech
target. Eight children showed significant gains in at least one target phoneme awareness skill,
and these children demonstrated transfer of skills to novel phoneme awareness tasks. As a group

current school curricula; they must also prepare student teachers for entry into a teaching
environment that is likely to be very different from whence they came. At the same time,
funding constraints, quality standards and potentially opposed stakeholder expectations
provide an ongoing challenge.
The New Zealand school system is undergoing major change as it introduces a new national
curriculum focussed on outcomes. This new curriculum requires schools to design and review
their own curricula within the framework of national philosophy and guidelines rather than
according to prescriptions relating to the subjects that make up the curriculum. New Ministry
of Education initiatives targeting senior students and M ori and Pasifika students require
teachers to keep what is best for the student at the forefront of their teaching and decisionmaking.
ITE programmes must ensure these considerations are evident in their overarching
philosophy, course structure and practice.
Teacher education programmes at the University of Canterbury are currently under review. As
part of this process, we used the international Teacher Education for the Future project to help
us identify aspects of the programmes needing attention. We asked stakeholders (teachers,
student teachers and teacher educators) to rank the aims of education and their preferred future
focus for ITE programmes. This paper reports the findings and discusses their implication for
the design and facilitation of the university’s ITE courses.",,,"Conner, L., McGrath, A., Lancaster, N. (2008) Where to now for teacher education?

However, as these techniques are highly sensitive to motion artifacts and require a considerable amount of time for image acquisition, successful acquisition of these images can be challenging to complete with certain populations. This is especially true for young children. This paper describes a new approach termed the 'submarine protocol', designed to prepare 5- and 6-year-old children for advanced MRI scanning. The submarine protocol aims to ensure that successful scans can be acquired in a time- and resource-efficient manner, without the need for sedation. This manuscript outlines the protocol and details its outcomes, as measured through the number of children who completed the scanning procedure and analysis of the degree of motion present in the acquired images. Seventy-six children aged between 5.8 and 6.9 years were trained using the submarine protocol and subsequently underwent DTI and rfMRI scanning. After completing the submarine protocol, 75 of the 76 children (99%) completed their DTI-scan and 72 children (95%) completed the full 35-minute scan session. Results of diffusion data, acquired in 75 children, showed that the motion in 60 of the scans (80%) did not exceed the threshold for excessive motion. In the rfMRI scans, this was the case for 62 of the 71 scans (87%). When placed in the context of previous studies, the motion data of the 5- and 6-year-old children reported here were as good as, or better than those previously reported for groups of older children (i.e., 8-year-olds). Overall, this study shows that the submarine protocol can be used successfully to acquire DTI and rfMRI scans in 5 and 6-year-old children, without the need for sedation or lengthy training procedures. © 2014 Theys et al.",,,"Theys C, Wouters J, Ghesquière P (2014).

"18134","10092/458",,,"Small DT",,,,,,,,"2017",,,"New Caledonia is an anomoly. Surrounded by independent nations in the South-West Pacific, it remains a non-self governing territory of France. Some of the residents are recognised, even by France, as “citizens” of the “country” of New Caledonia. The indigenous Kanak people have not been reduced to the minority status of the indigenous peoples of the neighbouring settler states of Australia and New Zealand. But at 39 percent of the islands’ population in the latest census, the lowest proportion since records began, and facing an overwhelmingly anti-independence settler population, Kanak people approach next year’s self-determination vote with understandable anxiety about their future.
It is now almost thirty years since the New Caledonia’s increasingly violent independence struggle was brought back from the brink with the signing of the Matignon Accords. The peace agreement between the newly elected French Prime Minister, Michel Rocard, and the leaders of the main pro- and anti-independence groupings set out a ten-year process of development and social and economic “rebalancing” culminating in a vote on independence, a process extended by the Nouméa Accord in 1998.
This paper discusses the role of education in the Kanak independence struggle. It analyses how education became central to the struggle for Kanak socialist independence. It also examines ways in which differing ideas and strategies regarding educational challenges reflect different perspectives on Kanak social, cultural and political aspirations. It argues that these perspectives go to the heart of the future society Kanak people are seeking to construct in New Caledonia.",,,"Small DT (2017).

of children with CAS and children with inconsistent speech disorder (ISD).
Method & Procedures: Participants included twelve children with CAS aged 4–7 years. Their performance was compared with twelve children with ISD (and normal speech motor planning) and twelve children with typical development on tasks measuring phonological awareness, letter–sound knowledge, real and
non-word decoding, and access to underlying phonological representations of
words. There was no significant difference in the age, gender, socio-economic
status, and receptive vocabulary of the groups. The two groups with speech
disorder were matched for severity and inconsistency of their speech impairment.
Outcomes & Results: The results indicated that the CAS group had inferior phonological awareness than the ISD and typical development groups. The CAS group had a greater proportion of participants performing below their expected age level than the comparison groups on phonological awareness, letter–sound knowledge and decoding tasks. There was no difference in the performance of the CAS and ISD groups on the phonological representation task.
Conclusions & Implications: Children with CAS are particularly susceptible to
phonological awareness and reading delay. Intervention for children with CAS
must facilitate skills underlying reading development in addition to resolving
speech deficits in order to improve the spoke and written language outcomes of
this population.",,,"McNeill, B.C., Gillon, G.T., Dodd, B. (2009) Phonological awareness and early reading development in children with childhood apraxia of speech (CAS).

their child's oral health. The primary objective was to improve the oral health status of pre-schoolers and to prevent early childhood
caries.
Methods. 117 participants (parents of pre-schoolers) completed a self-administered oral health literacy questionnaire. Data obtained
from the study was analysed using a statistical package (SPSS). Firstly, descriptive analysis was undertaken generating tables
and graphs of socio-demographic variables. Later, associations between oral health literacy and socio-demographic variables
were identified and also the relationship between parents' oral health literacy and their attitude towards water fluoridation in Christchurch
was identified using bivariate and multivariable regression analysis. Psychometric analysis was generated to test the validity
and reliability of the oral health literacy questionnaire.
Results. In the total sample, 38% of participants had poor oral health literacy regarding their child's oral health. The results also
indicated that there were associations present between parents' oral health literacy and socio-demographic variables such as ethnicity,
education and family income in the regression analysis (F = 4.928, df = 21, p < 0.001, with R2 = 0.521). Nearly half of the parents
opted for water fluoridation in Christchurch. A strong association between parents' oral health literacy and their attitude towards
water fluoridation was identified (t = 3.021,df = 91.101;p < 0.004). Reliability was good for the developed oral health literacy
instrument (Cronbach's alpha = 0.691).
Conclusions. This study of parents' oral health literacy in Christchurch, New Zealand identified the association of oral health literacy
and socio-demographic variables which gives future guidance to improving the oral health status of New Zealand children. The
relationship between parents' oral health literacy and their attitude towards water fluoridation was shown in this study.",,,"Senthil, A., Kirk, R.

mainly from correlational self-report studies (Greenberg, Constantino, & Bruce,

The children were tested using a reading test (the Neale Analysis of Reading Ability, NARA) and were matched on the reading accuracy score produced by the test. Therefore in terms of the reading accuracy scores (and reading ages) derived from the NARA both groups were the same.

When the reading profile (i.e. accuracy, comprehension and speed) was examined in the same analysis no significant effect was revealed [d.f. = 1, 48; F = 0.05; p > 0.1], but a general lag for these children is suggested (in keeping with previous research). However, a closer analysis of the reading error profile revealed the most common reading errors made by all readers in the analysis were either mispronunciations or substitutions. The low vision readers were more prone to making substitution errors than mispronunciations and the reverse was true for normally sighted readers [d.f. = 1, 48; F = 7.1; p < 0.05].

Method: A questionnaire, using primarily solution-focused type questions, was distributed to all graduates. Interest was focused on specific events, both inside and outside the training programme and beyond, that contributed to graduates' sense of development as counsellors. Results: Thirty four graduates (response rate 62%) provided responses indicating their recognition that their sense of competence and identification as professional counsellors develops over time, and is assisted by relevant feedback and supervision from lecturers and practical counselling experience. Graduates also indicated that their favoured working model was solution-focused and that, as a framework, it provided them with opportunities to integrate other counselling models and add complementary professional development education.

Serum apolipoprotein concentrations may be a more sensitive indicator of coronary heart disease (CHD) risk than total cholesterol, triglycerides, low density lipoproteins and high density lipoproteins. Design: Thirty-seven sedentary, healthy adult males were randomly allocated to an exercise group (n=20) who underwent 12 weeks of aerobic physical activity or a sedentary group (n=17) who acted as nonexercising controls. Results: The exercise group increased their aerobic capacity (from 33±4 mL•kg-1•min-1 to 40±4 mL•kg-1•min-1) but the sedentary group did not. The percentage of body fat decreased in the exercise group (from 21.8% to 19.5%) but remained unchanged in the sedentary group. Serum cholesterol, lipoprotein and apolipoprotein concentrations did not change but serum triglyceride concentrations were reduced in the exercise group (from 1.8±1.3 mmol•L-1 to 1.2±0.4 mmol•L-1, p<0.05). The Apo-A1:Apo-B ratio increased in the exercise group (from 1.17±0.22 to 1.±0.27, p<0.05) but not in the sedentary group.

Methods: Participants (n = 12) were tested in three climbing conditions that were designed to invoke low, moderate and high physical and mental stress. Plasma cortisol concentrations were collected pre and post climbing and participants reported subjective anxiety and self confidence states for each climb. Results: Repeated measures analysis of variances showed significant differences between conditions for somatic anxiety (F2, 22 = 7.74, p = .009), self confidence (F2, 22 = 9.52, p = .001) and change in plasma cortisol concentration (F2, 22 = 3.71, p = .041). Pre planned polynomial comparisons showed these were linear effects somatic anxiety was higher in the higher stress conditions whilst self confidence was lower. Plasma cortisol concentration change was also linear Regression analyses showed cubic relationships between plasma cortisol concentration and cognitive anxiety (R2 = .452), self-confidence (R2 = .281) and somatic anxiety (R2 = .268).

Happiness is often portrayed, directly or indirectly, as one of the key aims of education. To suggest that education is concerned with promoting unhappiness or even despair would, in many contexts, seem outlandish. This paper challenges these widely held views. Focusing on the work of the great Russian writer, Fyodor Dostoevsky, I argue that despair, the origins of which lie in our reflective consciousness, is a defining feature of human life. Education, I maintain, should not be seen as a flight from despair but as a process of deepening our understanding of suffering and its potentially pivotal role in our humanisation. In developing these ideas, I draw on Kierkegaard’s The Sickness Unto Death and Unamuno’s The Tragic Sense of Life in Men and Nations, among other sources",,,"Roberts, P.

The Glass Bead Game is set in Castalia, a “pedagogical province” of the 23rd century. It is argued that the central character in the book, Joseph Knecht, undergoes a complex process of conscientisation. Knecht develops an increasingly critical understanding of Castalian society, questioning some of its most cherished assumptions while nonetheless deepening his appreciation of the beauty of the Glass Bead Game. He becomes less certain of his certainties as he grows older, and eventually decides to give away his prestigious post as Magister Ludi (Master of the Glass Bead Game) to pursue a quiet life as a tutor. Dialogue plays a key role in the development of Knecht’s critical consciousness. Freirean theory is seen to provide a robust framework for the analysis of key themes in Hesse’s text. At the same time, The Glass Bead Game is helpful in demonstrating the meaning and significance of conscientisation and dialogue for educational lives.",,,"Roberts, P.

H.H. relies too heavily on faith and abandons reason too quickly in seeking to become ‘absorbed’ into the Other he regards as his higher self.

This has been promoted in tandem with the notion of advancing New Zealand as a knowledge economy and society. The new patriotism encourages New Zealanders to accept, indeed embrace, a single, shared vision of the future: one structured by a neoliberal ontology and the demands of global capitalism. This constructs a narrow view of citizenship and reduces the possibility of economic and social alternatives being considered seriously. The paper makes this case in relation to tertiary education in particular. The first section outlines the New Zealand government's vision for tertiary education, as set out in the Tertiary Education Strategy, 2007–12 (Ministry of Education, 2006). This is followed by a critique of the Strategy and an analysis of the model of citizenship implied by it.

This enigmatic novel, with its deceptively simple narrative structure, lends itself well to multiple interpretations. To date, however, little attention has been paid by educationists to the book. This paper attempts to address this lacuna in the literature, beginning with an examination of the autobiographical and dream-like qualities of the novel. This is followed by a detailed analysis of the ritual of confession undertaken by H.H., the narrator and central figure in the book. H.H. lives in despair following the apparent dissolution of the League of Journeyers to the East. He seeks to overcome his despair, and learns the League is alive and well, through the character of Leo. At the end of the book H.H., having confessed his ‘sins’ and faced both his League brothers and himself, believes he has found the answer to his troubles. This paper argues that in his solution, H.H. fails to grasp of the importance of education, questioning and critique in self understanding and development. This being so, it is suggested, he will be unable to make the most of the knowledge available to him through the League archives, and his reflections on himself, Leo and the purpose of his existence will have only limited lucidity. He will, the paper concludes, have a long way to go on his journey to ‘the East’.",,,"Roberts, P.

However, the concept of ‘access’ and its measurement is complex. This paper aims to provide estimates of general practice visit frequencies for ‘attenders’ (those who seek consultation) and the proportion of ‘non-attenders’ (those who never seek consultation) of primary health care services.

Methods: A panel study of people enrolled within a large primary health care organisation of affiliated general practices. Standard and zero-inflated regression models were assessed.

Results: 980,918 visits were made by 388,424 people, averaging 2.64 visits/person/year. The zero-inflated negative binomial model was superior, and significant age, gender and ethnic differences were observed in attender and non-attender profiles. More Asian (21.0%), Pacific (19.6%) and Maori (17.1%) people were non-attenders than European/Other (9.0%) people. Among attenders, males, Asian and Pacific people, and young to middle-aged adults, generally had relatively lower visit rates.

Conclusions: Interpretation of utilisation data must be made with caution because of two distinct characteristics: the differential rates of non-attenders and the highly dispersed distribution of attenders.

Implications: Improved understanding of differential non-attender rates and attender visit distributions by demographic factors needs to be considered when addressing improved access to general practice services.",,,"Schluter, P.J., Bridgford, P., Cook, L., Hamilton, G.

2016, this article explores the notion of “enabling students to live a beautiful life” as a
possible end of education. A distinction is made between short-term, contextual aims in
education and overarching, encompassing end(s) of education. Following Dewey,
educational aims are considered to be manifold and to change over time within a sociocultural
context, whereas a proper end of education, if such a thing exists, could be seen as
“the best possible realization of humanity as humanity.” Drawing further on the work of R.
S. Peters, who contests the existence of any final end of education other than education
itself, it can be seen that proposing such an end can be a challenging undertaking.
Nevertheless, this article argues for a possible humanistic end of education, building on
Schmid’s philosophical concept of the art of living in conjunction with the German notion
of Bildung and Aristotle’s concept of phronesis, consolidating Peter’s and Dewey’s
positions. An argument is made that a, if not the end of education would be to support every
person as much as reasonably possible to develop their own art of living and live a good
and beautiful life. Resulting implications for schooling, curricula and education systems are
explored to show how education understood in such way transcends theory into practice.",,,,,,"2327-5731",,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/15650",,,,"en",,,,,,,,,,,,,"This is a SHERPA/RoMEO green journal. Its authors can archive pre-print and post-print or

Xerostomia has significant physical, social and psychological consequences which compromise function and quality of life. Pilocarpine is one treatment for xerostomia. Most studies have shown some variation in individual response to pilocarpine, in terms of dose used, and timing and extent of response.
We will determine a population estimate of the efficacy of pilocarpine drops (6 mg) three times daily compared to placebo in relieving dry mouth in palliative care (PC) patients. A secondary aim is to assess individual patients’ response to pilocarpine and provide reports detailing individual response to patients and their treating clinician.

Methods/Design: Aggregated n-of-1 trials (3 cycle, double blind, placebo-controlled crossover trials using standardized measures of effect). Individual trials will identify which patients respond to the medication. To produce a population estimate of a treatment effect, the results of all cycles will be aggregated.

Discussion: Managing dry mouth with treatment supported by the best possible evidence will improve functional status of patients, and improve quality of life for patients and carers.

Whereas registration may be regarded as an important unifying step in the professionalisation process (Wilenski, 1964), in this case it has exposed divisions within the New Zealand Association of Counselling and threatened to undermine advances that have been made to incorporate culturally sensitive practices into the association’s policies. In this paper, I use the content of two decades of Counselling Association publications alongside official registration documents and descriptions of local knowledge to illustrate how attempts to professionalise counselling expose the complementary use of two potentially conflicting forms of professionalism (Evetts, 2011): organisational professionalism (represented in the need to raise counselling membership standards for registration) and occupational professionalism (represented in the form of resistance to a process that will exclude some members because their traditional ways of working and local knowledge may not be accepted by a registration board). The basis of this potential conflict and associated complexity is the founding New Zealand constitutional document the Treaty of Waitangi that demands inclusion of the perspectives of New Zealand’s first peoples, Māori, in all public policies. At stake is a form of local knowedge: Māori theories of wellbeing and ways of working that have been
incorporated into the New Zealand Association of Counsellors’ policies but which may not be accepted as essential to the protocols associated with registration. As a case-study, it highlights that in a post-colonial society, both organisational and occupational professionalism are required to negotiate occupational change and both are interrupted when local knowledge is seen as a centrally important value.",,,"Miller, J.H.

"7667","10092/458",,,"Roberts, P.",,,,,,,,"2008",,,"More than a decade has now passed since Paulo Freire’s death in 1997. International interest in Freire’s work appears to be stronger than ever, with new conference papers and journal articles published on Freirean themes every year. Around a dozen books on Freire have appeared in the English language alone over the past ten years, and others are currently in production. This ongoing engagement with Freirean ideas has been given added impetus by the fact that new books by Freire himself continue to be released. Most of the posthumously published texts appeared in the period immediately following Freire’s death (e.g., Freire, 1998a, 1998b, 1998c), but other writings that had previously enjoyed only limited circulation are still being assembled into book form. One of the most recent examples is Pedagogy of Indignation, published by Paradigm in 2004.
Pedagogy of Indignation (Freire, 2004) includes a series of letters and short essays by Freire, most written in the last years of his life. These are preceded by a Foreword (by Donaldo Macedo), a prologue (by Ana Maria Araújo Freire), and a letter (by Balduino Andreola). Freire addresses an eclectic range of topics in the essays and letters – social change, literacy, technology, adult education, hope, and utopia, among other subjects – and in so doing he revisits, reworks and extends key themes in his philosophy of education. Here, as in previous publications, Freire’s approach in tackling any subject involves reflection on deeper theoretical questions: What does it mean to be a human being? How do we come to know? How ought we to structure society? What are some of the impediments to the pursuit of human ideals? These underlying ontological, epistemological, ethical, and political questions are really the heart of the book.
While there is not a great deal here that is new for readers well versed in Freire’s work, the combination of themes is distinctive and some of the answers Freire gives to longstanding questions differ in subtle ways from those provided in earlier published writings. There is, for instance, greater attention paid to the importance of willing in human life. Freire’s critique of technicist modes of thought also finds fresh attention in these pages. The relationship between reason and emotion is explored here, as it was in other later works, and Freire’s concern with ecological issues is also evident.",,,"Roberts, P.

The built environment is acknowledged as an important factor in understanding children's ATS, alongside parental factors and seasonality. Inconsistencies in methodological approaches exist, and a clear understanding of factors related to ATS remains equivocal. The purpose of this study was to gain a better understanding of associates of children's ATS, by considering the effects of daily weather patterns and neighbourhood walk ability and neighbourhood preferences (i.e., for living in a high or low walkable neighbourhood) on this behaviour.

METHODS: Data were drawn from the Understanding Relationships between Activity and Neighbourhoods study, a cross-sectional study of physical activity and the built environment in adults and children in four New Zealand cities. Parents of participating children completed an interview and daily trip diary that assessed their child's mode of travel to school, household and individual demographic information, and parental neighbourhood preference. Daily weather data were downloaded from New Zealand's national climate database. Geographic information systems-derived variables were calculated for distance to school and neighbourhood walkability. Bivariate analyses were conducted with ATS and potential associates; factors related to ATS at p less than 0.20 were considered simultaneously in generalized estimation equation models, and backwards elimination of non-significant factors was conducted; city was treated as a fixed effect in all models.

RESULTS: A total of 217 children aged 6.5-15 years participated in this study. Female sex, age, city, household income, limited/no car access, residing in zone of school, shorter distance to school, neighbourhood self selection, rainfall, and sunlight hours were simultaneously considered in multivariate generalised estimation equation modelling (all p less than 0.20 in bivariate analyses). After elimination of non-significant factors, age (p = 0.005), shorter distance to school (p less than 0.001), city (p = 0.03), and neighbourhood self selection (p = 0.04) remained significantly associated with ATS in the multivariate analysis.

CONCLUSION: Distance to school is the prevailing environmental influencing factor on children's ATS. This study, in conjunction with previous research, suggests that school siting is likely an important associate of children's ATS.",,,"Oliver, M., Badland, H., Mavoa, S., Witten, K., Kearns, R., Ellaway, A., Hinckson, E., Mackay, L., Schluter, P.J.

METHODS: An electronic cross-sectional survey of doctors currently in the paid workforce, conducted between April 2008 and October 2009, was nested within a longitudinal cohort study investigating factors affecting the recruitment and retention of the Australian medical workforce. To address the specific aims of this study, a subset of questions in the survey investigated the prevalence of self-reported bullying; physical and mental health; workforce participation patterns; job satisfaction; and job stressors.

RESULTS: Seven hundred and forty-seven participants responded to the bullying question and were included in this analysis. Twenty-five percent of participants reported being bullied in the last 12 months. There were no differences in the reported rates of bullying across age groups, sex and country of medical qualification. Bullied doctors were least satisfied with their jobs (P less than 0.001), had taken more sick leave in the last 12 months (P less than 0.001), and were more likely to be planning to decrease the number of hours worked in medicine in the next 12 months (P=0.01) or ceasing direct patient care in the next 5 years (independent of their age or the number of hours currently worked in patient care) (P=0.006).

While the rate of change in education can sometimes be overwhelming in Bangladesh, school leadership still largely follows a hierarchical model. The principal is often seen as the person who makes a school successful and they also act as the gatekeepers to transform a school through change initiatives. School principals in Bangladesh struggle with the practical realities of management in a school system that is itself undergoing change. There is some recognition of the need to distribute some of the power to teachers for successful school change. In this paper we explore to what extent the urban principals in Dhaka city are moving towards distributed leadership for effective change.

Design and Subjects: Cross-sectional study of 80 children (age: 2 - 5 y, 29% overweight or obese), 73 mothers (37% overweight or obese), and 22 fathers (72% overweight or obese), residing in Auckland, New Zealand, between October 2006 and July 2007. 

Measurements: Body size was determined using waist circumference and body mass index (BMI). Child exposure to TV was assessed by questionnaire (number of household TV sets, presence of TV in the child’s bedroom, mean TV/movie watching hours on weekdays and weekend days), and physical activity by 7 days of accelerometry. 

Results: Compared with children of normal weight/underweight mothers (classified by BMI status), the age-adjusted odds of a child being overweight/obese if their mother was overweight/obese/otherwise was 2.46 (95% CI 1.11, 5.48, P = 0.03). No other associates of child body size were identified.

This study aims to identify modifiable perceived resources and barriers to PA among New Zealand adults.

METHODS: Secondary analysis of a 2003 nationally representative cross-sectional mail survey, stratified by region, age, and ethnicity, and analyzed utilizing ordinal logistic regression.

RESULTS: Overall, n = 8038 adults responded to the survey, of whom 49% met updated guidelines for sufficient PA. Perceived accessibility of local resources was associated with PA; however, for some resources there was more awareness among individuals whose predominant activity was not commonly associated with that resource (eg, health clubs and walkers). Perceived local environmental barriers demonstrated negative (steep hills, crime, dogs) and positive (unmaintained footpaths) associations. The absence of perceived environmental barriers was strongly associated with increased activity, suggesting the number of barriers may be a critical factor.

CONCLUSION: Complex relationships between perceptions of local environments and activity patterns among adults were found. Although complex, these results demonstrate positive associations between awareness of resources and perceived lack of barriers with being sufficiently physically active for health. Therefore, investments in provision and/or promotion of local resources have the potential to enable active healthy communities.",,,"Garrett, N., Schluter, P.J., Schofield, G.

"10732","10092/672",,,"Roberts, P.",,,,,,,,"2007",,,"Teaching is often conceived in terms of methods and skills. When different approaches to teaching are discussed, the focus is commonly on teaching techniques; on the methods believed to be most effective in enabling students to learn. It is not always clear what students are expected to learn, but hopes of improved performance on standardised tests of student achievement usually figure prominently in such discussions. Considerable resources are devoted to researching and implementing schemes for producing better methods and better teaching. The hope is that not only individual test scores but national performances in surveys of international educational achievement (e.g., comparisons between OECD countries) will be boosted as a result of this investment of time, money and effort. The assumption is that if we change the methods, or ‘fix’ the teacher, or increase the funding, some of our most important educational problems will be solved. Teaching, on this view, becomes a largely technical process. It is taken as given that if we ‘get the methods right’ – and these may be not only methods of teaching, but also of training teachers – all will be well.
This chapter offers an alternative view – one based on the work of the Brazilian educationist Paulo Freire. Freire was one of the most influential educationists of twentieth century, and his work continues to attract attention across the globe today. Freire argued that teaching is never merely about skills and methods. From a Freirean perspective, both teaching and learning are always non-neutral, political and ethical processes. For Freire, methods and skills are not unimportant, but their role in teaching must be considered in relation to a broader understanding of human beings and the world. The first part of this chapter outlines key elements of Freire’s educational philosophy, while the second considers some of the implications of Freirean theory for teacher education and teaching practice. The chapter concludes with brief reflections on strengths and weaknesses in Freire’s work, and with some final comments on the significance of teaching in changing lives.",,,"Roberts, P.

Educational materials that validate Maori identity, tikanga and te reo Maori, and that accurately and positively reflect the readers’ lives and values through text and images are an important part of the educational experience for Maori students. Equally, any study of those educational experiences, inclusive of materials produced to support learning and teaching in the Maori medium context, will be best achieved by researchers who are themselves positioned within the community being researched. Only then can Maori-centred research projects satisfy the research demands of kaupapa Maori education, because the research is positioned within the community and is accountable to community – kura, whanau, hapu and iwi. This is a Maori-centred research approach that produces findings that are relevant and meaningful with a view to improved reo Maori outcomes for akonga.
This report provides a summary and clarification of the issues identified by the research participants and literature in relation to the development of Maori language resources. It has three main sections. The first section describes the structure of the project, the research methodology which guided this project and further relevant literature which contextualises the study.
The second section focuses on the questions which this study sought to answer and discusses the issues raised by the research participants. A range of strategies to address those issues are suggested in the discussions, including areas for further research and development.
The third section, te pumanawa o te whakaaro, te kiko o te kaupapa, is an exposé of the data integrated into the relevant sections.

especially during their time at school.
To date, our has study shown that while some children are more resistant to
stress, other children are sensitive to changes in their surroundings and find it
difficult to cope with stress. This sensitivity to stress is likely to be caused by the
children’s exposure to many unsettling earthquakes before they were four years
of age.
We have found an increase in the number of children who have difficulty feeling
settled in the classroom, compared to our pre-earthquake study, which is
probably due to their earthquake related experiences. This means that some
children might be irritable at school and feel nervous or tense and as a result,
they may have difficulty in controlling their temper and expressing themselves in
a positive and pro-social way. This stress reaction might also be getting in the
way of their learning. They are not behaving this way on purpose. These
children are sensitive to stress and it is more difficult for them to develop positive
coping strategies.",,,"Liberty K, Macfarlane S, Hooper L, Allan, M (2015). Te Ru Tamariki: A Study of Juniors Settling into School and Learning: Parent Report.

The submission identifies a number of positive features of the document. However much of the submission focuses on its limitations. These include the lack of recognition of organisations such as the WEAs, the apparent lack of appreciation of 
the potential benefits and breadth of scope of ACE, the limited understanding of adult 
learners and their learning, including their achievements in ACE programmes and in formal tertiary studies, and the apparent failure to recognise that the contributions of 
tertiary education institutions should go beyond the constraints of credentialing and include ACE programmes which are credential-free. The submission argues that several of these limitations are likely to reduce the

This study focuses on how teachers in an infant and toddler centre connect key ideas from Te

analyse data gathered from centre policy documents, a group interview, and several children's
profile books.
Three focus ideas are presented including, parental contribution in their child's profile books,
terminology used in the documents and how the centre is adapting to taking up a sociocultural
approach to assessment. Findings show parental contributions to the profile books
are in fact one aspect that is linking the family and community to the centre. Terminologies
used in the centre's documents show a mixture of developmental and socio-cultural terms and
reflect the language used by the teachers who are interviewed. The teachers' approach to a
socio-cultural understanding about assessing children's learning is revealed to be developing
through professional development run at the centre. Ultimately, the study shows the teachers
to be in the early stages of a transition from developmental based practices to a socio-cultural

The current state of research identifies contradictions in terms and inconsistencies in its usage, and gaps in the literature – as one commentator put it almost zero with respect to indigenous ITE and absolutely no publications on proficiency levels of teachers graduating from ITE or on defining teacher language proficiencies. Be that as it may, this review provides further ideological clarification around the meanings and understandings ascribed to associated terms, for example bilingualism, immersion education, proficiency, competency, fluency, indigenous language curriculum, heritage languages, communicative approaches, subtractive and additive bilingual programmes. It also overviews how the nature of reo Māori proficiency that ITE providers can expect of their graduating kaiako is affected by a very wide range of factors which spring from the general socio-historical, political and linguistic conditions of the context/s concerned. Some of the wider (organisational and pedagogical) Māori language education aims are amenable to direct management by ITE providers. Even so, the wider socio-historical and political pressures will often impinge upon the extent to which ITE providers can give effect to its aims through its programmes. The literature strongly suggests that the new development of a full education system in a particular language in any country requires consistent and large resources focussed on it. In the case of Aotearoa/New Zealand, relevant and coherent policies need to be developed, based on sound research and development praxis. Significantly increased resources need to go into te reo Māori advancement in ITE in order to produce sufficient numbers of graduating kaiako with reo Māori proficiencies that are appropriate for teaching in both the compulsory and non-compulsory education sectors.

This qualitative study explored the first month of attendance and focused on: i) how the children became valued members of a peer group (facilitative inclusion) and whether the processes differed for the children with DS, ii) how the typically developing children experienced the child with DS and iii) the extent to which the experiences of children with DS were dependent on the broader socio-cultural context. Results indicated that the typically developing children experienced inclusion into same status roles including the most advanced forms of these (parallel play and social play) virtually always when they interacted with peers. In contrast, peers often excluded the children with DS from any valid role or included them into inferior roles (e.g. baby or object). Peers were often unsure how to include the child with DS and used their existing schema to view her/him as a baby or they developed new categories for understanding the child such as ‘mystery’ or ‘not like me.’ Unequal relationships or avoidance of the child stemmed from such beliefs. The lack of facilitative inclusion had major implications for the children’s social and cognitive development. Investigation into the processes underlying the outcomes in each setting indicated a number of barriers. While all staff were enthusiastic about the presence of the child with DS, there were discrepancies between their understandings, and practices, of inclusion and the intentions underlying the various inclusion policies in New Zealand.

Objective and methods
The objectives of the research project were to:
- Examine the contribution of rongoa Maori to indigenous wellbeing, and - Identify issues for the ongoing sustainability of traditional Maori healing in New Zealand.
The research process was lead by Maori researchers in collaboration with Maori healers and stakeholders.
Two literature reviews were undertaken; one to provide understanding of international developments in
traditional medicine, and a second to review national policy/literature related to rongoa Maori. Four focus
groups and five workshops were held with groups in five communities to explore current rongoa practice
and service delivery and drivers/barriers to its ongoing utilisation. The participant groups were healers and
their associates, and health and local authority stakeholders.",,,"Ahuriri-Driscoll, A., Baker, V., Hepi, M., Hudson, M., Mika, C., Tiakiwai, S (2008) The future of rongoa Maori: wellbeing and sustainability..

education in New Zealand, Gordon and Morton (2008) argue that there needs
to be more research into “what kinds of choices are offered to disabled
children and their families” (p.248) in order to find out how the policy of
“choice” impacts on disabled children and their families.
The aim of the Families choices: Choosing School(s) project is to describe the
kinds of choices parents, caregivers, and/or whänau face when their disabled
child or children start school, or change school. What kinds of decisions do
parents have to make? What sorts of things influence those decisions? The
project targets the experiences of families whose son or daughter has had an
application made for ORRS funding under the criteria of ‘learning’ or
‘language use and social communication.’ The application for ORRS did not
have to be successful.
This report covers Part 1 of the project. The aim of Part 1 was to develop a
questionnaire to be used in a national survey of parents. The development
has been informed by a review of New Zealand and international literature
looking at the decisions parents made about where their disabled children
went to school. There appear to be few empirical studies of this kind. The
review identified three groupings of factors that shaped parents experiences
and decisions: factors related to the prevailing attitudes and philosophies in
the school; factors related to the school environment and educational
provision and factors that are idiosyncratic to the child (including for example
that their siblings attend the same school).
These factors were explored in more depth with five New Zealand parents.
The parents were interviewed to determine the applicability of questions used
in other survey studies. The interviews and the literature review provided the
foundation for the development of questions and response categories for a
questionnaire for a Part 2 study.
This report also describes a sampling strategy for Part 2 of the project. Data
from Education Counts provided figures for the numbers of students enrolled
in schools by year group, including special schools. Data from the ORRS scheme provided the numbers of students who applied for ORRS funding in
each of the 17 GSE defined regions in New Zealand. Part 2 of the project
needs to receive 1400 completed surveys to achieve a nationally
representative sample that includes sufficient numbers in the smallest
smallest regions. Three approaches to sending and receiving surveys are
suggested.",,,"Morton, M., McMenamin, T. (2009) Families Choices: Choosing School(s). Part 1: Literature review, interviews and design of the questionnaire.

across qualifications of initial teacher education in Aotearoa New Zealand. The study was
conducted in two phases. Data from publicly-available documentation of the 27 providers of
initial teacher education were recorded in an electronic data base as a means of compiling
individual profiles of each qualification. Subsequently, twenty-five providers participated in
interviews to ensure that profiles accurately reflected the policy and practice of the
qualification. Qualification profiles were reviewed to identify common and distinctive
characteristics of initial teacher education according to sector (early childhood, primary and
secondary), type of qualification and type of provider. Findings were considered within a
framework of contemporary national and international research and implications identified
for future research, policy and practice in initial teacher education.
This project confirms that initial teacher education is incredibly complex and multi-faceted
and that New Zealand qualifications reflect many of the achievements and the challenges of
implementing quality teacher education that are experienced internationally. The official
documentation reveals that there is a general lack of explicit coherence among components
of many qualifications, that in some cases there is no clearly articulated conceptual or
theoretical base underpinning qualifications, and, that, in the documentation of many
qualifications, there are conspicuous silences surrounding aspects of initial teacher education
critical to the New Zealand context. There is also evidence that the regulatory and
compliance environment within which providers operate is sometimes perceived as
distracting, rather than ensuring quality.
This national project has enabled us to identify key areas for further and ongoing attention
both by individual providers of initial teacher education and, more importantly, by the
professional community of teacher education in collaboration with the Ministry of
Education, the New Zealand Teachers Council and others. We need to determine, and thence
articulate more clearly, the fundamental goals of initial teacher education and to demonstrate
how programmes of ITE are coherent in their underlying values, goals, design, curriculum,
pedagogy and implementation. There is a need also to consider how current external quality
assurance processes can be made more coherent with fundamental goals of initial teacher
education and the research on theory and practice that underpins these goals.",,,"Kane, R.G., Burke, P., Cullen, J., Davey, R., Jordan, B., McCurchy-Pilkington, C., Mansell, R., MacIntyre, L., Scrivens, C., Simpson, M., Stephens, C., Waiti, P., Butler, P., Godin-McKerras, L.

The purposes of the review were defined as follows:
1. To undertake a literature review of national and international developments in IEP processes and special education assessment practice to contribute to the Ministry of Education’s current project to review, revise and position the Individual Education Programme (IEP) Guidelines in relation to: the New Zealand Curriculum (Ministry of Education 2007), current assessment practices, effective teaching and learning practices, and engagement and reporting to parents, family and whanau (National Standards).
2. To provide both New Zealand and international research evidence of effective and/or evidence based practice, which, along with the data being collected by the Ministry of Education project team, will ultimately inform the future use of IEPs. 
The scope of the review was defined as follows:
1. The focus of the review is to be on: students with special needs in all school sector settings, students as learners, not the disability or the diagnosis they present with, the use of IEPs with schools and parents, the role of special education staff and other agencies in the IEP process, and what makes the IEP process effective for schools, students and their families, and what evidence there is of their effectiveness, with particular reference to the educational implications.

healthcare needs (World Health Organization (WHO) 2003). Since the late 1970s, the WHO has promoted
traditional medicines internationally. Now the popularity of traditional medicines is increasing, and their
use is spreading among urban populations in many industrialised countries.
The growth in interest in, and utilisation of, traditional medicine and healing practices has led to varying
degrees of integration with the dominant westernised approach to medicine. However, scepticism remains
among indigenous peoples about whether successful integration and acceptance within modern health
systems is possible.
In New Zealand, traditional healing has a long history of usage and credibility among Maori. Recently, a
research project was completed that looked into the current status of traditional Maori healing and its
contribution to wellbeing, and the integration of rongoa Maori with mainstream healthcare to sustain the
practice. A Maori research/inquiry paradigm guided the research. The project was informed by a national
literature review, and focus groups and workshops with traditional healers and rongoa Maori stakeholders.
This work provided direction about the research required to support the integration of rongoa Maori with
mainstream healthcare.

It investigates using complexity thinking firstly, to occasion emergence (i.e., create a new phenomenon) in children‟s games of chase at an early childhood centre and secondly, to describe this emergence.
This final report to SPARC presents a local curriculum theory for games of chase at the centre which explains the design (curriculum design) and describes how the games of chase curriculum unfolded (curriculum dynamics). The local curriculum theory, curriculum design and curriculum dynamics are underpinned by the discourse of complexity thinking.
This research involved taking the role of a volunteer teacher-researcher-curriculum designer at an early childhood centre to play games of chase with children. This role was informed by and contributed to the curriculum design that focused on designing the teaching and learning environment to occasion emergence in learning and curriculum.
The games of chase curriculum contributed to children‟s learning, my own learning and the general rhythm at the centre. The children learnt to distinguish between children who were playing and those who were not. They also learnt to tag in different ways. In addition, the children and I developed a game playing routine before playing each game. This routine involved putting on tag belts, discussing what game we were playing and how we were going to play it. We played three different games of chase, starting with tag, followed by What is the time Mr(s) Wolf? and finally the emergent game Big A, Little A.
The curriculum dynamics or enacted curriculum is described in terms of narratives related to three curriculum-related phenomena, i.e., teaching, activities related to games of chase, and children‟s learning in, through and about games of chase.
This research suggests that teachers who are interested in exploring games of chase at their own centres can use the local curriculum theory presented here as a starting point for their own explorations. Using the local curriculum theory implies adapting the curriculum design presented here to fit the local teaching situation and drawing relevant insights from the curriculum dynamics that unfolded in this research. In this way, the teacher can be seen as using complexity thinking to expand on teaching, learning and curriculum possibilities in his/her own setting.",,,"Hussain, H.B.

This Positive Youth Development in Aotearoa (PYDA) framework seeks to explore the confluence between the various approaches to PYD documented in local and international literature, with the grass roots experiences of young people and organisations in Aotearoa / New Zealand. We hope to promote fresh thinking by those working with young people and the funding providers supporting them. This includes both private and public funders of adolescent focused programmes across a range of professions (social work, youth work, education, counselling, social services, corrections, justice etc), as well as managers, programme leaders and programme designers, the adults working with young people as well as parents, communities and young people themselves.
In essence this PYDA framework suggests that both informal and formal initiatives, activities and programmes intentionally weave connections by intergrating two key focuses and adopting three key approaches;Key Outcomes
1) Developing the whole person.
2) Developing connected communities.
Key Approaches
1) Strength based.
2) Respectful relationships.
3) Building ownership and empowerment.In the following pages each of these components is explored and linked to the experiences of young people in Canterbury who have come into contact with youth development organisations.
The Positive Youth Development in Aotearoa framework (PYDA) has been developed by the Youth Advisory Group (YAG) for the Wayne Francis Charitable Trust (WFCT) a Christchurch-based private family philanthropic Trust. The Trust’s funding focus is on young people from 0-25 years. As part of its strategic approach WFCT commissioned the YAG to develop criteria against which organisations and projects being considered could be assessed as to whether they supported young people appropriately. This document has grown out of research commissioned by WFCT in 2009 and originally published in the Youth Studies Australia journal, ‘Youth Work that is of value: Towards a model of best practice’.",,,"Jansen, C., Bruce, J., Williams, A., Campbell, J., Pawson, P., Harrington, J., Major, D.

"18558","10092/2576",,,,"Lovett, Susan",,,,,,,"2016",,,"Purpose : This literature review has been commissioned by the Te Ariki Trust so that future applicants for the David Stewart Memorial Postgraduate Scholarship may benefit from access to a select literature review in order to understand the essence of the Trust’s four values. These four values underpin all work associated with the Trust. The intention of the scholarship is that it will provide a postgraduate study opportunity for a school leader to advance and honour the work of David Stewart. The aim of the review is to provide a repository which can be consulted when applicants consider how they might build on David Stewart’s legacy as they devise their scholarship proposals.
The Trust in selecting a scholarship recipient, looks for evidence of an intellectual challenge which will help school leaders make sense of the complex issues they encounter in daily leadership work in New Zealand primary schools. The recipient is expected to continue the theme of how school leaders can develop teachers as reflective professional practitioners working within collaborative school cultures. Scholarship applicants will need to show in their proposals how the process of education is indeed an intellectual activity in which professionals co-construct meaning from their practice in conversation and observation with colleagues to develop better ways of meeting students’ learning need in the classroom. Applicants will also need to familiarise themselves with the work of David Stewart in order to honour and continue the work he started with New Zealand school principals. The articles featured in the review provide applicants with national and international literature to show the direction taken by recent research studies which, as well as providing insights from their own work, have signalled where future work is needed.

The four values : Four values guide the work of the Te Ariki Trust. These are ‘professional discretion’, ‘collegial obligations’, ‘reflective inquiry and discourse’ and ‘evidenced based professional practice’. The literature review canvasses all four of these values knowing that each is underpinned by an extensive body of literature. As a select literature review, the focus on scholarship and research is limited to studies undertaken since the year 2010.

Process : The review examines up to five significant studies for each Te Ariki value. These are presented as annotated bibliographies followed by a summarising document bringing out the major messages across the four values. The review highlights what current literature has to say about each of the Te Ariki values and why such values are important for principal and teacher development when working as colleagues who are committed to making a difference to students’ learning.",,,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/14982",,,"en",,,,,"University of Canterbury for the Te Ariki Trust",,,,,,,,,,"https://nzei.org.nz/documents/email/te-ariki-final-report.pdf",,"Field of Research::13 - Education::1303 - Specialist Studies in Education::130304 - Educational Administration, Management and Leadership||Field of Research::22 - Philosophy and Religious Studies::2201 - Applied Ethics::220107 - Professional Ethics (incl. police and research ethics)",,,,,,,,"Values for New Zealand school leadership : literature review for the Te Ariki Trust",,,"Reports",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

less effective than teaching strategies that are learner-centred and that promote active

research to develop resources to improve learning in university science courses. We
report on a successful adaptation and implementation of CWSEI in the New Zealand
university context.
This two-year project at Massey University and the University of Canterbury began by
using perception and concept surveys before and after undergraduate science courses
to measure students’ attitudes towards science as well as their knowledge. Using these
data, and classroom observations of student engagement and corroborating focus
groups, the research team worked with lecturers to create interventions to enhance
student engagement and learning in those courses. Results show several positive
changes related to these interventions and they suggest several recommendations for
lecturers and course coordinators. The recommendations include:1. Make learning outcomes clear, both for the lecturer and the students; this
helps to cull extraneous material and scaffold student learning.
2. Use interactive activities to improve engagement, develop deeper levels of
thinking, and improve learning.
3. Intentionally foster “expert-like thinking” amongst students in the first few
semesters of the degree programme.
4. Be flexible because one size does not fit all and contextual events are
beyond anyone’s control.In addition to these recommendations, data collected at the Canterbury site during
the 2010 and 2011 earthquakes reinforced the understanding that the most carefully
designed teaching innovations are subject to contextual conditions beyond the control
of academics.",,,"Kennedy, B., Brogt, E., Jordens, Z., Jolley, A., Bradshaw, R., Hartnett, M., O’Steen, B., Hartung, E., Soutter, A., Cartwright, G., Burr, N.

tertiary education sector and takes place alongside the formal sector. This research
project focuses on what prompts women to engage in ACE and the subsequent
impact on their lives. Furthermore, it will define the features of successful learning
environments within ACE as identified by the women participants. In particular, the
research concentrates on women who participated in non-accredited and nonvocational
ACE programmes in a range of community-based contexts. Underpinned
by social constructionist and interpretivist understandings, this inquiry focuses
primarily on particular impacts in the social and personal development of women
involved in ACE.

Qualitative data collection methods were used, by exploring women’s experiences in
face-to-face interviews. Key themes highlighted women’s involvement in ACE was an opportunity for women to meet new people, manage the impact of social
isolation and to experience and/or enjoy the mutual support of other women. ACE 
was also undertaken for practical reasons such as financial accessibility and fewer
barriers to participation. Other themes identified were around opportunities
available for women to develop their confidence and enhance their personal
development. For some women, this subsequently had positive impacts on their
families.

An unexpected finding from these results was, for some women, participation in ACE
was primarily for social and personal development as opposed to a focus on
credentialing and vocational skills. In contrast to previous literature, the research
project provides little evidence of limitations imposed by conventional ideas of
women’s roles or a lack of participants’ confidence restricting their participation in
ACE courses. These results have provided a new picture of the meaning of ACE in
women’s lives. The study is a reminder of the importance of diverse programme
provision which women value for various reasons.",,,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/13320",,,"en","English",,,,"University of Canterbury",,,,,,,"http://library.canterbury.ac.nz/thesis/etheses_copyright.shtml","All Rights Reserved",,,,,,,,,,,,"The Impact of Adult and Community Education on Women’s Lives",,,"Electronic Thesis or Dissertation",,,"Education","University of Canterbury",,"Masters",,,"Master of Education",,"2467662",,,"College of Education, Health and Human Development, University of Canterbury",,"jennifer.leahy@clear.net.nz",,,,,,,,,"Dr Marion Bowl"

The underpinning structure is Dewey’s developmental spiral (1933) that enables me to use the writing of this thesis as a reflective process. This practice consists of reflecting on past experience, exploring and critiquing the influence of neoliberalism as a significant hindrance in maintaining effective self-care. I also deconstruct relevant discursive formations by employing the theoretical approaches that are positioned in the social constructionist arena, and consult the writings of Foucault, De Certeau, Wittgenstein, and other theorists. I revisit personal historical occurrences linking them to societal settings. For this I use auto-ethnography as the methodology, exploring my adoption of early discursive formations and in particular the way I used work as a coping mechanism. For the conceptualisation that describes new constructive ways of being, I use the solution-focused therapeutic approach to overcome the problems of being enmeshed with the discussed hegemonic discourses. The last part of the Dewey’s developmental spiral explores new experiences that have been influenced by the reflective process described earlier.

A foundation of Pasifika epistemologies comprising talanoa, teu le vā and Fa’aSamoa was used to validate Pasifika ways of knowing as essential forms of knowledge to be used in research for, and by, Pasifika peoples. Western theories of Womanism and critical race theory were also used to support this Pasifika foundation. Every researcher’s life shapes both the question and approach to research. Therefore, the thesis begins with self-narratives from the researcher, supporting the methodology of autoethnography to add depth and richness to the data. The findings revealed that women’s actions were influenced by their values of Fa’aSamoa, cultural beliefs and social motivators of hope and fear within the New Zealand context. Samoan women were poutu (the main pole) that upheld family, church and work within A’oga Amata (licensed Samoan early childhood centres). As immigrants from Samoa, women overcame challenges as a minority culture; and created new spaces for Samoan families. With the support of the church, A’oga Amata became a place of cultural transmission, a place of belonging and also a place where women experienced new confidence, leadership roles and higher status within their own homes, churches and community. Unfortunately, colonial incursions of licensing regulations, teacher qualifications and western ideals of quality teaching undermined the work that was created by these pioneering women. These findings reveal serious implications for A’oga Amata where language, culture and the identity of Samoan children in New Zealand is threatened and lost if cultural incursions continue to exist.

the majority culture. This means that often the learning needs of minority groups is not
taken into account, which can compromise their educational attainment as indicated by
trends in national and international data. International schools are an increasingly popular
option in what is fast becoming a globalised education system. These schools have
significant student diversity in terms of cultural background and languages. This study
investigates how multicultural education and culturally responsive practices are
implemented in an international school context. Most research on diversity in education is
based in monoculture schools. Therefore, this research study sought to understand what is
done in international schools to cater for diverse learners.
This study was conducted as an exploratory case study of an international school by
engaging with a sample of teachers and key administration members of the school.
Interviews, fieldwork and classroom observations were conducted to answer the
overarching research question: How are multicultural education and culturally responsive
practices being implemented in an international school context? As a teacher in the school,
I undertook this study from the role of an ‘insider observer’ where I was immersed within
the community and able to participate in their daily life.
The findings from the study show that while there is some alignment with multicultural and
culturally responsive practices, there is little explicit focus on, or support for, these
practices by administrators and teachers. These findings suggest there are both implications
for practices in international schools and for furthering research within international
schools, such as the need to pay more explicit attention to Professional Development, and
Data Recording. There is also a need for more research on international schools that
examines school and classroom practices.",,,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/13363",,,"en","English",,,,"University of Canterbury",,,,,,,"http://library.canterbury.ac.nz/thesis/etheses_copyright.shtml","All Rights Reserved",,,,,,,,,,,,"Exploring Multicultural Education and Culturally Responsive Practices in an International School context: A case study of one school.",,,"Electronic Thesis or Dissertation",,"Education",,"University of Canterbury",,"Masters",,,"Master of Education",,"2469880",,,"College of Education, Health and Human Development, University of Canterbury",,"tiff79@hotmail.com",,,,,,,,,"Professor Letitia Fickel"

and a modified experience sampling methodology (ESM) obtained retrospective and on-line

Factor 3 (happy), which were then tested against gender, achievement and concept learning. Indepth
qualitative analyses of eight specific target children selected from the wider sample
provided the contextual and within-child variables in relation to the significant emotions
obtained. Specific antecedents were identified for events where children reported some or all of
the significant emotion factors while selecting and/or engaging in learning tasks. Findings include
a significant gender difference with girls reporting positive emotions more frequently than boys,
and that irrespective of individual differences in their achievement measures, when new
information was learned the target children reported feeling any or all of the Factor 2 emotions. This finding at a qualitative level was contradictory to the aggregated finding that there was no
significant relationship between concept learning and Factor 2. This inconsistency was consistent
with previous literature comparing and arguing for both nomothetic and idiopathic methods in

That is, the interests of employers are paramount in the programme, while those of the students are marginalised.

The effects of these predetermined changes in teaching behaviour during the course of the lessons were measured in terms of the level of retention and comprehension of 'target pupils' of the concepts and principles which the lessons were designed to teach. Target pupils were defined, and selected to act as experimental subjects, on the basis of their pre-experimental performance on three tests: a test of prerequisite skills, a test of prior knowledge of the topic, and the IPAT Culture Fair non-verbal intelligence test. Each experimental lesson treatment was reproduced and its effects on retention measured in at least three different classrooms. This thesis describes the results of a coordinated series of nine experiments, the last six of which were designed to measure the effects on student retention of predetermined changes in the frequency of use of specific classes of teaching moves during the oral lesson tactic. The results of these experiments indicated that student retention following the highly effective, standard lesson, treatments was dependent in part upon the number of primary questions asked (relative to the number of informing moves used), the number of reaction moves provided following pupil answers, the level of response control provided by primary questions, the level of response control provided by secondary questions, and the number of secondary response opportunities provided by the teacher (relative to the number of terminal informing moves employed). The experimental procedures employed during the investigations differed from those used during most previous studies of teaching behaviour in a number of ways. The studies made use of a single teacher specially trained to simulate the lesson behaviours typically employed by teachers and to manipulate these behaviours in predetermined ways. They made use of a lesson recording and lesson analysis procedure which enabled the characteristics of each lesson treatment to be described and reported. They made use of procedures which permitted the same lesson content to be reproduced in each experimental lesson treatment and they made use of two 'standard lesson' treatments from which all experimental treatments were derived and against which all lesson treatments could be evaluated. The studies specified in advance the population of target pupils for whom the standard lessons were designed and measured treatment effects in terms of the level of retention achieved by samples from this target population. They also provided for the replication, in several different classrooms, of each experimental lesson treatment and made use of the within replications variance, rather than the within subjects variance, as the error term in evaluating the reliability of obtained treatment effects.",,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/814",,,,,,"en",,,"University of Canterbury.

"1378","10092/806",,,,,"McWilliams, Kyle Grant",,,,,,"2006",,,"A lot about the learning process still remains unknown. The experiments described in this thesis investigated variables that affect instructional efficiency by employing specifically programmed computers to manage and control instructional variables within each experiment for 6- to 7-year old children. A Measurement Procedures Study was undertaken to ascertain when a response should be classified as ""acquired."" It was decided to classify a response as acquired if it could be performed correctly (without prompting) seven days after instruction. A review of the relationship between accuracy level during instruction and the rate of acquisition found that higher accuracy levels during instruction tend to be associated with higher rates of acquisition provided that non-copying prompting procedures are employed. The first experiment investigated the relationship between accuracy level during instruction and rate of acquisition by presenting a non-copying antecedent prompt (model of the correct spelling word) depending on a preselected target accuracy level. As an error-contingent prompt (model of the correct spelling word) was also provided it could not be ascertained whether transfer of stimulus control occurred as a result of the antecedent prompt, or the error-contingent prompt, or both. The second experiment was a repeat of the first experiment with the error-contingent prompt removed. It was found that it was possible to manage, although not completely control, the accuracy level during instruction by presenting a simultaneous non-copying prompt and that higher accuracy levels during instruction were associated with higher rates of acquisition. A review that examined the error-correction research found that a variety of correction procedures were effective. However, none of the 36 experiments which were reviewed controlled the number of response opportunities. Experiment 3 compared the effects on rate of acquisition of presenting an antecedent model or an error-contingent model. The results of Experiment 3 showed that when the number of learning opportunities was controlled there was little difference in effectiveness or efficiency between an antecedent model and an error-contingent model. Experiment 4 compared the effects of presenting an error-contingent model against an error-contingent model and a secondary response opportunity. It was found that an error-contingent model was at least as effective, although it was overall less efficient when response opportunities were controlled. A supplementary analysis was undertaken to review and compare the results obtained across the four experiments. Across experiments each newly acquired spelling response required about five practice responses, on average. It appears this was a critical variable for acquisition. Additionally, each acquired response was acquired over a two-day period. Although rates of acquisition differed between high-achieving children and low-achieving children, there was little difference in the number of practice responses required for acquisition between these two groups. It was observed that most of the 6- to 7-year old participants found error feedback aversive and this appeared to result in reduced attention to models of the correct spelling when these occurred following errors. The results from this series of investigations suggest that an opportunity for the transfer of stimulus control from the prompt (model of the correct spelling) to the practice stimulus (the spoken word) is more critical for acquisition than where the prompt occurs within the trial (that is, the antecedent or consequent position). It was suggested that future research could investigate (a) the variables which are necessary for the transfer of stimulus control, (b) the generality of the observation that children require five practice responses in order to acquire discrete academic responses, and (c) the effects on rates of acquisition and instructional efficiency of varying the distribution in time of practice responses for children who are learning various types of academic skills.",,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/1046",,,,"en",,,,,"University of Canterbury.

To date, information generated from such research includes very little reference to teenagers' perspectives of their behaviours or consideration of sexual behaviour within a broader life context. This thesis aimed to provide a better understanding of teenage sexual intercourse because it involved direct discussions with teenage girls about their unplanned sexual intercourse (USI) experiences. The participants in this study were 22 sexually active teenage girls (aged 14-17 years) referred by health professionals working in a high school health centre in Christchurch, New Zealand. The study involved holding semi-structured interviews with the girls, about their experiences of sexual intercourse and transcribing and analysing the interviews using established qualitative methods such as constant comparative method and typology construction. A developmental framework incorporating Bronfenbrenner's (1979) bioecological model and sociocultural approaches to development was employed to explore the complexity and diversity evident in the girls' narratives. These narratives provided detailed descriptions of the girls' perceptions of their early sexual experiences, including first sexual intercourse (FSI), subsequent sexual intercourse (SSI) and their most recent unplanned sexual intercourse (MRUSI). A protective discourse and erotic discourse featured prevalently in the girls' talk. Of particular importance were: the girls' diverse interpretations of these discourses; the range of factors that motivated sexual intercourse; the girls' perceptions of parents' views of teenage sexual intercourse; and the girls' analysis of their sexuality education. While the content of the girls' interpretations supported findings of previous research in the area, they also extended our knowledge by providing alternative ways of looking at factors commonly associated with teenage sexual intercourse. Implications of these findings include the need for researchers and people working with teenagers to broaden their views of adolescent sexual activity and to incorporate alternative perspectives on teenage sexual intercourse. Future research in the area should foster strategies that ensure that diversity in adolescent sexual experience and understanding is solicited, acknowledged, and promoted.",,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/1792",,,,"en",,,,,"University of Canterbury.

"2663","10092/806",,,,,"Vince, Anita Jane",,,,,,"2007",,,"This case study was based on a programme that followed the Nurture Group concept in a Secondary School in New Zealand. The Success at School (SAS) programme was based within the school complex and consisted of a home classroom where students were provided with both an academic and social/ life skills programme. The nine selected students were all failing academically and socially within the Year 9 cohort. Academically, all students made some small gains in their literacy and numeracy skills and also on task behaviour. Socially, small gains were made by most students in their positive interactions with others and in decreasing their absences, suspensions, referrals from class and lateness to school. Eight of the nine students indicated an attachment/ trust relationship with their teacher and/ or teacher aide. However it is not clear if the small gains that were made by most of the students can be directly attributed to the Nurture Group concept. The small group size, 1:1 teaching, individualised learning programmes and the introduction of a social skills programme may also have contributed to the small academic and social gains the students made.

The main findings relate to chemical misconceptions, concept development, pupils' views of
their learning environment, problem-solving ability and assessment of chemistry at year 13 level.
Moreover, it shows how each is related to the current state of chemistry teaching, learning and
assessment in the New Zealand curriculum. Relationships between pupils' ideas of their own
learning, their ability to understand important chemical concepts and to problem-solve, are
described. These relationships give an indication of the strengths and weaknesses inherent in
teaching and assessing chemistry, as well as identifying barriers to understanding that need to
be addressed. Concept development is shown to be hindered by misconceptions, even though
these alternative conceptions have been well documented here and overseas. Serious
misconceptions are described regarding physical/chemical change, aspects of the kinetic theory
of gases, chemical reactions and the mole concept. An intervention study of concept
development using a discovery constructivist method is described that indicates this type of
approach has real value for some aspects of chemistry. The approach may lend itself to student
investigations in classification of matter, chemical analysis, equilibrium reactions, polarity of
molecules and yield of an organic product. The ability of students to problem-solve and apply
their knowledge and skills to new situations is strongly correlated with factors such as attitude
to experimental work. There are, however, important skills detailed in the curriculum that are
not covered by the current University Bursaries examination. These centre on problem-solving
and include focusing, planning, information gathering, experimenting and reporting. There are
aspects of some classroom environments, such as perceptions students have of the best way to
learn and teacher controlled lessons, that encourage a passive role in learning (particularly for
female students).",,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/2828",,,,"en",,,,,"University of Canterbury.

"4103","10092/806",,,"Brown, Douglas William Ferguson",,,,,,,,"1962",,,"Maori scholastic under-achievement is a large and very complex problem of increasing national significance. This study was an attempt to discover the factors determining this scholastic under-achievement, and to make some contribution towards that part of ameliorative action which is the concern of classroom teachers. Necessarily it had been an exploratory study. Many issues which in their own right have merited detailed investigation were given scant attention because of the over-riding priority accorded the need for practical solutions at the classroom level. The increasing numbers of Maoris being educated beside Europeans restricts the range of acceptable solutions, for obviously, and if alone for practical reasons, the classroom teacher cannot differentiate between Maori and European in the methods he uses. The need then is for methodology to be modified so that the principles and practices of the classroom are adequate for the needs of Maori and European alike. In fact, it was the thesis of this study that Maori scholastic under-achievement is but a crystallization of a general intellectual under-achievement in New Zealand schools. The difficulties Maori have in achieving scholastically actually define the areas of weakness in methodology. Throughout the study, then, a major concern was to relate Maori difficulties to educational theory and practice the better to define ameliorative theory and practice the better to define ameliorative action. A substantial portion of the study was, therefore, theoretical; its purpose being to assist the reformulation of that part of theory and practice shown to be inadequate by the factors determining Maori difficulties in the classroom. The last part of this study presents an outline of principles and practices considered to be needed in methodology if both the Maori and European are to achieve at higher levels.",,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/3645",,,,"en",,,,,"University of Canterbury.

"6350","10092/806",,,,,"Alton-Lee, A. G.",,,,,,"1984",,,"A methodology was developed to investigate the question: 'What facilitates pupil learning in classrooms?' The question was interpreted to constrain the methodology in requiring: a naturalistic orientation, a focus on the range of variables influencing pupil experience of content, and a non-selective observation procedure. These constraints led to a study of the experience of three case study pupils during their in-class opportunity to interact with the content of an integrated unit.
 A multi-method approach was adopted in order to obtain as much information as possible about pupil experience of content. Three observers alternated in continuously observing and recording the behaviours of the three pupils. Audio-recordings were made of public lessons and audible pupil interactions were noted. Copies of all teacher resources and pupil work were taken. Teacher and observer perceptions were noted.
 The pupils were tested before the seven week unit, immediately afterwards, and again one year later. After the long-term post test, interviews were conducted to obtain: information about the validity of the tests, more information about pupil experience of tested content, and pupil perceptions of their learning.
 The test was sub-divided into three parallel sets of items. For each of these items, files were constructed for the case study pupils which included descriptions of their total in-class opportunity to interact with this content. The teacher and researcher engaged in a prediction procedure using pretest responses and records of pupil opportunity to interact with content. This was done to identify extant insight into pupil learning and to reveal researcher bias which might unduly restrict the data analyses. This procedure showed that both teacher and researcher were able to successfully predict over 70 % of pupil outcomes from the observational record. Factors which inhibited higher prediction success rates for both teacher and researcher were failure to: recognize the primacy of concrete experience as a pre-requisite for long-term learning, identify the presence, persistence, and retro-active effects of pupil misconceptions, account for the strength of the relationship between time and learning, and take into account out-of-class learning opportunities on in-class achievement.
 The item files were classified according to the five possible outcomes: already known, learned and remembered, learned and forgotten, not learned, and mislearned. The average time spent by pupils on content which was not learned was less than one fifth of the time spent on content learned and remembered. The number of occasions upon which the opportunity to interact with content occurred was also shown to be related to pupil learning with content learned and remembered occurring over more than six school days.
 An analysis of pupil behaviour was carried out in relation to the five learning outcomes. Mean frequencies and rates per hour were calculated in order to show which behaviours were related to learning because they took up the time spent, which behaviours were related to learning over and above the time spent, which behaviours inhibited learning, and which behaviours were unrelated to pupil learning. The consistency of these relationships across the three data sets was also calculated. Opportunity to interact with content both in teacher-directed lessons and in self-directed or peer-directed task contexts was found to be related to learning. Opportunity to attend to a concrete demonstration of new concepts, and opportunity to attend to teacher-pupil discussion were found to be systematically related to pupil long-term learning. Picture attending opportunity and involvement in mime were found to be related to short-term learning. Rubbing out during individual tasks was found to be consistently related to pupil learning. Peer interaction was found to relate, to pupil learning both positively and negatively depending upon task contexts and the rate and type of communication. There were differences between the case study pupils in their overt involvement with content, their perceptions of task requirements, and their ability to obtain useful information from T.
 An analysis of exceptions to the overall pattern of findings revealed that chart attending opportunity and diagram drawing behaviour occurred at very high rates for content which was learned in spite of less time spent. Pupil concrete experience and pupil misconceptions were found to be confounding variables in relation to the time spent. 
 The case study pupils were found to have responded in a characteristic manner to new content with high rates of fiddling, talking to self, and peer interaction. These behaviours are postulated to indicate the occurrence of cognitive conflict and cognitive restructuring in covert pupil processing.
 The study findings were used to generate a grounded nascent theory of the learning of the case study pupils. In this theory pupil learning is viewed as the effect of interaction between three major variable clusters: facilitative opportunity to learn, pupil behaviour, and pupil resource access. Given the interaction of the three variable clusters the nature of pupil learning is explained as a three stage process which occurs over time. The first and briefest stage (awareness and disequilibrium) occurs when a pupil actively engages with new content. The more relevant prior knowledge and experience the pupil has, the more likely the engagement in this initial stage of the learning process. The second
 stage (cognitive restructuring, resolution, and integration) occurs as the child restructures existing schema, and attempts to forge links between existing knowledge and new content. The final stage (schema development and anchoring) involves the accretion of enough appropriate links to make
 the new information part of the pupil's general knowledge of the world.
 It is claimed that the findings of this study have important implications for research but they are neither generalizable to different contexts, nor prescriptive for practitioners.",,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/5913",,,,"en",,,,,"University of Canterbury.

The research design is an emergent one. In a broader sense it is a case study that explores English language teaching within a specific country’s context and there are multiple embedded cases within the large case. The participants are students, teachers, teacher trainers, parents, principals and other professionals. Data came from the stories my participants told me about their experiences, my observations, classroom artefacts, document analysis and reports from large scale projects.

Previous research in English language teaching in Bangladesh has focused on specific practices mainly exploring problems associated with English language teaching. In contrast to previous research, this study while acknowledging the value of more specifically targeted investigations, provides a composite picture of English language teaching in Bangladesh.

The initial study in the thesis utilised a survey to investigate teachers’ beliefs about effective teaching quality, reports of their practice, and the barriers encountered. Analysis of the survey indicated a number of areas where there were contradictions between respondents’ claimed understanding and their reported practices. These indicated areas for further investigation. The analysis revealed five influential factors that shapes English language teaching in Bangladesh.

The first factor was the operation of the examination system and the ways it dominates education. I report teachers’, students’ and parents’ attitudes to examinations. These affirmed the power of the examination system in directing teaching practices and also revealed the extent to which the examination system was upheld by expectations of families and wider communities.

The next is the importance of communicative uses of English for business, education, social status and entry into other countries. I report participants’ stories of why English is important to them and discuss the difficulties encountered in developing a communicative approach to English teaching.

The third factor is the various ways in which English teachers are trained and the institutions and projects that provide the training. A number of gaps and problems are identified. Inadequate provision of pre- service and in-service training opportunities for teachers is one of the main barriers to develope teachers professionally.

This study also reports the disparity that exists in terms of access, available resources and opportunities in urban, rural and slum areas. Of all, slum inhabitants are the most deprived. Rural areas lag behind in terms of infrastructural facilities, available resources and quality teachers. This divide is also one of wealth and so the limited educational opportunities of students in urban slums are also examined.

The fifth issue is the impact of international influences on English language teaching in Bangladesh. Legacies of colonialism and pressures of neo-colonialism are explored. Also examined is the impact of English as a global lingua franca and the role and the influence of international providers of loans and aid.

This study identified that English language teaching in Bangladesh takes place in a context that is complex and multifaceted. The overarching implication of the findings is that policy shifts and plans for implementation need to consider these complexities.

This research acknowledges the value of western knowledge as an additional critical lens but advocates a Bangladesh epistemological approach that builds on the grounded realities of the forces that shape life and schooling in Bangladesh rather than the replication of foreign models.",,,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/14381",,,"en","English",,,,"University of Canterbury",,,,,,,"http://library.canterbury.ac.nz/thesis/etheses_copyright.shtml","All Rights Reserved",,,,,,,,,,,,"Charting the river: a case study of English language teaching in Bangladesh",,,"Electronic Thesis or Dissertation",,"Education",,"University of Canterbury",,"Doctoral",,,"Doctor of Philosophy",,"2529934",,,"College of Education, Health and Human Development, University of Canterbury",,"alrahat2003@yahoo.com",,,,,,,,,"Professor Janinka Greenwood"
"15719","10092/806",,,"Ma, Shaowei",,,,,,,,"2016",,,"The underlying rationale behind alphabetic orthographies is that graphemes roughly correspond to phonemes. However, in the Chinese writing system, the basic unit is a character that usually represents one syllable and corresponds to one morpheme. Given that phonological awareness plays a central role in reading acquisition for alphabets that follow regular grapheme-phoneme correspondence rules, it seems likely that morphological awareness should be more important for learning to read scripts in which the mappings between orthography and meaning are often systematic. Such fundamental differences in the orthographies may have significant implications for the way written words are recognized and, hence, the way reading is acquired. In mainland China, children learn Chinese characters through being taught the more alphabetic script of Pinyin. It is, therefore, likely that the Pinyin system, as well as the Chinese characters system, will influence reading development. Therefore, a complex relationship between reading, phonological and morphological processing may be predicted, with the influence of the latter two on the former varying with development – as Pinyin becomes less important for decoding, phonological influences may be superseded by morphological.
The present research investigated the early development of Chinese reading skills to assess potential changes in phonological and morphological influences. Measures of reading Pinyin and Chinese characters were given to children in primary-level school grades in Mainland China. Over the course of the study, grades 1 to 5 were assessed with about 50 children in each grade tested. Measures of word and non-word reading, as well as reading comprehension were used. In addition, a range of phonological and morphological tasks were developed, and these were contrasted with Chinese vocabulary and rapid naming, to measure the potential impact of these language skills on Chinese reading. Cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses were conducted to assess such impacts.
Both cross-sectional and longitudinal data indicated a change in relationships across grades such that early phonological predictors of Chinese character and text reading were replaced by morphological processing skills and measures of rapid naming. The results argue that phonological awareness plays an important role in reading acquisition at the beginning of acquisition for these Mainland Chinese students, whereas morphological processing is more important for intermediate and upper graders in later stages of reading development. These findings are discussed in relation to current general models of reading and specific influences of orthography, as well as the context of literacy learning within Mainland China.",,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/12871",,,,"en","English",,,,"University of Canterbury",,,,,,,"http://library.canterbury.ac.nz/thesis/etheses_copyright.shtml","All Rights Reserved",,,,,,,,,,,,"Comparisons of the influence of phonological and morphological processing on Chinese reading developmen t: a cross-sectional and longitudinal study","Theses / Dissertations",,,,,"Education","University of Canterbury",,"Doctoral",,,"Doctor of Philosophy",,,,,"College of Education, Health and Human Development, University of Canterbury",,"michemasmile@gmail.com",,,,,,,,,"John Everatt"

face on-going challenges and potential ‘crisis’. For too long, Pasifika students have
been trapped in a ‘prison-like’ environment of underachievement. The ‘crisis’ is that
the status does not appear to have changed significantly since the 1960s and 70s,
regardless of the endeavours by the New Zealand government and Ministry of
Education to Pasifika education. Decade after decade, the educational status of
Pasifika students overall has continued to maintain its position; one that places them
at the very bottom in comparison to non-Pasifika students. Many teenagers continue
to leave school with no qualifications, resulting in unemployment or poorly paid jobs.
Consequently, more and more Pasifika families live in poverty in this country. The
on-going unanswered question is: Are Pasifika students failing the system or, is the
New Zealand Education system failing Pasifika students? When are ‘we’ as a
‘community of learners’ going to get this right?

This thesis is presented in a form of a voyage (folauga) to contextualize the true
essence, depth and significance of the topic of this study in relation to the challenges
and tests presented by a long hard fought voyage. Each chapter is referred to as
Folauga. Four school principals, recognised as effective leaders who support
Pasifika students, shared their leadership experiences and practices in a Talanoa
setting. Interpretation and analysis of the Talanoa revealed seven major supports
that effective school leaders need to transform their schools from a failing context to
a successful, for Pasifika students. This research found that there was a significant
need for effective leadership by principals to navigate educational changes that
genuinely make a difference to unlock doors of opportunities in every school to raise
achievement and wellbeing for all Pasifika learners. Furthermore, the analysis and
interpretation based on the perspectives and data gathered through Talanoa with the
Mau ki te Ako Pasifika Education Advisory Group (Pasifika community leaders)
validated these key supports that the principals identified. The aim of the study was
to address this issue through effective professional development for school leaders
so they may navigate robust, vigorous and well-thought through changes and
supports in schools to raise the engagement and achievement of Pasifika learners.
Lifting Pasifika achievement is a great challenge for all but nothing is impossible.

"13706","10092/806",,,,"Pilgrim, Marcia",,,,,,,"2015",,,"The Resource Teacher Learning and Behaviour (RTLB) service was formed in
Aotearoa New Zealand as a key part of national educational policy to create a worldclass
inclusive education system. In order to provide an up-to-date training
programme for RTLB the New Zealand government in 2010 contracted two
universities to develop a competency-based, blended learning programme that could
be accessed by teachers throughout the country.
The relevant literature on competency-based approaches in education, adult
learning and e-learning highlight the requirement for carefully selecting programme
competencies, taking account of the needs of adult learners, as well as realizing the
potential of the e-learning environment to provide increased opportunities for
meaningful learning through engagement in communities of practice. The present
research was conducted to look for evidence that the new programme was addressing
these key issues that are highlighted in the literature.
Through a mixed-method study, this thesis investigates the perceptions of the
first cohort of graduates of the training programme developed for RTLB. The research
design involved an online questionnaire survey completed by over half of the
graduates, followed by six focus group interviews conducted with a selection of
participants. The study specifically examined the importance of the 51 programme
competencies to the work of participants and how well enabled participants
considered they had been to develop these competencies. Factors that enabled
participants to develop competencies in the context of the programme were
investigated, as well as those that acted as barriers to competency enablement.
Results indicated that all of the programme competencies were perceived by
participants to be of high importance to their work in the field of learning and
behaviour difficulties and that they were well enabled to develop these competencies.
Participants considered that a range of factors acted as barriers to or enablers of
competency development. These focused on five overarching themes related to:
course content, relevance, clarity and structure; supports; managing time and
pressure; pre-requisite knowledge, skills, and experience; and, access to technology.
Based on these findings, implications for practice relevant to programme
coordinators, RTLB managers, school principals, policy makers and for Māori, are
discussed. Limitations of the research study are identified and recommendations for
future research are made.",,,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/11807",,,"en","English",,,,"University of Canterbury",,,,,,,"http://library.canterbury.ac.nz/thesis/etheses_copyright.shtml","All Rights Reserved",,,,,,,,,,,,"Competencies in the Training of Resource Teachers Learning and Behaviour: An evaluation","Theses / Dissertations",,,,,"Education","University of Canterbury",,"Doctoral",,,"Doctor of Philosophy",,"2139100",,,"College of Education, Health and Human Development, University of Canterbury",,"marciarosepilgrim@gmail.com",,,,,,,,,"Professor John Everatt"
"13734","10092/806",,,,"Alam, Safayet",,,,,,,"2016",,,"A Bangla saying suggests that when people work together they enjoy the wisdom of engagement irrespective of the extent of accomplishment and final outcomes. This research reports and illustrates the development of a learning community of teachers in a rural Bangladeshi secondary school. I argue that a participatory action research process, in a many different ways, not only provides opportunity to explore existing conditions of teaching practice, but also offer explorative tools to collaboratively examine and reflect on the practices in order to strategically change them for better students’ educational outcomes.
The study is based on a Bangladeshi remote rural secondary school. It considers the wider context of current social and educational development within Bangladesh. The project works within the tension between external influences and the real needs of teachers, students and local community.
In terms of educational outcomes, the rural schools are far behind than the urban schools. However existing professional development programmes and in-service teacher training are centrally developed and top-down and do not fully align with the rural teacher’s needs. Thus there is a need for alternative processes that might better meet the educational needs of a rural community. The process of how one such school learning community developed and worked is important because it creates opportunity to make incremental and varying shifts in teacher’s understanding and actions. Moreover, there are no similar published accounts of such development in Bangladesh and this can therefore serve as an illustrative model of possibilities as well as the challenges and tensions inherent in such an undertaking..
The investigative focus of this project was based on two goals. The central goal was focused on the evolution of the teachers’ learning community and the changing understandings they developed of their role and their practice. The second goal was to reflect on my own evolving understanding of my role as facilitator and participant in the project and on what was happening through the project.
Therefore, this research examines and reports how the teachers and I undertook different activities that allowed us to explore changes to existing teaching practices. It utilises the teachers’ direct dialogues that I weave into a narrative of the process to show how we collectively and individually developed commitment and willingness to adapt and relate the emergent understandings with the students’ varying educational needs.
The study engaged the head teacher, teachers, and students in the research process and to enable them to see themselves as active agents in their changing conditions. Initially the project began as my initiative and then it was enabled to progress through two key factors. First the head teacher of the school envisioned the development of a teachers’ learning community as means to bring useful change in the school as well as in the community. And second the teachers showed commitment to the project and determined its overall direction through their active engagement.
The conceptual framework of this study draws on literature from three intersecting fields: research from Bangladesh, indigenous approaches to knowledge and the influence of colonisations, and notions of action research, reflective practice, learning communities and situated learning. It also describes the experiential context of the community and school.
The most significant observable outcome of the project was the sustenance of the teachers’ commitment in examining their practice for more than six months, despite having an already full workload, and despite the challenges, and occasional pain it created for them, emotionally and conceptually. This commitment to the research process gave rise to an attitude to and a practice of sharing and exchanging. Beneath these observable outcomes were less overtly visible shifts, including the gradual surrender of aspects of a role they had thought they had to act out, that of being the authority and expert in their classrooms, and beginning to explore other possibilities. I gained several understandings from the project. First I understand that if we look at the possibilities within our reach we can make some difference in rural schooling. My second key understanding is that the goal of emancipation in an educational setting can be a shift in thinking and part of an on-going process of reflection and so translate into informed action.
The study illustrates how teaching practice in a rural school can be improved for better educational outcomes for students. The outcomes and the shifts of teachers’ understandings provide exemplars for the forms of professional development programmes we need to create, for their content, and for the skills needed in facilitating them.
I conducted my research in a situated Bangladeshi rural school. I acknowledge that the outcomes are inspiring but limited to a specific context. However, the processes and the outcomes that were involved in my project can be adapted in other rural schools inside and outside of Bangladesh to generate further knowledge about learning communities, praxis and participatory action research process, and thus to improve our national capacity to educate our children.",,,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/11856",,,"en","English",,,,"University of Canterbury",,,,,,,"http://library.canterbury.ac.nz/thesis/etheses_copyright.shtml","All Rights Reserved",,,,,,,,,,,,"Teachers, collaboration, praxis: A case study of a participatory action research project in a rural school of Bangladesh","Theses / Dissertations",,,,,"Education","University of Canterbury",,"Doctoral",,,"Doctor of Philosophy",,"2267327",,,"College of Education, Health and Human Development, University of Canterbury",,"safayet2002@yahoo.com",,,,,,,,,"Professor Janinka Greenwood"

current context of Afghanistan. It examines their stories and reflects on their thoughts
and perspectives about education in order to foreground their concerns regarding the
current status and issues of Afghan education. The stories of the activists shed light on
the relation of power and education since the rise of the pro-communist regime in the
1970s to the present time.
As a social constructivist concerned about the multiple ways that people make meaning
of the world my epistemological position contributed to my choice of narrative inquiry as
my methodological approach and as a means of communication with my participants and
collection of participants’ stories of activism. Narrative inquiry provided my participants
an opportunity to share their stories and express their thoughts and perspectives with me.
The findings of this thesis indicate that the roots of the problems with Afghan education
are historic and that the socio-political and religious attitudes that restrict education are
deeply and widely embedded in the religious and political ideologies that rule the
country, peoples’ traditional beliefs, and the constant foreign interventions in
Afghanistan affairs. Findings also illustrate that Afghan schools are not neutral
institutions and invariably support the status quo. While the majority of the population
including most of the teachers do not question the status quo, the voices of the
educational activists presented in this thesis provide invaluable insights into why they
challenge the status quo, why their voices matter, and how they signal hope.
This study not only brings forth the voices of the Afghan educational activists but also
contributes towards the understanding of effective ways of empowering Afghan schools
to have an impact over the larger community to create a stable Afghanistan that would
enjoy peace, social justice, rule of law, humanity, and democracy.",,,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/11803",,,"en","English",,,,"University of Canterbury",,,,,,,"http://library.canterbury.ac.nz/thesis/etheses_copyright.shtml","All Rights Reserved",,,,,,,,,,,,"In the pursuit of light: voices of educational activists in Afghanistan","Theses / Dissertations",,,,,"Education","University of Canterbury",,"Doctoral",,,"Doctor of Philosophy",,"2138893",,,"College of Education, Health and Human Development, University of Canterbury",,"tariq.habibyar@gmail.com",,,,,,,,,"Professor Letitia Fickel"

Despite overall declines, particularly young adults and Maori (the indigenous population of New Zealand) continue to have high rates of smoking. Research suggests that Internet- and Mobile phone-based interventions are effective to achieve cessation of smoking however the effects are short-term. The purpose of this Meta-Analysis was to pool together evidence regarding the effectiveness of Internet-and Mobile phone-based interventions to achieve longer-term cessation of smoking among adolescent and adult smokers. The analysis was based on the assessment and pooling of Randomized Controlled Trials and reported outcomes at six months or longer. This analysis was based on English Language articles published in the previous ten years (2004-2014) whose comparison group received either any other intervention or an intervention inclusive of but not limited to Internet-and Mobile phone-based interventions delivered at a lower frequency. Both a Fixed-Effects and a Random-Effects Meta-Analysis between all studies were conducted to assess the length of abstinence. Moreover the individual studies were grouped using an outcome theme and five subgroup analyses were conducted.
Findings from both, the Fixed-Effects and Random-Effects Meta-Analysis suggest great heterogeneity among the studies. Overall findings suggest that Internet-and Mobile phone-based interventions used in smoking cessation are effective in achieving longer-term cessation of smoking (pooled OR= 1.13, 95% CI: 1.07, 1.20). Findings from the subgroup analyses suggest that both Internet-and Mobile phone-based interventions combined with an additional intervention inclusive of Nicotine Replacement Therapy are most effective in achieving longer-term cessation of smoking among adolescent and adult smokers. These findings suggest that Internet-and Mobile phone-based interventions alone are not sufficient to achieve longer-term smoking cessation among chronic smokers and that additional interventions are needed to achieve longer-term smoking cessation.",,,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/11841",,,"en","English",,,,"University of Canterbury",,,,,,,"http://library.canterbury.ac.nz/thesis/etheses_copyright.shtml","All Rights Reserved",,,,,,,,,,,,"Effectiveness of Internet-based and Mobile phone-based interventions to achieve smoking cessation for adolescent and adult smokers: a meta-analysis","Theses / Dissertations",,,,,"Health Sciences","University of Canterbury",,"Masters",,,"Master of Health Sciences",,"2266656",,,"College of Education, Health and Human Development, University of Canterbury",,"bee.leech031O@gmail.com",,,,,,,,,"Dr. Arindam Basu"
"13721","10092/806",,,,"Hooper, Lee Ian-Paul",,,,,,,"2015",,,"Teachers play an important role in facilitating learning. The way they establish relationships with students is crucial to ensure that the classroom environment supports both academic and personal growth in students (Evans & Harvey, 2012). In recognising the importance of relationships inside of the classroom and their effects on student behaviour, the purpose of this study took two pathways.
First, this study involved an exploration of how a person-centred approach could help facilitate positive relationships within an educational context. An approach called Non-violent communication (NVC) was chosen because of its potential to enhance the teachers’ empathy, interpersonal communication skills, as well as foster less judgemental perceptions and reactions to challenging student behaviours (Rosenberg, 2003a).
Second, a Quality Learning Circle (QLC) model was used as a method to practise and share the teachers’ experiences of learning NVC together in a collegial and experiential way. A collaborative approach was chosen to counter teachers working alone in the hope that sharing responsibility in direction and decision making would encourage empowerment among the teachers. Therefore, in addition to critically analysing NVC, this study also examined the impact of a QLC on teachers’ professional learning. It is a study which has a content focus (i.e., learning about the potential of NVC) and at the same time, a process focus (i.e., exploring the potential of a small group approach to teachers’ professional learning to share and gain insight into their practice).
The study involved four secondary school teachers from two New Zealand urban schools. These teachers attended seven QLC meetings throughout one school term, and completed entry- as well as exit interviews to determine the impact and potential of both the content (NVC) and process (QLC) of the study. In addition, fieldnotes were taken to help document the teachers’ journeys throughout the QLC. An interpretive paradigm, which centred on thematic analysis, was used as a means to analyse and interpret the findings in order to shed light on how NVC contributed to positive teacher-student relationships, as well as how the QLC afforded the teachers with a novel way to engage in professional learning.
The teachers reported that learning NVC helped them to avoid using judgements and increased their emotional awareness inside of the classroom. In particular, they used processes within NVC to help regulate their emotions when they encountered difficult situations, as well as purposely engaged in more open dialogues with their students. Furthermore, they also used NVC as a tool to critically reflect on their own teaching beliefs and how those beliefs impacted on the interactions they had with their students. The teachers also confirmed that the collaborative, experiential, and supportive aspects of the QLC provided an environment where they could safely practise a new approach. Through coming together in this way the teachers created a space where they could openly discuss ideas, share experiences, and co-create solutions to common contextual problems.
The implications of this study are twofold: First, it highlights how empathy-based programmes have the potential to increase teachers’ emotional self-regulation skills and perspective taking abilities. Second, it demonstrates the benefits of structuring teachers’ professional learning in a way that encourages active participation, ongoing learning, and the creation of a collaborative culture. As teachers are increasingly encountering stress and isolation within their profession, both elements of this research are pertinent to their wellbeing, as well as the wellbeing of the students they teach.",,,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/11839",,,"en","English",,,,"University of Canterbury",,,,,,,"http://library.canterbury.ac.nz/thesis/etheses_copyright.shtml","All Rights Reserved",,,,,,,,,,,,"An exploratory study: non-violent communication strategies for secondary teachers using a Quality Learning Circle approach","Theses / Dissertations",,,,,"Education","University of Canterbury",,"Masters",,,"Master of Education",,"2266650",,,"College of Education, Health and Human Development, University of Canterbury",,"lee.hooper@pg.canterbury.ac.nz",,,,,,,,,"Associate Professor Susan Lovett"

been perceived as an area of learning combining knowledge and innovation.
This research sought to obtain deeper insight into technology education implementation in
New Zealand and Saudi Arabia in order to explore how this subject is implemented in both
contexts that leads to identification of the similarities and the differences between them.
The findings of this research could help to promote and enhance teaching science and
technology in the Saudi primary education. A qualitative approach was used as a main
approach supported by a qualitative approach in the Saudi context to obtain rich data on
the status quo of technology education in the two countries. Data were obtained from
documents analysis, interviews with technology teachers and technology experts,
observations of practice, and questionnaires.
The findings indicate that technology education has become one of the key subjects in
developed countries. This has pushed New Zealand to make a good progress in
implementing technology education in its curriculum by establishing a suitable strategy to
include this subject in the curriculum. In Saudi Arabia, technology education has not been
clearly defined and it has been implicitly integrated with science subjects. Therefore, there
were significant differences in implementing the two subjects in both contexts particularly

A case study approach within a qualitative research paradigm is taken, including individual interviews with staff, children and parents, a focus group interview with teachers, observations, artefact analysis and reflective notes. The analysis takes the form of a grounded theory approach, beginning with the identification of enacted centre norms, which were found to be the linchpin of the centre’s organisational culture.
My study uses two frameworks for analysis to explore the organisational culture of the case study centre in terms of influences for children’s experiences. The first is Schein’s (2010) model of organisational culture, which identifies three progressively deeper levels from visible actions and artefacts, through espoused core values, to deeply held assumptions and beliefs revealed by norms that were enacted but unacknowledged. The second is Foucault’s conception of power, particularly disciplinary power and biopower, and his notion that specific patterns of social norms serve to integrate people into social entities.
Findings from Schein’s lens showed how espoused values contributed to enacted norms, which directly influenced children’s experiences in the case study centre. The espoused value of child choice was traced as a specific example, for its influence for children’s experiences. This value arose not from the founder of the organisation, as Schein suggests, but from the teaching team, with the designated centre leader contributing to its endurance through ensuring a strong level of fit with new members of the teaching team, and to a lesser extent with incoming parents.
Analysis from Foucault’s lens revealed that while younger children were coming to grips with the content and context of centre norms, the older children were able to predict that adults would act according to centre norms, and to use that knowledge to meet their own desires of the moment. Surveillance as a commonly employed technique of disciplinary power, intersected with a core centre value of child safety, leading to a child perceiving that she was unsafe unless being watched by an adult. This is an example of biopower inserting itself into the psyche of the child.
Thus, organisational culture becomes a curriculum issue, because it is shaping children’s experiences in early childhood education as children make their own sense of norms and way things get done. To continue to ignore it is to close our eyes to critical aspects of what children are learning in our early childhood settings.",,,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/11866",,,"en","English",,,,"University of Canterbury",,,,,,,"http://library.canterbury.ac.nz/thesis/etheses_copyright.shtml","All Rights Reserved",,,,,,,,,,,,"“Can you look after us?”: the influence of organisational culture for children's experiences in an early childhood centre","Theses / Dissertations",,,,,"Education","University of Canterbury",,"Doctoral",,,"Doctor of Philosophy",,"2267446",,,"College of Education, Health and Human Development, University of Canterbury",,"sandyradford@clear.net.nz",,,,,,,,,"Associate Professor Susan Lovett"

Early childhood is regarded as the critical period for the formation of positive environmental attitudes where social action towards change can take place.  

This thesis provides insights into the complex nature of young children’s perspectives on their role as guardians of the Earth, or kaitiakitanga, and early childhood education for sustainability. This case study followed a qualitative research methodology. The participants of this research were three and four year old children, attending a kindergarten. The flexible evolving interpretive approach allowed for a range of ways to participate. 

The main source of data was rich narrative observations and recordings of the children’s discussions, actions, work, learning stories and every day play episodes in the children’s natural setting. Analysis of the data generated themes that highlighted the children’s views and understandings of their role as guardians of the Earth. 

An ecosystem, as a metaphor and conceptual tool, is used to draw attention to the layers and complexities of the children’s perspectives and actions. Characteristics of a complex biotic community of unity, relationships, interactions and all the parts and pieces needed to keep an ecosystem healthy were brought to the fore. 
 
 The findings emphasise the value and importance children place on their role as guardians of the Earth. Functioning as a part of a team, taking action, and caring for their environment mattered greatly to them. The children’s views were supported by the kindergarten programme and the adults around them. The research findings draw attention to implications for early childhood education for sustainability programme development and teacher practices. A case is put forward for initial and ongoing teacher education across all educational sectors, as well as creating future pathways where children are supported in their role as guardians (kaitiakitanga).",,,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/11634",,,"en",,,,,"University of Canterbury.

"13029","10092/806",,,,"Scott, Amy",,,,,,,"2015",,,"The language and literacy development of young children starts in the home, and is
strongly influenced by the experiences and beliefs they are exposed to by their parents.
Teenage mothers are reported to have an increased risk of low levels of educational
attainment, with preliminary data suggesting literacy development is also impeded. Further,
their potentially negative experiences with reading may influence their beliefs and
perceptions of the activity. Children of teenage mothers are at greater risk of delayed
language and literacy development, and their mothers may be less able to provide the
enriched experiences required to facilitate optimal development. Therefore, interventions to
support both the mother’s own literacy beliefs and skills, and the literacy environment in
which they raise their children are a potentially useful way of optimising the developmental
opportunities available. Despite the identified intergenerational nature of literacy learning,
interventions targeting the literacy skills of teenage mothers and their children, particularly in
the New Zealand context, are sparse. The experiments in this thesis addressed the need to
better understand the language and literacy development of New Zealand teenage mothers
and their children, and determine the effectiveness of interventions to target these important
areas.
The first study explored the home literacy environments provided by 41 New Zealand
teenage mothers. This experiment utilised an online survey to gather qualitative and
quantitative data on four key aspects of the home literacy environment. The findings suggest
that teenage mothers recognise the importance of engaging children in shared reading
interactions, but they lack knowledge on other aspects of children’s early literacy experience.
For example, the role their own reading behaviours may contribute, the importance of providing a home environment enriched with literacy resources, and developmentally
appropriate behaviours demonstrated by young children during shared reading.

significant improvement was detected in any area.
The fourth study aimed to describe the language and development of 36 children of
teenage mothers (M = 17 months). A range of standardised and parent-report assessment
measures were used. Results varied considerably within the group on all measures. On
clinician measures of language development, younger children performed more poorly than
older children. Discrepancies were also observed between parent- and clinician-report
measures. Parent measures primarily indicated children were performing within or at above
average range in language and development. Conversely, clinician-report measures
highlighted concerns with regards to children’s language development. In consideration of
the risk profiles associated with teenage motherhood, the results suggested that these children
may benefit from enriched language and literacy opportunities through quality shared reading
interactions with their mothers.
Given the home literacy environment was reported as lacking in enriched
opportunities for literacy development, and children’s language development was identified
as at-risk, the fifth study implemented a parent-targeted intervention to enrich the shared
reading interactions experienced by 27 children of teenage mothers (M = 19;6). Using a pretest/
post-test research design mothers completed a seven week intervention based in the
classroom, targeting a range of emergent literacy skills that they could utilise when reading
with their children. A comparison cohort (n = 10; M = 18;3) was utilised to establish if
assessed behaviours were commensurate with a similar population of teenage mothers.
Assessments tracked changes in the type and frequency of mothers’ reading behaviours
demonstrated during videoed shared reading interactions with their young children, as well as
changes to aspects of the home literacy environment. A blinded, independent coder
completed the data analysis. Results indicated significantly greater frequency of vocabulary, questioning and book/print features-focused reading behaviours from pre-test to post-test. No
changes were observed in reading behaviours relating to letter/sound features.
The sixth study provided an in-depth analysis of the quality and quantity of language
used by mothers and children during the shared reading interactions collected in study five.
Using a pre-test/post-test research design, language quality and quantity was measured during
the shared reading interactions of 14 mother/child dyads (M = 19;9). Analysis examined
MLU-m and total number of words and utterances used by mother and child, mother’s use of
rare/sophisticated words, and children’s use of word classes. Discourse-level analysis was
also completed, which examined five different types of conversational acts. Results
demonstrated significant and meaningful changes in both language quality and quantity
following the emergent literacy intervention. Changes at the discourse level were also
observed.
This thesis revealed that the language and literacy profiles of teenage mothers and
their children are heterogeneous in nature, and may reflect a wide range of experiences and
circumstances that existed before parenthood. This comprehensive collection of data is the
first of its kind and provides detailed information on the language and literacy skills of this
population. Despite the observed variability, it was determined that there is a need within this
population for literacy support for both mothers and their children. This research also
demonstrated differential changes in response to intervention when targeting the literacy
skills of the mothers, and the way in which they share books with their children. The most
positive changes were observed from the intervention that targeted shared book reading at
both a behavioural and linguistic level. Analysis of the linguistic characteristics of shared
reading interactions is a novel method of exploring response to intervention, and has not
previously been examined in the literature.",,,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/11377",,,"en",,,,,"University of Canterbury.

ABL is a compulsory part of many physical education curricula (IBO, 2010) yet there are few resources and still less research available to support teachers to effectively create such experiences in elementary physical education. This study seeks to address this gap and investigates how my facilitation of adventure based learning affects inter-personal attitudes and intra-personal skills in elementary students. It also attempts to find the most effective facilitation strategies to elevate a lesson from a fun activity to a meaningful learning experience. 
A multiple-iteration, teacher-based action research methodology has been adopted to allow the practitioner-as-researcher to design an adventure-based learning program for grade 4/5 students, then conduct it, reflect on the successes and challenges encountered and make modifications for an additional round of investigation. Multiple data sources including student interviews, critical friend observations, group surveys and student and teacher reflection journals have been used to polyangulate the data.
The thematic analysis found that intra-personal attitudes were difficult to plan for or measure and by contrast inter-personal skills were easier to plan for and were able to then be used to scaffold learning into more abstract concepts. Evidence from the first iteration of the research cycle indicated that the skill that needed the most attention was that of communication, which then became the design focus for the second round of data collection.   Five key themes emerged in the findings and discussion including “Intra or Inter”, “Being heard’, “The elusive art of facilitation”, “Know thyself” and “Know your students”. From these themes it became clear that rather than following a fixed protocol, the key to success appeared to centre on the role of the facilitator in adapting to changing demands of student needs and other external factors. The teacher must also know how to balance a pragmatic approach with meaningful facilitation of student’s reflection while understanding the diversity of needs within their classroom.",,,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/11354",,,"en",,,,,"University of Canterbury.

"13026","10092/806",,,,"Aburn, Robert John",,,,,,,"2015",,,"This thesis investigates a perceived dilemma, music teachers and students have about the significance and value aural and listening skills have in relation to Year 11 Music under the National Certificate in Educational Achievement (NCEA). The study considers four teachers’ approaches to the teaching and learning of aural and listening skills, which are based on their own contextual experiences. These experiences have assisted the teachers in the construction of their own knowledge on which they base their own beliefs and pedagogical approaches.
The teachers involved in this research collectively agreed that there were three important domains of musical activity, those of performing, composing and listening. Without the ability to ‘listen’, the other two musical activities become pointless. Aural training has been developed over time as a means of promoting critical listening and the ability to perceptively respond to aural stimuli. While there is dissent on the value music educationalists place on one aural skill over the other, it is generally agreed that a unified approach between aural recall and aural notation is the best approach.
An area of contention that has emerged from this research is the dichotomy between the performance practices of students focusing on the performance of classical and contemporary music. The discrepancy between students’ understanding of traditional music notation is one of the biggest tensions teachers face. With the perceived emphasis on traditional western notation, some teachers in this research believe that NCEA music assessment focuses on the teaching of traditional classical music notation and theory. Other teachers involved, dispute this fact and strategically decide not to enter students for the external aural examination. For these teachers, their approach is focused on the development of general musicianship skills as a means of further enhancing student performance work.
This thesis is practitioner research and developed from a teaching inquiry in an attempt to bring meaning and insight to an area of work that is believed to be critical to the holistic musical development of students.",,,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/11353",,,"en",,,,,"University of Canterbury.

The study considers how the discourses promoted by these communities are contested or employed by the teachers nominated as exemplary. Power relationships between adults, children and government are explored. 
Historical and contemporary developments in early childhood education and giftedness are investigated. Attention is paid to competing depictions of the infant, the toddler and giftedness. Dominant discourses and discursive images within international research literature are analysed and repositioned in relation to the Foucauldian oeuvre of the study. 
Within the findings it is argued that the construction of the term ‘exemplary’ is informed by discourses of giftedness, a developmental discourse, an ‘expert’ discourse and a neoliberal discourse. The governance of giftedness and gifted education is identified as crucial to the construction of the term exemplary within Aotearoa New Zealand. The notions of ‘rights’, ‘social justice’ and ‘empowerment’ are problematised, and the dominance of the discursive image of the child as ‘confident and competent’ in relation to giftedness is queried. 
Possibilities for further conversations between early childhood teachers and researchers on the concept of giftedness are explored.

"13794","10092/806",,,,"Ayebi-Arthur, Kofi",,,,,,,"2015",,,"When disasters and crises, both man-made and natural, occur, resilient higher education institutions adapt in order to continue teaching and research. This may necessitate the closure of the whole institution, a building and/or other essential infrastructure. In disasters of large scale the impact can be felt for many years. There is an increasing recognition of the need for disaster planning to restructure educational institutions so that they become more resilient to challenges including natural disasters (Seville, Hawker, & Lyttle, 2012).The University of Canterbury (UC) was affected by seismic events that resulted in the closure of the University in September 2010 for 10 days and two weeks at the start of the 2011 academic year
This case study research describes ways in which e-learning was deployed and developed by the University to continue and even to improve learning and teaching in the aftermath of a series of earthquakes in 2010 and 2011. A qualitative intrinsic embedded/nested single case study design was chosen for the study. The population was the management, support staff and educators at the University of Canterbury. Participants were recruited with purposive sampling using a snowball strategy where the early key participants were encouraged to recommend further participants. Four sources of data were identified: (1) documents such as policy, reports and guidelines; (2) emails from leaders of the colleges and academics; (3) communications from senior management team posted on the university website during and after the seismic activity of 2010 and 2011; and (4) semi-structured interviews of academics, support staff and members of senior management team. A series of inductive descriptive content analyses identified a number of themes in the data. The Technology Acceptance Model 2 (Venkatesh & Davis, 2000) and the Indicator of Resilience Model (Resilient Organisations, 2012) were used for additional analyses of each of the three cases.
Within the University case, the cases of two contrasting Colleges were embedded to produce a total of three case studies describing e-learning from 2000 - 2014. One contrast was the extent of e-learning deployment at the colleges: The College of Education was a leader in the field, while the College of Business and Law had relatively little e-learning at the time of the first earthquake in September 2010. The following six themes emerged from the analyses: Communication about crises, IT infrastructure, Availability of e-learning technologies, Support in the use of e-learning technologies, Timing of crises in academic year and Strategic planning for e-learning. One of the findings confirmed earlier research that communication to members of an organisation and the general public about crises and the recovery from crises is important. The use of communication channels, which students were familiar with and already using, aided the dissemination of the information that UC would be using e-learning as one of the options to complete the academic year. It was also found that e-learning tools were invaluable during the crises and facilitated teaching and learning whilst freeing limited campus space for essential activities and that IT infrastructure was essential to e-learning. The range of e-learning tools and their deployment evolved over the years influenced by repeated crises and facilitated by the availability of centrally located support from the e-Learning support team for a limited set of tools, as well as more localised support and collaboration with colleagues. Furthermore, the reasons and/or rate of e-learning adoption in an educational institution during crises varied with the time of the academic year and the needs of the institution at the time. The duration of the crises also affected the adoption of e-learning. Finally, UC’s lack of an explicit e-learning strategy influenced the two colleges to develop college-specific e-learning plans and those College plans complemented the incorporation of e-learning for the first time in the University’s teaching and learning strategy in 2013.
Twelve out of the 13 indicators of the Indicators of Resilience Model were found in the data collected for the study and could be explained using the model; it revealed that UC has become more resilient with e-learning in the aftermath of the seismic activities in 2010 and 2011. The interpretation of the results using TAM2 demonstrated that the adoption of technologies during crises aided in overcoming barriers to learning at the time of the crisis. The recommendations from this study are that in times of crises, educational institutions take advantage of Cloud computing to communicate with members of the institution and stakeholders. Also, that the architecture of a university’s IT infrastructure be made more resilient by increasing redundancy, backup and security, centralisation and Cloud computing. In addition, when under stress it is recommended that new tools are only introduced when they are essential.",,,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/11895",,,"en","English",,,,"University of Canterbury",,,,,,,"http://library.canterbury.ac.nz/thesis/etheses_copyright.shtml","All Rights Reserved",,,,,,,,,,,,"Resilience, e-learning and change in tertiary education.","Theses / Dissertations",,,,,"Education","University of Canterbury",,"Doctoral",,,"Doctor of Philosophy",,"2271231",,,"College of Education, Health and Human Development, University of Canterbury",,"ucresearchrepository@canterbury.ac.nz",,,,,,,,,"Professor Niki Davis and Associate Professor Una Cunningham"

Solution focused (SF) therapists often open sessions, subsequent to the first, with the question ‘What is better since we last met?’ with the purpose of enabling clients to gain a heightened sense of their own self efficacy. This research explores how clients and a solution focused therapist co-construct new meanings when having conversations about ‘What’s better?’
The study approaches this question from an interpretative perspective. Five clients agreed to be part of the research while engaging in solution-focused counselling. Each client met with the counsellor on up to five occasions during which time the ‘What’s better?’ question was asked. Following each session clients were asked to provide their perceptions on the session on client feedback forms. Excerpts transcribed from single sessions with different clients were microanalysed to determine how the co-construction process occurs.
The analysis revealed the collaborative and co-constructive character of Solution Focused Therapy conversations. The ‘What’s better?’ prompt led to a shift in meaning for clients. Comments made on the client feedback forms showed that the conversations raised greater awareness of their own achievements, competencies and positive aspects in their lives. Clients also expressed an increase in hope through conversations about ‘What’s better?’
The findings of this study build on research that suggests therapists’ discursive tools such as ‘questions’, ‘formulations’, ‘lexical choice’, and ‘grounding’ provide the means to influence therapeutic conversations. Analysis of dialogues in this study show that purposefully applied ‘compliments’, which do not fit into any previously identified discursive tools, can be useful for co-constructing new meanings.

This in vitro study looked at the modifiable factors of the technique to increase the effectiveness and efficiency. This is important as faster, more efficient, stone elimination would reduce symptom duration and limit the adverse effects of an acute episode of renal colic. Furthermore this would reduce the likelihood of incomplete fragmentation of the stones leading to readmission.
An in vitro model for the kidney was designed. This enabled the systematic scientific study of fragmentation and its relationship with the parameters studied: shock rate, shock power1, power ramping2, and coupling gel consistency to discover which technical factor settings allow the most effective and efficient urolith fragmentation. Mathematical models, theories and hypotheses pertaining to these phenomena were employed. Each effect was tested individually by setting up the model kidney and using the ESWL machine to fragment a mock kidney stone.
The results of 534 completed tests showed that shock rate had less impact on stone fragmentation than power in this model. The rate experiments showed no statistical difference between the rates tested; however our observational evidence showed that stone fragments after ESWL to be smaller and more dust-like at the lower rates (60 and 70 shockwaves per minute (SW/min)) than the larger more sand-like particles when the testing was completed at faster rates (90 and 100 SW/min). This may be of clinical significance. While examining power, the most effective and efficient power was 80%, however again the clinical significance of using higher powers may outweigh the time savings. The requirement of a gas free coupling cannot be stressed enough as the tests conducted without gas in the coupling medium required both fewer shocks and lower powers (p<0.001).
In conclusion, the results showed that diligent care during the ESWL procedure to choose the most effective and efficient shock rate and power, and the conscientious removal of gas from the coupling medium before treatment, improved the results of stone fragmentation.",,,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/11464",,,"en","English",,,,"University of Canterbury",,,,,,,"http://library.canterbury.ac.nz/thesis/etheses_copyright.shtml","All Rights Reserved",,,,,,,,,,,,"An examination of the modifiable technical factors of ESWL on effective and efficient urinary stone fragmentation","Theses / Dissertations",,,,,"Health Sciences","University of Canterbury",,"Masters",,,"Master of Health Sciences",,"2130425",,,"College of Education, Health and Human Development, University of Canterbury",,"ucresearchrepository@canterbury.ac.nz",,,,,,,,,"Professor Ann Richardson and Associate Professor Ray Kirk."

It explores how and why Technology teachers have developed this approach, how these traits are connected and inter-related to attitudes and the resulting dispositions they hold, and the philosophies they have developed. In the quest for sustainable conditions, enabling and inhibiting influences are also investigated.
To be fully inclusive of all aspects influencing TaI practice, aspects outside the location of individual inquiry are explored: How individual TaI exists within school culture, faculty, senior administrative and management philosophies within systems where the teacher is employed, and how TaI practice exists within wider national policy. It explains how TaI in New Zealand, appears to flourish within a foundation of Culturally Responsive Pedagogies. It also suggests a simple re-consideration around the nature of individual learners, and how their needs to develop responsive and effective pedagogies, seeing a different ‘new construct, end-goal’ of future focussed schooling, could conflict with immediate current assessment, and compliance needs. This study concludes by suggesting a set of ideal facilitating conditions that together could enable the development of philosophies supporting the effective pedagogies of Teaching as Inquiry.",,,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/12163",,,"en","English",,,,"University of Canterbury",,,,,,,"http://library.canterbury.ac.nz/thesis/etheses_copyright.shtml","All Rights Reserved",,,,,,,,,,,,"What are the facilitating conditions that support teaching as inquiry (TaI) for secondary technology teachers who are middle leaders in greater Christchurch?","Theses / Dissertations",,,,,"Education","University of Canterbury",,"Masters",,,"Master of Education",,"2317075",,,"College of Education, Health and Human Development, University of Canterbury",,"catherinejohnson40@gmail.com",,,,,,,,,"Dr Wendy Fox-Turnbull"
"16218","10092/806",,,,"Abdelsabour, Shaimaa",,,,,,,"2016",,,"Arabic (L1) and English (L2) language and literacy skills in Grade 3 children were examined to determine the predictors of literacy skills in L1 and L2 across Grades 3 and 4. Eighty-two Arabic-speaking children from Kuwait participated in the two-year longitudinal study. Children were followed from Grade 3 (when formal literacy instruction of L2 begins in the state of Kuwait) to the end of Grade 4. A battery of tests was used to measure language and literacy skills in both languages at six-month intervals. This included measures of decoding skills (non-word reading), vocabulary, phonological skills (phonological awareness, rapid automatized naming and phonological memory), orthographic skills (orthographic segmentation, orthographic discrimination and visual memory), morpho-syntactic skills (syntactic awareness and morphological segmentation), and literacy skills (isolated word reading, reading fluency, reading comprehension, comprehension fluency, word spelling, text spelling and writing composition).

Results argued for basic skills to support more complex literacy skills in both reading and writing. For example, the data showed that decoding explained variance in literacy skills in both Arabic and English, and spelling levels were predictive of writing performance in both languages too. Vocabulary, on the other hand, showed less contribution than decoding to literacy in both languages, even when measures of reading comprehension were considered. Phonological awareness influenced literacy mainly via word recognition factors (particularly decoding), whereas rapid naming demonstrated a direct relationship with a number of literacy measures, particularly when fluency was required. While phonological memory was less predictive of literacy than the other measures of phonological skills, it was a significant predictor of non-vowelised Arabic reading comprehension. Although early phonological processing skills were not the predominant predictors of early Arabic literacy, they predicted Arabic literacy in Grade 4, when children begin reading non-vowelised school texts. The data also argued for orthographic skills (which included orthographic discrimination, orthographic segmentation and visual memory) to be better predictors of literacy than phonological skills, particularly for fully vowelised Arabic texts, a finding that may be consistent with views about the complexity of the fully vowelised Arabic script. In addition, measures of morpho-syntactic skills predicted literacy levels in both languages; and these skills were related to vocabulary suggesting an overlap between the development of vocabulary and the processing of morpho-syntactic features within this cohort of students.

Overall, the findings suggest that a Simple View of Reading and Writing could be applied to Arabic in a similar way to English. However, additional factors related to orthographic segmentation and rapid naming are included as important factors in the Arabic model. Furthermore, the relationships between vocabulary and morpho-syntactic skills are taken into account. Given the need for modifications, a model is proposed that includes these additional factors and which is discussed in light of previous research and theories in the field.",,,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/13493",,,"en","English",,,,"University of Canterbury",,,,,,,"http://library.canterbury.ac.nz/thesis/etheses_copyright.shtml","All Rights Reserved",,,,,,,,,,,,"The influence of language skills on literacy acquisition in Arabic/English bilinguals.",,,"Electronic Thesis or Dissertation",,"Education",,"University of Canterbury",,"Doctoral",,,"Doctor of Philosophy",,"2486127",,,"College of Education, Health and Human Development, University of Canterbury",,"ucresearchrepository@canterbury.ac.nz",,,,,,,,,"Prof. John Everatt"
"13170","10092/806","",,,"Buabeng, Isaac",,,,,,,"2015",,,"The main aim of this study was to gain insight into physics education in the New Zealand education system. The study sought insight into policies and practices that might promote excellence in physics teaching practices and also improve the number of students, and possibly teachers, involved. It also investigated how approaches to teaching high school physics in New Zealand influence students’ perceptions of physics and their consequent desire to continue with physics studies beyond high school level. The study also investigated whether tertiary study adequately prepared and allowed pre-service teachers to become effective in their job. The overarching research question formulated to guide the study was: What are the current practices for teaching physics in New Zealand high schools and how might they be improved if they are not effective?
The study was underpinned by the constructivist theory and cognitive apprenticeship model. The reason is that students must be active participants and engaged in their own learning in order for meaningful learning to occur. Constructivism as a theory, has evolved from not only learning about declarative knowledge (knowing what) but also knowing “how and when” to learn in different ways. Accordingly, the teacher acts as a facilitator or mediator of learning rather than someone who only takes on the role of imparting knowledge. The cognitive apprenticeship model also presumes that learners should be exposed to the teaching methods that give students the chance to observe, engage in, invent, and discover expert strategies in context. Accordingly, the teaching methods should systematically encourage student exploration and independence.
The convergent parallel design (Creswell & Clark, 2011) of this study used mixed methods, including a national survey of physics teachers throughout New Zealand, a student survey, as well as classroom observations and interviews with high school physics teachers, high school students and initial teacher educators who were coordinating the physics education programmes. The sample size for the study comprised 104 high school physics teachers across New Zealand; 85 high school physics students from selected schools in Christchurch; and three physics teacher educators in three selected universities.
Data from teachers and students’ survey questionnaires were analysed using descriptive statistical methods (including percentages, means, standard deviations and graphs where appropriate) and inferential statistics – independent samples test and multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA). Audio recordings from interviews were transcribed and coded into nodes which provided easy retrieval of the themes that emerged. Detailed descriptions of classroom observations/practices were also recorded as a reference for indicating what actually occurred. The cases were compared for similarities and differences.
The research findings indicate that generally, physics classroom dialogue tended not to support constructivist epistemology or inquiry based teaching and learning. Student-centred instructional approaches were not common in many physics classes. The use of more traditional teaching approaches for physics contributed to students thinking that physics is a difficult subject and not something they want to participate in further. Some students in this study took physics because it is a requirement for future qualifications such as for engineering or medicine.
The findings of the study also indicated that there was a lack of alignment between the aspirations of the New Zealand Curriculum (NZC), which promotes inquiry-based approaches to teaching and learning, and how physics is actually being taught. The teachers who participated in the research however, believed that several factors hindered the quality teaching and learning of physics at high school. The teachers believed that physics teaching in New Zealand is driven by assessment, not by student interests, and that schools place too much emphasis on performance and grades. The teachers felt that their ability to focus on improving teaching and learning was compromised by the time spent addressing assessment requirements.
Findings from the study also provided insight about physics teachers’ preparation and indicated that the physics education programmes for would-be physics teachers generally do not cover content knowledge for the subject. That is, the would-be physics teacher education programmes are primarily about pedagogical content knowledge (PCK). The teachers perceived that their initial teacher qualification did not adequately prepare them to teach some of the content areas now in the curriculum. Also, there is no national teacher education curriculum and teacher education providers have the freedom to design their own courses.
Among other things, the findings from the research lead to a conclusion that the emphasis on high stakes assessment has led teachers to concentrate more on the assessment tasks for senior physics students rather than on preparing inquiry-based lessons that would facilitate conceptual change and stimulate students’ interest in the subject. The teachers considered that limited time to work with students and assessment demands, with its heavy workload, had worsened the problem of finding time to prepare interesting physics lessons.
Based on the findings from the research, seven recommendations were made. Teachers’ ability to focus on improving teaching and learning, through innovative approaches, was compromised by the time spent addressing assessment requirements. Current assessment practices and high teacher workloads need to change so that teachers can spend more time to prepare interesting lessons and to explore topics in greater depth, thereby, helping to develop students’ interest to learn physics more. The subject could be made less demanding by reducing the number of topics/concepts covered in the senior levels. After all, the NZC stresses that schools should keep assessment to levels that are manageable for both students and teachers.",,,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/11396",,,"en","English",,,,"University of Canterbury",,,,,,,"http://library.canterbury.ac.nz/thesis/etheses_copyright.shtml","All Rights Reserved",,,,,,,,,,,,"Teaching and Learning of Physics in New Zealand High Schools","Theses / Dissertations",,,,,"Education","University of Canterbury",,"Doctoral",,,"Doctor of Philosophy",,"2130051",,,"College of Education, Health and Human Development, University of Canterbury",,"isaac.buabeng@pg.canterbury.ac.nz",,,,,,,,,"Professor Lindsey Conner"

The results of the study found that both VM and VSM interventions assisted in increasing the purchasing skills acquisition for all 6 participants. The VM intervention was more effective in teaching the Next Dollar Strategy compared to the VSM intervention. However, only one participant of the 6 was able to master the Next Dollar Strategy and maintain it through the follow-up and generalisation phases.

"13161","10092/806",,,,"Shamsuzzaman, Mohammad",,,,,,,"2015",,,"This thesis reports the findings of three studies designed to investigate the influences of backgrounds on learners and instructors in learning and teaching second language (L2) writing in English. The participants, thus, were learners and instructors of L2 writing in English. The studies took place in the ESL context of New Zealand and in the EFL context of Bangladesh. The first two studies focused on how learners from various linguistic, academic, and cultural backgrounds learned to write in English. The third study demonstrated how instructors’ academic training and the context of teaching influenced their modes of teaching L2 writing in English in Bangladesh.
In the first study, 30 participants were recruited from an English Language College in New Zealand. All participants were honing their English language skills in order to embark on undergraduate or graduate studies in New Zealand. Their proficiency in the English language was similar given the results of a placement test. The age of participants ranged from 16-40 years, and they came from such countries as China, Thailand, Indonesia, Japan, and Colombia. Participants were divided based on Chinese (N=20) and non-Chinese (N=10) backgrounds. All participants completed background questionnaires, grammaticality judgement tests, vocabulary tests, and writing tasks. A critical finding of this study was that for the non-Chinese participants both vocabulary and grammar tests’ scores correlated with the scores of the writing test; however, for the Chinese learners, scores in the vocabulary test did not correlate with those of the writing and grammar tests. This suggested that the L2 writers across cultures and languages did not learn to write in English exactly alike, though participants of this study also demonstrated some similar areas of L2 writing development. The study reinforced the caution about generalizing L2 writers across languages, cultures, and academic backgrounds.
The second study included 70 undergraduate students from a private university in the capital city of Bangladesh, Dhaka. The age of the participants ranged from 17-24 years, and their native language was Bangla. English language development was similar across participants given the results of an admission test and the mandatory pre-requisite English courses taken. Participants completed background questionnaires, vocabulary tests, grammaticality judgement tests, and writing tasks in English and Bangla. Participants also completed a questionnaire that gleaned information about their perceptions of writing in English and Bangla. One of the critical findings of the study was the cross-language correlations between essays, implying that a strong or a weak writer in a first language would show similar ability levels in an L2. This study suggested that the teaching of L2 writing in English should be based on an appreciation of how the development of writing in an L1 can help or hinder the development of writing in an L2.
The third study focused on L2 writing instructors at different public and private universities in Bangladesh. This study included 46 participants who completed background questionnaires, provided feedback on a piece of writing and completed questionnaires that gleaned information regarding their styles and strategies of providing feedback. The study revealed that the areas of specialization in English studies between the junior and senior instructors significantly varied--senior instructors specialized mostly in literature, whereas the junior instructors mostly specialized in language-related areas. Despite this, their practice and perceptions of teaching L2 writing across the universities in Bangladesh did not vary significantly. This may change over time as instructors with language -area specializations become the majority in the future.
The three studies of this thesis shifted the focus from learning to teaching L2 writing across contexts and languages. The findings should inform explanation of why learners from different linguistic and cultural backgrounds, and with differing language abilities, learned or failed to learn to write in English. Furthermore, empirical data were presented to appreciate influences on instruction which in turn would influence the ways learners learn L2 writing in English. Such findings should support the development of theories and practices in the teaching and learning of L2 writing.",,,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/11391",,,"en","English",,,,"University of Canterbury",,,,,,,"http://library.canterbury.ac.nz/thesis/etheses_copyright.shtml","All Rights Reserved",,,,,,,,,,,,"Perceptions and practices in learning and teaching second language writing in English : influences of backgrounds and language skills.","Theses / Dissertations",,,,,"Education","University of Canterbury",,"Doctoral",,,"Doctor of Philosophy",,"2130431",,,"College of Education, Health and Human Development, University of Canterbury",,"ucresearchrepository@canterbury.ac.nz",,,,,,,,,"Professor John Everatt"

"14931","10092/806",,,,"Wilson, Leanne",,,,,,,"2016",,,"Ensuring teacher and speech and language therapists (SLTs) are prepared to work collaboratively together is an important goal towards meeting the diverse language and literacy learning needs of children. Inter-professional education (IPE) is a potentially effective approach for preparing prospective teachers and SLTs for this challenging task. Despite the potential benefits of IPE, investigation of applications for student SLTs and student teachers are scarce. The series of five studies in this thesis examined student SLTs’ and student teachers’ readiness for collaboration and investigated the effectiveness of novel IPE interventions designed to enhance these prospective professionals’ shared competencies for collaborative language and literacy instruction.
The first study examined various aspects of student teachers’ and student SLTs’ collaborative competencies. An online survey was completed by 58 student primary school teachers and 37 student SLTs from multiple universities across New Zealand who were near completion of their professional study. The results indicated that these groups possessed limited understanding of each other’s expertise areas in literacy curriculum and spoken language concepts. Both groups also demonstrated limited understanding of linguistic concepts denoting the relationship between spoken and written language. Participants demonstrated an emerging sense of inter-dependent co-working as evidenced by acceptance of classroom-based co-work among SLTs and teachers. They were, however, less accepting of co-working models which demand a greater degree of collaboration between SLTs and teachers. Both groups also reported minimal experience with SLT-teacher collaboration during their pre-service education. The data suggested that IPE with a focus on children’s early literacy learning was warranted for student teachers and student SLTs.
The second study investigated the efficacy of a 3-hour, course-based IPE initiative focused on explicit instruction in the language skills that underpin early reading and spelling acquisition. The combined programme incorporated student teachers and student SLTs working together on case-based instructional planning supplemented with structured opportunities for the groups to share their respective expertise in curriculum and linguistic knowledge. Student teachers (n=18) and student SLTs (n=27) were randomly assigned to this combined intervention or a comparison intervention that replaced the structured opportunities to share curriculum and linguistic knowledge with spending time together focused on non-language/literacy based activities. Before-and-after comparisons indicated that only the students in the combined condition increased their linguistic/curricular knowledge (p<0.05). However, neither of the interventions improved students’ case-based instructional planning for children’s literacy learning over and above what they could achieve working individually.
In the third study, ten student SLTs and nine student teachers who participated in the course-based IPE were interviewed to examine their perceptions of the IPE. An inductive thematic analysis of interview data revealed that IPE participants developed a preliminary understanding of each other’s professional roles and gained an appreciation of the importance of inter-professional knowledge for collaborative co-working. Overall, participants valued the inter-professional interactions though some participants reported interactive learning was limited by students not yet developing adequate understanding of their own profession-specific expertise and by perceived differences in status. Interview analysis also revealed that students required more time to develop depth of understanding of each other’s professional roles and that embedding IPE into practical experience may enhance inter-professional learning. The results thus supported further investigation into the impact of IPE embedded within students’ professional practice placements.
The fourth study employed a multiple case study design to examine the impact of placement-based IPE in which student SLTs (n=4) were paired with student teachers (n=4) to participate in shared professional practice placements in junior school classrooms. Student pairs co-worked to provide classroom-based instruction to foster children’s speech and phonological awareness development over a 3-week period. An inductive thematic analysis of interviews conducted with participants after the IPE was employed to explore their development of competencies in collaborative practice. Change in inter-disciplinary knowledge and perceptions over the IPE was evaluated via survey to further explore development of collaborative competencies. Integration of qualitative and quantitative findings suggested that most participants began to develop four broad areas of collaborative competency: understanding of professional roles and expertise, communication skills to support shared decision making, inter-dependency in supporting children’s learning, and flexibility to implement alternative instructional practices. Interview analysis also revealed factors related to the facilitators and learning contexts that supported and/or limited the collaboration between participants.
The fifth study examined the impact of the placement-based IPE on the speech, phonological awareness and early literacy skills of the children with whom each of the four student pairs instructed. A multiple single-subject design with repeated measures was employed to examine the impact of the IPE on children’s development. Seven children who demonstrated difficulties with speech and/or phonological awareness participated in 3 weeks of classroom-based instruction, delivered by student SLT-teacher pairs, to target these areas of difficulty. Four out of seven children (who were each instructed by a different student pair) improved on at least one of the two goal areas. More specifically, two out of six children improved their production of trained and untrained speech targets. Three out of seven children also improved on phoneme segmentation of trained and untrained words. Further, these children’s improvement in phoneme awareness was also accompanied by improved letter-sound knowledge and spelling. Moreover, three out of the four children who demonstrated improved speech and/or phoneme awareness received a collaborative approach to instruction as suggested by student professionals’ instructional logs and the results presented in Study 4. The findings further supported the effectiveness of the placement-based IPE in that most of the students could learn to establish classroom-based collaboration which positively impacted children’s speech and early literacy outcomes.
The findings from this thesis suggest a need for coordinated reform of the professional study of SLTs and teachers to ensure these professional groups develop shared competencies for collaborative instruction in children’s language and literacy learning. The potential benefits of IPE demonstrated in this thesis challenge the current practice of SLTs and teachers being educated in professional siloes which likely restrict the development of collaborative-ready practitioners. Given the novelty of IPE for prospective SLTs and teachers, improvements to the design of IPE models utilised in this thesis and directions for further research are also emphasised.",,,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/12244",,,"en","English",,,,"University of Canterbury",,,,,,,"http://library.canterbury.ac.nz/thesis/etheses_copyright.shtml","All Rights Reserved",,,,,,,,,,,,"Advancing collaboration among prospective teachers and speech language therapists to improve children's language and early literacy outcomes","Theses / Dissertations",,,,,"Education","University of Canterbury",,"Doctoral",,,"Doctor of Philosophy",,"2321951",,,"College of Education, Health and Human Development, University of Canterbury",,"lean.wils@gmail.com",,,,,,,,,"Dr Brigid McNeill"

This transition is driven by the Ministry of Education property division who have
specific guidelines for designing new schools, re-builds and the five and ten year
property plan requirements. Boards of Trustees, school leaders and teachers are
faced with the challenge of reconceptualising teaching and learning from private
autonomous learning environments to co-teaching in Flexible Learning Spaces
provisioned for 50 to 180 children and two to six teachers in a single space. This
process involves risks and opportunities especially for teachers and children.

1970’s open plan era and the views of 40 experienced practitioners and leaders with
two or more years’ experience working in collaborative teaching and learning
environments in sixteen New Zealand and Australian schools. The research also
considers teacher collaboration and co-teaching as evidenced in literature.
The findings lead to the identification of eight key components required to create

three themes of student centeredness, effective pedagogy and collaboration. Six key
recommendations are provided to support the effective co-teaching in a flexible

Data was collected via a mixed method design that included two-hour direct observation of the teacher during a typical day and individual teacher interviews. The findings indicate that all eight teachers identified both externalising and internalising challenging behaviours and referred to the child’s social environment as contributing to challenging behaviour.

Little reference was given to their ECE teacher training or to the early childhood curriculum, Te Whāriki, indicating a gap between theory and practice.

The challenge has been set.

Gaining access to effective and appropriate support for Māori children with special needs in a Māori medium education context is a process that can create many challenges for whānau, educators, support staff and the child. The aim of this study was to gain insight into the following research question ‘me pēhea te tautoko i ngā tamariki hauā i roto i ngā horopaki akoranga reo Māori? How do we best support Māori children with special needs in Māori medium education settings?’ The motivation for this study arose from personal experiences and challenges in raising a child with special needs whose first language is te reo Māori. The study consisted of three phases. The first phase focussed on reviewing current and historical policy and legislation relevant to accessing te reo Māori within educational settings for Māori children, and secondly to all children with special needs in Aotearoa. The second phase of the study examined the approaches employed by early childhood and primary Māori medium educational settings (i.e. settings that use te reo Māori as the language of instruction 80% to 100% of the time), in regards to nurturing and teaching children with special education needs. The study had a particular focus on the approaches towards four children with difficulties in language development and language delay. Data was collected by way of interviews with whānau and educators who provided evidence and reflected on their experiences of gaining support for Māori children with special needs in Māori medium settings. A total of 15 individual and group interviews were conducted with parents, whānau, educators, kaiāwhina and principals who agreed to participate in this research project. The third phase of the study involved analysing these findings and developing a strategic framework with the intent of providing guidance for the Ministry of Education’s Special Education Services, kura and whānau in developing suitable provisions for children with special needs who are educated through the medium of te reo Māori. The key findings reflected the need for and importance of effective resourcing and provision specifically tailored to the needs of Māori children with special needs who are educated within a Māori medium context. An adaptation of the current mainstream model and provision will simply not suffice.
It has become apparent to the researcher during this journey that there are other whānau throughout Aotearoa1 who have experienced similar pressures and prejudices in regards to raising a child with special needs through te reo Māori me ōna tikanga.

understanding and experiences of teaching and including children from
Asian backgrounds, in particular, Korean, Chinese and Japanese cultures.
In Aotearoa New Zealand, participation in early childhood education of
diverse ethnic groups is growing every year. Since 2004, the largest
growth in enrolments has been among Asian ethnic groups, with an
increase of 90%. The New Zealand Early Childhood Curriculum, Te
Whāriki, states “there are many migrants in New Zealand, and, as in any
country with a multicultural heritage, there is a diversity of beliefs about
childrearing practices, kinship roles, obligations, codes of behaviour, and
what kinds of knowledge are valuable” (Ministry of Education, 1996, p.
18). It is therefore important that teachers in the early childhood
education service sector are able to effectively respond to the holistic
learning needs and well-being of children and families from different
ethnicities. This research explores what culturally inclusive and
responsive teaching means in the New Zealand early childhood setting
and looks at some of the barriers to and facilitators of creating learning
environments that meet the needs of children from Asian cultural
backgrounds.

Data was collected through interviews and questionnaires from
teachers working in different early childhood centres in Christchurch.
The information gathered was reviewed and evaluated using thematic analysis and the findings were considered in the context of a number of
themes – from the teachers’ perceptions of Asian parents and families as
influenced by their own experience, to their ideas about progressing
inclusive education for children and families from Asian cultural
backgrounds. This work highlights some strategies that may help
progress cultural inclusion. It also outlines current research and identifies
the need for more exemplars for teachers and for further research in this
area.",,,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/13391",,,"en","English",,,,"University of Canterbury",,,,,,,"http://library.canterbury.ac.nz/thesis/etheses_copyright.shtml","All Rights Reserved",,,,,,,,,,,,"Teachers’ experiences of including children and families from Asian cultural backgrounds in early childhood education.",,,"Electronic Thesis or Dissertation",,"Education",,"University of Canterbury",,"Masters",,,"Master of Education",,"2483540",,,"College of Education, Health and Human Development, University of Canterbury",,"Ivana.youn@gmail.com",,,,,,,,,"Kerry Purdue"

cycle. For assessment to promote learning and inform teaching, better understanding the students’ 
perspectives of effective assessment methods is critical. When ELL students have access to quality 
teaching, curriculum and assessment, they are more likely to become motivated to improve 
English language learning, and reach their full potential. Adopting contextually relevant formative 
assessment approaches in adult ELL education can enhance learning the English in authentic 
situations. However, some types of assessment related issues may hinder learning and cause 
students frustration. 
This qualitative study explores adult ELL students’ perceptions of formative assessment strategies 
that support their learning. It aims to identify effective formative assessment practices in adult ELL 
classrooms. Data was collected using several observations of two ELL classrooms, two 
semi-structured interviews and a questionnaire with a range of adult ELL students. The two 
interviews were conducted with a group of fourteen adult ELL students who came from different 
backgrounds and ethnicities. 
The study uncovered some effective strategies that could be implemented to enhance English 
language learning when using formative assessment. These include maintaining a positive 
atmosphere, using a variety of formative assessments, along with acknowledging individual and 
cultural differences. These were identified by the adult students as major factors that can affect 
their English language learning. Results also indicated that using formative assessment is a valued 
means to enhance ELL adult students’ English language learning. However, some students 
stressed the importance of practising summative assessment as well as formative assessment. The 
effectiveness of formative assessment, according to students’ perceptions, is associated with 
enhancing a positive atmosphere and being motivated and valued as individuals. 
Additionally, my research findings suggest the need for professional development in the use of contextually related formative assessment practices as a means of ongoing assessment for adult English language learners.",,,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/12434",,,"en","English",,,,"University of Canterbury",,,,,,,"http://library.canterbury.ac.nz/thesis/etheses_copyright.shtml","All Rights Reserved",,,,,,,,,,,,"An exploration of formative assessment that can support ELL  adult students in  New Zealand.","Theses / Dissertations",,,,,"Education","University of Canterbury",,"Masters",,,"Master of Education",,"2362372",,,"College of Education, Health and Human Development, University of Canterbury",,"ucresearchrepository@canterbury.ac.nz",,,,,,,,,"Faye Parkhill and Jo Fletcher"

Intervention in these problems, however, failed to develop clinically significant changes in almost one third of the children referred to in the literature. Study 1 was designed to evaluate the effect of Child Parent Relationship Therapy (CPRT) and Level-4 Positive Parenting Programme (Standard Triple P) on children (aged 4-6) with behavioural problems in four families, using a single-subject design. Results indicated that CPRT promoted high levels of parent engagement and increased positive parenting skills, and the therapy reduced child behavioural problems in two families. In the light of the findings, it was decided to investigate CPRT further with a particular examination of whether the gains observed early in the therapy meant that a shorter duration programme may be as effective. The original 10-session CPRT was revised and a manual for a 5-session adapted CPRT was developed by incorporating three key components identified as effective in the intervention. These were (a) deconstruction-and-reconstruction of parents’ negative attribution of child behaviour problems; (b) the basic child-centred play strategies; (c) two home visits, one for a live demonstration of child-centred play sessions and another for the supervision and coaching of parent-child play sessions. Study 2 was designed to evaluate the effects of the adapted CPRT on eight parent-child dyads using multiple-baseline single-subject designs and to explore its effects within each family. Observation data revealed a clear relationship between training in intervention strategies and changes in parent behaviour, which resulted in beneficial changes in child behaviour. Visual analysis indicated improvements in targeted child positive and negative behaviours across all children. The pre- and post-intervention analyses suggested that adapted CPRT reduced child behavioural problems and parenting related stress, while improving child self-concept. In contrast to other studies, all the children in Study 2 showed clinically significant improvement in their behaviour and this was maintained at a 3-month follow-up.

"15052","10092/806",,,,"Keefe, Emily",,,,,,,"2016",,,"Background
This descriptive explorative study had two aims. Firstly, to survey the use of mobile phones by health professionals for photographing patients, their body parts/organs or confidential patient information in the clinical setting of a DHB. The second aim was to explore the perceptions and attitudes of health professionals in regard to the DHB’s policy on photographic recordings. It was hoped that results would show whether there was a need for update of local policy, which would in turn provide clarification of the responsibilities that health professionals have in maintaining the confidentiality of patient images on personal mobile devices. Overseas evidence suggests that ownership and use of mobile phones for their photographic capabilities in the healthcare setting is high. However, until now, no research has been conducted in New Zealand. The clinical mobile phone photography practices of health professionals in New Zealand has major implications for maintaining the confidentiality of the patient record and the integrity of the medical photography profession.
Method
An online survey comprising 36 questions was distributed via email to all nursing, medical and allied health staff members employed at the local DHB. The survey was open for responses for a three week period from late September to mid October 2015.
Key findings
951 completed responses were received. A third of respondents (33.1%, n=306) had taken photographs of patient or patient information using a mobile phone yet written consent was obtained by only 28.4% (n=87) of respondents. When consent was obtained, verbal was the most popular method (85.9%, n=263) with 40.8% (n=125) of respondents rarely or never recording in the patient’s notes that they took photographs.
The most common location for storing images taken personally was on the mobile phone itself (45.7%, n=106). Respondents were more likely to take non-identifiable images than identifiable images on their mobile phones. Them most common reason for taking photographs of patient or patient information was for input from another health professional (26.5%, n=252), 17.3% (n=164) for education/training purposes and 9.5% (n=90) for presentations.
Three-quarters of respondents were either unaware of local policy regarding photographic recordings or were aware of it but had not read it. The majority of respondents thought that the patient owned images taken on health professionals’ mobile phones (65.2%, n=691).
Conclusion
Despite being the first study of its kind in New Zealand, evidence suggests that a proportion of health professionals are utilising mobile phone technology to perform photography in the clinical setting. Most health professionals are aware of their responsibilities surrounding maintenance of patient privacy. However, as mobile phone photography is becoming increasingly common in patient care, evidence here suggests that not all health professionals understand the value they hold and are unaware of their responsibilities for managing the safe storage and movement of these images. Update of local policy in line with professional medical photography guidelines is required to match advancement in technological capabilities available to health professionals. This would improve the integrity and safe handling of images that form part of the confidential patient record.",,,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/12486",,,"en","English",,,,"University of Canterbury",,,,,,,"http://library.canterbury.ac.nz/thesis/etheses_copyright.shtml","All Rights Reserved",,,,,,,,,,,,"What is the risk to safety and confidentiality in light of advancing mobile technology for patients undergoing hospital treatment in New Zealand? : a descriptive exploratory study.","Theses / Dissertations",,,,,"Health Sciences","University of Canterbury",,"Masters",,,"Master of Health Sciences",,"2365510",,,"College of Education, Health and Human Development, University of Canterbury",,"Emily.keefe@yahoo.co.nz",,,,,,,,,"Dr Isabel Jamieson"

Previous research has focused significantly on the adult cohort, specifically looking at the medical symptoms with very little focus on children and adolescents and the psychological affect that is likely to be present. The focus of the present study was on families living with children who had been diagnosed with IBD and were under the age of 16 years old.
The aim of this study was gain an insight and to hear the stories of these families and their journey with IBD, and to determine if these individuals are affected by psychological symptoms. Four mothers who had children diagnosed with IBD were interviewed using a semi structured interview method to gain insight into their journey.
The results indicate that families and children with an IBD diagnosis all experience psychological symptoms as well as challenges within their own family cohort, including comorbid disorders such as anxiety and a family divide when the sick child was chronically ill.
The findings of this study uncovered seven common themes and a number of subthemes relating directly to noticeable changes or challenges that they were faced namely these were; the effect on the child’s characteristics, guilt, school, difficulty forming and maintaining relationships, academic difficulty, emotional toll on family, divided family, financial stressors and psychological support. These psychological effects could be due to a number of factors including, the medication that the children are required to take and the developmental stage that they are in.
Future research in this area could further develop this study by gaining perspective from the fathers, siblings and individuals themselves.",,,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/12981",,,"en","English",,,,"University of Canterbury",,,,,,,"http://library.canterbury.ac.nz/thesis/etheses_copyright.shtml","All Rights Reserved",,,,,,,,,,,,"The experiences of families who have a child living with inflammatory bowel disease : their stories.","Theses / Dissertations",,,,,"Health Sciences","University of Canterbury",,"Masters",,,"Master of Science",,"2406477",,,"College of Education, Health and Human Development, University of Canterbury",,"becwoolman@hotmail.com",,,,,,,,,"Kate Reid"

The current investigation extends this work by comparing and contrasting the style and degree of parental involvement in two small samples of New Zealand parents. Participants: A total of 22 Chinese New Zealand (CNZ) and 21 European New Zealand (ENZ) parents of primary school-aged children living in Christchurch, New Zealand, were recruited. Participants were primarily female (71.4% of ENZ and 81.8% of CNZ) with a mean age of 38 years (SD = 4.87). Method: A mixed methodology was employed in the current study to compare and contrast the ENZ and CNZ parents’ differences in their PI behaviors, beliefs, perceptions of the effectiveness of their PI, perceived contextual barriers, as well as idiosyncratic experiences of PI. In addition, the acculturation of the CNZ participants and their children was also examined. Findings: CNZ parents reported a higher level of involvement in establishing a home learning environment and applying rules for media/technology use for children than ENZ parents. CNZ parents also held stronger parental expectations for their children’s educational future and perceived greater positive receptivity from the school and child to their PI efforts than ENZ parents. Both ENZ and CNZ parents’ level of involvement across all three types of PI support were highly associated with parental expectations of children’s education future, and parents’ perceptions of their children’s receptivity to their PI effort. The path between ethnicity and parents’ involvement in establishing a home learning environment was fully mediated by parents’ expectations and parents’ self-efficacy of PI skills and experiences. Likewise, the path between ethnicity and parents’ involvement level in applying rules for media/technology use for children was fully mediated by parents’ expectations. Qualitative data showed that CNZ parents’ beliefs in education are results-oriented, while the ENZ parents place more value on the learning process. Meanwhile, CNZ parents believe that parental instructions should be organized and structured, while ENZ parents consider PI more effective when it is innovative. Discussion: The results are discussed from Walker and colleagues (2005) and Hornby and Lafaele’s (2011) theoretical models of PI. The results from the present study show that although PI expressions varied largely based on parents’ ethnicity, these PI variances based on ethnicity can be fully explained by the discrepancies between ENZ and CNZ parents’ psychological factors (parental expectations and self-efficacy) of PI. This suggests that cultural factors help shape parental expectations and beliefs concerning children’s education, which then influences the extent and expression of parental involvement.",,,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/12980",,,"en","English",,,,"University of Canterbury",,,,,,,"http://library.canterbury.ac.nz/thesis/etheses_copyright.shtml","All Rights Reserved",,,,,,,,,,,,"Cultural background and parental involvement in children’s education : a mixed-method study comparing Chinese and European New Zealand parents.","Theses / Dissertations",,,,,"Health Sciences","University of Canterbury",,"Masters",,,"Master of Arts",,"2406478",,,"College of Education, Health and Human Development, University of Canterbury",,"ucresearchrepository@canterbury.ac.nz",,,,,,,,,"Myron Friesen"

The perspective of a classroom teacher on the inclusion of children with Down syndrome in a regular classroom was also gathered. The peer interactions of a small group of typically developing students in a regular classroom were examined, along with their attitudes towards peers with disabilities and their social skills. Findings indicated that typically developing students interacted primarily with their peers about academic tasks. All of the students displayed neutral or positive attitudes towards peers with disabilities and a positive correlation was found between their attitudes and social skills. The parents and teacher reported experiencing both inclusive and non-inclusive practices at regular schools, and suggested that teacher attitudes towards inclusion could be improved to increase inclusive practices. The parents and teacher reported that specific training in inclusive practices should be provided. It was concluded from these findings that there is a shortfall between policy and the practices of teachers in regular classrooms.

"15085","10092/806",,,,"Smit, Anna K.",,,,,,,"2016",,,"Positive Youth Development (PYD) comprises three interrelated aspects: (1) a 
developmental process, (2) an approach to youth programmes, and (3) specific instances of 
organisations or youth programmes that aim to promote positive or healthy development 
among adolescents. New Zealand has committed to a PYD approach to youth development; 
however, there is yet to be any research exploring the implementation of PYD in New 
Zealand youth programmes. The present study explored the application of PYD in 24-7 
YouthWork, a nationally implemented New Zealand youth development programme. More 
specifically, the objectives of this study were to (1) evaluate whether a PYD approach is 
reflected in the 24-7 Youth Work programme; (2) examine if stakeholders in different roles 
within 24-7 and across different schools concur about the PYD programme components that 
24-7 is promoting; and (3) explore additional strengths and potential challenges that 24-7 
Youth Work has that are outside of the PYD framework. An in-depth review of the key PYD 
theoretical and applied literature was conducted to establish an integrated PYD programme 
framework. Using Deductive Qualitative Analysis (DQA), this PYD programme framework 
was then applied in an evaluation of three Christchurch-based 24-7 YouthWork programmes. 
Nine participants (3 from each programme) representing three important roles in the 24-7 
programme (former participant, youth worker, and school professional) were interviewed 
about their experiences with 24-7 YouthWork and their perceptions of the programme’s 
objectives, accomplishments, and challenges. Substantive individual differences in 
participants’ perceptions of the facilitation of PYD through 24-7 were evident. However, the 
results strongly confirmed that 24-7 facilitates a number of outcomes of positive development 
through the assets associated with the youth workers, the promotion of positive adult-youth 
relationships, incorporating resources from the school and the community, opportunities for life skill development, and creating opportunities for self-determination or youth 
empowerment. The findings suggest that this approach is a feasible alternative when 
experimental evaluation approaches are not practical due to the variability commonly present 
in youth development programmes. Overall, the current study has contributed to best-practice 
youth development in New Zealand, as evidenced by the identification of a distinct PYD 
approach in 24-7 YouthWork. Further, this research has provided a platform for future 
research in this area, to use this integrated PYD programme framework in the evaluation of 
other youth development programmes.",,,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/12513",,,"en","English",,,,"University of Canterbury",,,,,,,"http://library.canterbury.ac.nz/thesis/etheses_copyright.shtml","All Rights Reserved",,,,,,,,,,,,"Exploring the implementation of Positive Youth Development in a New Zealand  youth development programme context.","Theses / Dissertations",,,,,"Health Sciences","University of Canterbury",,"Masters",,,"Master of Science",,"2348657",,,"College of Science, University of Canterbury",,"Anna.smit@pg.canterbury.ac.nz",,,,,,,,,

genetics to move away from the biomedical approach to a holistic nursing model.  
An identified gap in the literature related to no knowledge of how nurses engage in the

From the focus group four prominent themes emerged:  senses of blame and responsibility; 
conversation content; the registered nurses role; and most prominently, feelings of being 
inadequately prepared, educated, or trained to meet the expected role. This dissertation calls for 
two primary actions; that the education and discussion of genetics move away from the borrowed

development of young males’ character. Aside from a small number of studies, there
appears to be a scarcity of research concerning the historical and sociocultural influences
on pedagogies in Japanese high school rugby, and a similar sentiment could be made
regarding New Zealand secondary school rugby contexts. Accordingly, the question
guiding this research asked: What are the historical and sociocultural influences on
pedagogical approaches in rugby from the perspectives of secondary school coaches and
players in Japan and New Zealand?
Conversations with four Japanese coaches and their players, five New Zealand
coaches and their players, and researcher experiences as a bilingual athlete and coach
were the main sources of data. A hermeneutic methodology, which seeks to understand
and interpret, rather than explain and verify, was used in analysis. Vygotsky’s
sociocultural theory acts as a complimentary theoretical framework from which to make
hermeneutic interpretations of the conversations with participants from each context. The
mutual influences of historical, social, cultural, and individual factors on learning,
development and a person’s vantage point (perspective) are underscored.
Analysis utilised the whole-part-whole process of the hermeneutic circle, and
revealed that the Japanese data highlighted the sociocultural influence of seishin ideology
as an underpinning part of coaching practices. In a (bukatsudō) setting that often requires
players to attend training up to six or seven days per week, it was suggested that the
seishin ideology – aimed at the kitae (forging) of players’ kokoro (mind/spirit) and bodies
– reinforced the encouragement of varying kinds of kimochi (feeling/attitude/vitality);
and the objective of ningen keisei (character development or human cultivation). Findings
were considered in light of Yuasa’s (1987) idea of Eastern understandings of harsh
corporeal practices as a means to cultivate an achieved unity of body and mind. Further,
the historical influence of budō (the Martial Arts) was also considered (Inoue, 1997).
Pedagogy in Japan was characterized as coach centred and was framed as a Bushidō
coach approach (Miller, 2011).
Interpretation of New Zealand texts revealed a focus on developing correct
technique and skills, maintaining order in the session, and the perceived importance of
position as a teacher. Through recursive analysis using the hermeneutic circle, discussion of these findings focused on the use of control, power, and discipline in learning
environments. Interpretations drew on Mangan’s (1981) and Phillips’ (1996) suggestion
of rugby as a ‘soldier making’ pursuit; and Foucault’s (1977) and Kirk’s (1997) notion of
the ‘schooled body’ in which to understand the historical and socio-cultural influences in
the New Zealand context.
Alignment of Japanese coaches’ approaches with that of the Bushido coach
(Miller, 2011) and the emphasis placed on maintaining control by New Zealand coaches
was contrasted by data which indicated that attempts at player-centred pedagogies were
made by the Japanese and New Zealand coaches. However, interpretations made from
analysis of both coach and player data indicated that coach-centred pedagogies were still
dominant in each context.
The absence of reference to the possible educative or character developing
possibilities of participation in rugby was revealed in the New Zealand data, despite a
similar line of conversation in Japan. Discussion questioned whether this noteworthy
finding indicated that the educative intent of rugby has either shifted, or, perhaps, become
so ingrained that it operates at an implicit level in New Zealand. Notwithstanding, if
indeed educative intentions were implicit and inherent in the New Zealand secondary
school rugby context, what were the implications of leaving these objectives
unarticulated? Further, what is the role of rugby in schools, if no clear educative intent is
evident? These questions offer important direction for future research.",,,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/12547",,,"en","English",,,,"University of Canterbury",,,,,,,"http://library.canterbury.ac.nz/thesis/etheses_copyright.shtml","All Rights Reserved",,,,,,,,,,,,"Seishin and Power: The Historical and Sociocultural Influences on Rugby Coach Pedagogy in Japanese and New Zealand Secondary Schools","Theses / Dissertations",,,,,"Education","University of Canterbury",,"Doctoral",,,"Doctor of Philosophy",,"2349057",,,"College of Education, Health and Human Development, University of Canterbury",,"Blake.bennett@pg.canterbury.ac.nz",,,,,,,,,"Professor Ian Culpan"
"15098","10092/806",,,,"Genet, Raymond M.",,,,,,,"2016",,,"E.O.Wilson’s notion of consilience is the interpretation of cultural expression and human behaviour as biological phenomena. In this thesis I have undertaken to use consilience as means to meet the requirements of Principle of Coherence in the Learning Area of Learning Languages in The New Zealand Curriculum. I did this through a problem posing approach and applied it to the classroom in the form of activities that have overlap with task based and integrative learning. I created a unit of work that was designed to incite students to consider and discuss E.O.Wilson’s consilient view of aspects of human behaviour and culture as it pertains to the New Zealand environment in the target language of French. The evidence that the students had learned the subject content in a manner that used consilience to underpin the learning was a 2 minute French language podcast for a specialist website that caters for French travellers to New Zealand.
Twelve lessons were observed, recorded, and transcribed, and extracts transcribed and analysed using conversation analysis. I used an interpretive, naturalistic approach to make sense of specific conversations and how they contributed to students’ learning. I focused on two students named Learner 4 (L4) and Learner 5 (L5). I traced the development of two of their ideas as evidenced through audio-recording and supported by observations, questionnaires, and teacher-researcher debrief notes.
In the analysis of student responses I used the adaptive change cycle (ACC), a model of forest ecosystem change adapted from Holling (2001) as a novel metaphorical frame to describe students’ thinking. In this way, I used consilience in the sense of congruence. I proposed that this ecological model can be used to frame student learning. This I considered was a step towards the meeting the Principle of Coherence in The New Zealand Curriculum.
The connection of the curriculum through an evolutionary world view, engagement with the arts, and the perceptions of unifying natural patterns appear to resonate with Bateson’s notion of “grace”. This establishes coherence in the curriculum that I refer to as curriculum grace.
In applying the metaphor to the instances of learning of two students there were no negative analogies. Each extract could be coherently plotted on an ACC template. The ACC metaphor appears to provide a robust framework for the learning process.
The ecological model allowed the identification of instances of conceptual change as evidenced in system collapse points that are analogous to ecosystem collapse during disturbance events. These moments usher in periods of reorganisation, renewal, growth, and senescence. This thesis contributes to the ways in which we find those moments that indicate conceptual change and consequently the moments when teachers can evaluate learning progressions and could provide appropriate feedback.
Student responses to the unit of work suggest that even though they were not willing to maintain an unprepared discussion in French on the assigned tasks, they successfully generated innovative solutions that demonstrated reflection and these resulted in prosocial actions.",,,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/12545",,,"en","English",,,,"University of Canterbury",,,,,,,"http://library.canterbury.ac.nz/thesis/etheses_copyright.shtml","All Rights Reserved",,,,,,,,,,,,"An approach to curriculum grace.","Theses / Dissertations",,,,,"Education","University of Canterbury",,"Doctoral",,,"Doctor of Philosophy",,"2348957",,,"College of Education, Health and Human Development, University of Canterbury",,"ucresearchrepository@canterbury.ac.nz",,,,,,,,,"Prof. Lindsey Conner"
"15841","10092/806",,,,"Leier, Vera Monika",,,,,,,"2016",,,"This thesis is a study about the use of social media in language learning at a tertiary level. The
social medium chosen was Facebook which was used as part of the classroom curriculum as a
way to make the German language more authentic and accessible for the students and to
incorporate the language into students’ everyday lives. The students were required to submit
short informative posts about German culture onto the Facebook-group on a regular basis.
This meaning-focused and student-driven activity afforded the students not only the ability to
communicate in the target language but also to share cultural knowledge about the German
speaking countries.

The aim of the use of Facebook-group was to connect the students of the language class in
both a virtual and offline manner and create a tighter class community.

To learn about the perspectives and practices of teacher and students using the Facebook
platform, ethnographic methods were used for data collection. Ethnographic tools, such as
semi-structured interviews, fieldnotes and participant observation, were applied over a period
of one semester, with a pilot study prior to this period. The data were analysed combining
thematic analysis (Braun & Clarke, 2006) and activity theory (Engeström, 1987) to gain a
thorough understanding of the mechanism in the Facebook-group. Activity theory helped with
focusing the ethnographic narrative. Analysis of the activity systems in operation revealed
interesting tensions between the participants (the students) and a) the tools (Facebook-group),
b) the rules (course expectations and the conventions of Facebook use), c) the community
(students, student teachers and the teacher) and d) the division of labour (power relationships
within the community).

The analysis showed that the 23 undergraduate students of the intermediate level German
class enjoyed using the Facebook platform for their learning. The students developed
relationships in the classroom, taking the opportunity to further practise their informal written
German on a social platform which greatly reduced a lot of inhibition. A drawback of the use
of Facebook was the fact that the task was part of the curriculum and therefore assessed,
although the teacher did only acknowledge the contributions and did not mark them.
However, the students were aware of the risk of making mistakes because their contributions
could be seen by everybody in class. This led to anxiety by some students who were crafting
their posts carefully and did not make use of the Facebook task to improve their spontaneous
more informal language production. The behaviour of the students in the Facebook-group
during the semester was similar to the way they would behave on a learning management site. They took care in preparing their written contributions and lacked spontaneity. After the end
of the semester a few class members continued using the Facebook-group to keep up contact
with each other. They wrote messages and posted announcements in the target language.

The role of the teacher on the Facebook-platform changed during the research period.
Initially, the teacher’s role was active as the designer of the assignment and the founder of the
Facebook-group; eventually the students took over control of the Facebook-group
administration and the teacher retreated into a more passive position. The teacher merely
observed the activities on the Facebook-group but still contributed with occasional posts and
regularly provided feedback to the posts of students. The feedback was perceived as positive
and motivating. Students enjoyed the acknowledgement when the teacher made small
corrections.

The Facebook-group as part of the language classroom was a valuable component for
community-building and provided the students with an additional opportunity to use the target
language. The use of Facebook-group can be recommended to practitioners.",,,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/13042",,,"en","English",,,,"University of Canterbury",,,,,,,"http://library.canterbury.ac.nz/thesis/etheses_copyright.shtml","All Rights Reserved",,,,,,,,"Facebook-group||authentic||German language",,,,"“just facebook me” A study of the use of Facebook in a German language course at a tertiary institution in New Zealand.","Theses / Dissertations",,,,,"Education","University of Canterbury",,"Doctoral",,,"Doctor of Philosophy",,,,,"College of Education, Health and Human Development, University of Canterbury",,"Vera.leier@canterbury.ac.nz",,,,,,,,,"Una Cunningham"
"15193","10092/806","",,,"Chesang, Jacqueline Jelagat",,,,,,,"2016",,,"Background: Ovarian cancer is an aggressive and fatal disease affecting women worldwide. Though the pathogenesis and causes of ovarian cancer have not been established, some risk factors are well known. Use of oral contraceptives and tubal ligation have been shown to be inversely associated with ovarian cancer. What has not been clearly demonstrated is the association between intimate partner vasectomy, use of intrauterine contraceptive devices, and long-acting progestogen-based contraceptives and the risk of ovarian cancer. The limited scope for early detection of this neoplasm, and poor survival despite advances in treatment, make prevention especially important.
Objectives: This study sought to investigate whether there were associations between the use of long-acting progestogen-based contraceptives, intrauterine contraceptive devices (IUDs), and vasectomy of a woman’s sexual partner, and ovarian cancer.
Methods: This was a New Zealand nationwide population-based case-control study involving women aged 35-69 years. Controls were randomly selected from the New Zealand electoral roll. Cases were women with a diagnosis of incident ovarian cancer recruited from the New Zealand Cancer Registry (NZCR) and had to be listed on the electoral roll. A postal questionnaire was used to gather information on socio-demographic characteristics, contraceptive use, and risk factors for ovarian cancer. Data were analysed using IBM Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (IBM SPSS statistics 22). Age-adjusted analyses were done using the method of Mantel and Haenszel. In multivariate analyses, binary logistic regression was used. Approval to conduct the study was obtained from the Southern Health and Disability Ethics Committee (13/STH/26) and the University of Canterbury Human Ethics Committee (HEC 2013/08).
Results: Between 1st May 2013 and 31st October, 2015, 1,903 controls were approached. Of these 1,735 were eligible for the study and 837 participated in the study (response proportion of 48.2%). Of the 837 participants, after reviewing the questionnaires, 91 were excluded because they had prior history of bilateral oophorectomy or ovarian cancer, or were more than 69 years of age. In the same period, 258 cases were received from NZCR out of whom 205 were eligible and 152 took part (response proportion of 74.1%). Ever-use of vasectomy was inversely associated with ovarian cancer (OR = 0.67; 95% CI = 0.46-0.96). Each year of use was associated with an OR of 0.97 (95% CI = 0.94-1.00). Ever-use of DMPA was associated with an OR of 0.70 (95% CI = 0.38-1.30). Age at first use, duration of use, and time since last use of DMPA were not statistically significantly associated with ovarian cancer. Although ever-use of IUDs was not associated with ovarian cancer (OR = 0.98; 95% CI = 0.66-1.47), longer duration of use was associated with higher risk (P-trend = 0.030) and longer time since last use was inversely associated with ovarian cancer (P-trend = 0.032). There were also statistically significant inverse associations between ovarian cancer and use of oral contraceptives, parity, and breastfeeding.
Conclusion: The findings of this study suggest that ovarian cancer may be inversely associated with use of DMPA and partner vasectomy and positively associated with use of intrauterine contraceptive devices. However, these findings are not definitive; a study with greater power, or a collaborative analysis of existing studies, is needed to better assess these associations.",,,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/12603",,,"en","English",,,,"University of Canterbury",,,,,,,"http://library.canterbury.ac.nz/thesis/etheses_copyright.shtml","All Rights Reserved",,,,,,,,,,,,"Association of intimate partner vasectomy, use of long-acting progestogen-based contraceptives and intra-uterine contraceptive devices with risk of ovarian cancer.","Theses / Dissertations",,,,,"Health Sciences","University of Canterbury",,"Doctoral",,,"Doctor of Philosophy",,"2363044",,,"College of Education, Health and Human Development, University of Canterbury",,"jacquelinechesang@gmail.com",,,,,,,,,"Professor Ann Richardson"

Despite this, international literature has identified a lack of implementation of non-pharmacological methods in practice. Following an extensive review of relevant literature, it was identified that no research on the topic of non-pharmacological methods of pain management has been conducted in New Zealand. Given this, the research question for this small pilot study was: Do New Zealand registered nurses use non-pharmacological methods of postoperative pain management for paediatric surgical patients, and if so, to what extent? Three international research papers have investigated the utilisation of non-pharmacological methods of pain management by nurses in Finland, Singapore and China through use of a questionnaire. This questionnaire was adapted for a New Zealand context and distributed to registered nurses working in a paediatric surgical ward in one district health board. Though the sample size of 16 was small, the results showed that participants were using a variety of non-pharmacological methods which correlates with international literature. These methods include distraction, repositioning, positive reinforcement, therapeutic touch, comforting/reassurance, presence, helping with daily activities, creating a comfortable environment, and more. This suggests that participating nurses are staying current with global approaches to pain management in paediatric patients. Further research into the topic of pain management in paediatric patients is recommended to expand knowledge in this area and improve clinical practice. Replicating this pilot study on a nationwide scale would provide more detailed information about New Zealand nurses’ utilisation of non-pharmacological methods of pain management and allow valid comparisons to be made with international research.

The setting is a counselling agency in Christchurch, New Zealand.

A qualitative research approach is used and the data analysed using a narrative inquiry approach. The context of this study is the counselling service of an agency where young children, adolescents and their families are helped and supported through a variety of life issues. The counselling the participants are offered uses a combination of a solution-focused and play therapy where the purpose is to encourage clients to find exceptions to their presenting problems and identify their preferred future. The aim of this study is to help the children navigate their problem through a better understanding of and the gaining of personal skills and strengths.

Participants were invited to be part of this study through the agency waiting list. The four included presented with a variety of reasons for coming to counselling yet these proved similar to that which the agency has been routinely presented with in the aftermath of the Canterbury earthquakes from 2011 to present day. Each participant had the consent of their parents or caregivers to engage in this project. The participants themselves separately agreed to engage in a solution- focused counselling process where the counsellor also integrated the use of small toys as part of the course. Counselling sessions were audiotaped, aspects photographed and analysed with a specific focus on client engagement.

Four key themes emerged as the participants explored their personal narrative. Firstly, the “I’m OK” theme depicted in their first scaling activity, secondly a recognition that things could indeed be better and they needed help. Thirdly, a realisation of their own strengths and skills and finally that the future was an optimistic place to look forward to.

These themes are described and explained through descriptions of the participant’s stories as well as self-reflection by the researcher. Transcriptions of sessions are included as are excerpts from the research journal and photographs of the use of the small toys by the children.",,,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/13547",,,"en","English",,,,"University of Canterbury",,,,,,,"http://library.canterbury.ac.nz/thesis/etheses_copyright.shtml","All Rights Reserved",,,,,,,,,,,,"Less Talk, More Action; The integration of small figures in a solution-focused counselling practice with children.",,,"Electronic Thesis or Dissertation",,,"Counselling","University of Canterbury",,"Masters",,,"Master of Counselling",,"2486698",,,"College of Education, Health and Human Development, University of Canterbury",,"karise.dell@gmail.com",,,,,,,,,"Shanee Barraclough"

The literature shows many beneficial outcomes of simulation use in the student population including an increase in confidence, improvements in psychomotor skills and also improvements in communication skills. Although in the student population simulation is well described, the benefits and outcomes of simulation in the ward environment for graduate nurses is still developing and research is particularly scarce in the New Zealand context. This study aimed to answer the question ‘What are registered nurses experiences of how in situ simulation contributes to their ongoing clinical skills?’ Three semi-structured interviews were completed from Emergency Department nurses recruited from a local institution. Thematic analysis of the interview transcripts revealed an improvement in registered nurses psychomotor skills, communication skills, clinical decision making skills and teamwork. It was also reported that realism, transparency and the feelings evoked by being involved in in situ simulation facilitated the participants’ learning. Within the reported findings the outcomes from in situ simulation included a task-management focus for less experienced nurses, transferring to a team-management approach, where nurses could focus on communication and clinical decision making skills, for nurses with more clinical experience. Although these findings were present they should be taken tentatively due to the small-scale nature of the study.

Stepfamily members, as well as the stepfamily as a whole, are faced with many unique challenges, including adapting to changes in family dynamics and routines, forming new step-relationships, and establishing solidarity within the stepfamily system. The stepparent-stepchild relationship is thought to be one of the most critical relationships to the overall functioning of the stepfamily. Yet, the involuntary nature of the relationship, the ambiguity that surrounds a stepparent’s role and boundaries, non-biological ties, and lack of shared history means the development of a positive stepparent-stepchild relationship can be one of the most difficult tasks. This study explored the effectiveness and suitability of an emotion-focused parenting programme on stepparents’ emotional parenting styles and practices, stepchildren’s behaviour, and stepparents’ overall family satisfaction. Participants were nine stepparents from around Christchurch who agreed to participate in a six-week Tuning in to Kids parenting programme, specifically adapted for stepparents. Quantitative and qualitative data were collected via pre- and post-programme questionnaires and brief phone interviews. Results from the quantitative analyses showed improvements in stepparents’ emotion regulation, emotion coaching and empathy, lower emotion dismissing, increased warmth and sensitivity, and lower over-reactivity. Stepparents also reported greater overall family satisfaction. No significant differences were found for stepparents’ lax/inconsistent discipline or stepchildren’s behaviour. Five main themes were generated from the qualitative data relating to the positive experience; increased emotional awareness, group connectedness, impact of adaptations, and identified challenges. Results are discussed in relation to a family systems perspective underlying the stepfamily literature, emotional development research, and in comparison to previously established parenting programmes. Overall, the study shows promising preliminary findings to suggest that an emotion-focused programme is a suitable and potentially effective approach for providing support to stepparents.",,,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/13058",,,"en","English",,,,"University of Canterbury",,,,,,,"http://library.canterbury.ac.nz/thesis/etheses_copyright.shtml","All Rights Reserved",,,,,,,,,,,,"Tuning in to kids : evaluating an emotion-coaching parenting programme among stepfamilies.","Theses / Dissertations",,,,,"Health Sciences","University of Canterbury",,"Masters",,,"Master of Science",,"2406644",,,"College of Education, Health and Human Development, University of Canterbury",,"kategoonan@gmail.com",,,,,,,,,"Dr Myron Friesen"

"15218","10092/806",,,,"Donaldson, Keren",,,,,,,"2016",,,"Recent New Zealand demographic data has indicated a continuing trend towards secularisation in this country, with more individuals unaffiliated with any religious organisations than ever before. Nevertheless, approximately 49% of New Zealanders still identify with a Christian faith (including Catholic, traditional and non-traditional protestant denominations), and a growing minority (3.5%) identify with one of the other major religions (e.g., Islam, Hinduism, Sikhism; Statistics New Zealand, 2014). In spite of this large proportion of New Zealanders that profess some type of religious affiliation and a strong history of religious beliefs for both Māori and New Zealand Europeans, there has been very little research from New Zealand regarding the development of spirituality and religiosity in young people.
The aim of this study was to explore this question in a group of 87 religiously affiliated young people (aged 16-21) and a subsample of 12 interview participants through an embedded mixed methods study. The research questions examined the distinctions between “religiosity” and “spirituality”, the factors that young adults perceive as influencing the development of their faith identity and spirituality, and the associations between faith identity, religiosity and spirituality, religious motivation, social connectedness, demographic factors, and three indicators of mental health (psychological well-being, anxiety, and depression).
The quantitative analyses showed that faith identities characterised by higher diffusion (disengagement with faith) and moratorium (exploration/doubt) predicted lower spirituality and religiosity; whilst intrinsic reasons for church attendance predicted higher spirituality and religiosity. Levels of psychological well-being and anxiety were predicted by spirituality (but not religiosity), moratorium faith identity, and relational quality with parents and peers. The negative association between spirituality and anxiety was mediated by higher moratorium faith identity. Finally, symptoms of depression were only predicted by relational quality with parents and peers, and connectedness to community. The qualitative analyses revealed that spirituality and religiosity were considered to be different concepts, distinguished by associations with the individual and the institution respectively. The interview participants believed their spiritual development to be largely influenced by their parents and mentors, interacting with their church community and participating in church activities more frequently than just Sundays, as well as having a personal connection to God.
The results revealed contrasts between the two types of analyses, whereby higher questioning and exploration was associated with lower spirituality in the quantitative analyses, but in the interviews, the young people believed questioning faith to be a positive influence on spiritual development. These findings are discussed from the perspectives of identity development, stages of faith development, as well as in terms of the methodology of the study. Further, the associations between mental health and social connectedness add to the discussion whereby the impact of moratorium on spirituality and mental health may be influenced by the social environments and church settings in which young people practice their faith and spirituality.",,,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/12665",,,"en","English",,,,"University of Canterbury",,,,,,,"http://library.canterbury.ac.nz/thesis/etheses_copyright.shtml","All Rights Reserved",,,,,,,,,,,,"The faith dimension : a mixed methods study about spirituality and religion in New Zealand young people.","Theses / Dissertations",,,,,"Health Sciences","University of Canterbury",,"Masters",,,"Master of Arts",,"2365503",,,"College of Education, Health and Human Development, University of Canterbury",,"keren_happuch87@hotmail.com",,,,,,,,,"Dr Myron Friesen"
"15217","10092/806",,,,"Carroll, Jane Lyndsey Drummond",,,,,,,"2016",,,"International research into literacy acquisition makes evident that the large inequity of literacy outcomes, even in wealthy countries, continues, despite heavy investment in raising achievement for all children (United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation—UNESCO, 2009; United Nations Children’s Fund—UNICEF, 2010). There are a number of different approaches that incorporate key predictors of literacy that have been considered, and programs implemented to attempt to raise literacy levels and reduce inequality. Phonological Awareness (PA) has been recognised as one of the underlying constructs for literacy success and PA is one of the most powerful predictors of early literacy (Al Otaiba, Kosanovich, & Torgesen, 2012; Castles & Coltheart, 2004; Pressley, 2006; Yopp & Yopp, 2000).
Evidence of the benefits of PA to literacy development has been well documented within controlled outside of the classroom environment research settings (Ehri et al., 2001; Gillon, 2005a; McNeill, Gillon, & Dodd, 2009b). There have been PA approaches that have been implemented into classroom literacy practices (Ball, 1997; Carson, Gillon, & Boustead, 2013) and a large number of websites that teachers can access for information on assessing PA and classroom resources. However, there is less known about practices in early childhood or education settings, and whether teachers’ underlying knowledge, and skills, can appropriately support effective integration of PA into typical literacy programs during early childhood and early school years. For this reason, five investigations of teacher knowledge and practices that may support children’s phonological awareness development are reported in this thesis.
The first study (reported in Chapter 2) examined the use of a phonological awareness test to assess the phonological awareness skills of 699 education professionals and paraprofessionals working in New Zealand primary schools and early childhood centres. Performance in a phonological awareness test was compared across speech-language therapists (SLTs, n = 34), primary school teachers (n = 208), teacher aides (n = 49), Resource Teachers of Literacy (RTLits, n = 80), Resource Teachers of Learning and Behaviour (RTLBs, n = 26), early childhood teachers (ECTs, n = 51), third year College of Education students (3YRBT, n = 98), and first year College of Education students (1YRBT, n =153). The results indicated that the Phonological Awareness Test had construct validity and that there was large variability in New Zealand educators’ capacity to segment words into sounds. SLTs performed at near ceiling (98% accuracy), whereas junior school teachers performed at 74% accuracy, teacher aides at 63%, ECTs at 56%, RTLits at 89%, RTLBs at 78%, third year College of Education students at 68%, and first year College of Education students at 55%. The data suggest that professional development in phonological awareness for all the educators, as well as pre-service teachers and teacher aides, is warranted.
In New Zealand, there is a national early childhood curriculum, Te Whāriki: he whāriki matauranga mō ngā mokopuna o Aotearoa: Early childhood curriculum (MOE., 1996b), that is based on a social-constructionism theoretical framework and as such, is a broad but non-prescriptive curriculum. The second study (reported in Chapter 3) investigated the typical storybook reading practices of ten early childhood teachers reading to small groups of four-year-old children. Teachers’ comments and discussion as they shared the storybooks with the children were transcribed and coded to describe the types of comments teachers make and the extent to which their comments target emergent literacy skills. Two research questions were asked: (1) What are the levels of cognitive demand prompted by teachers’ questions and comments? (2) What are the foci of the questions and comments made during story reading?
The results showed that the early childhood teachers predominantly focused on story content and meaning, with significantly fewer comments that drew children’s attention to the print on the page or emphasised developing early phonological awareness skills important to word reading. A child’s phonological awareness (PA) ability at school entry can reliably predict their early literacy success. Yet there is little evidence of the PA content knowledge that early childhood (EC) teachers have, and how they may use this knowledge to facilitate children’s PA development within early childhood centres.
The third study (reported in Chapter 4) examined the PA knowledge of forty-three qualified early childhood teachers over time, in both verbal and written contexts and explored the effect of two professional development models on enhancing teachers' PA knowledge. At the beginning of the nine-week baseline phase, all teachers were asked to complete a questionnaire and were then assessed at four time points using two forms of a PA test (two verbal and two written test formats). At week nine, the early childhood centres and their teachers were randomly assigned to one of two conditions: professional development plus coaching (PD+C) or professional development only (PDOnly). Two centres, whose teaching staff were unable to access the PD, acted as a Control group. The PD+C and PDOnly groups participated in a 90-minute professional development session focusing on PA and enhancing emergent literacy skills during storybook reading. In addition, The PD+C group received four individualised coaching sessions to facilitate increased use of PA within their teaching context. Teachers in the PD+C and Control groups were videoed during a typical storybook session with a small group of children.
The teachers’ ability to correctly define PA compared to phonics was very low. PA total scores were consistent across the baseline phase but subtest results suggest high variability when comparing the individual items. There were differences in scores between verbal and written presentations of the same test version. At post- intervention, teachers in the PA+C and PDOnly groups’ PA scores increased compared to the Control group. These results have implications for early childhood teaching. Incorporating PA into the curriculum in more explicit activities, and professional development models will be discussed.
The fourth study (reported in Chapter 5) explored the PA knowledge of primary school teachers over time. At the beginning of the nine-week research phase, all teachers were asked to complete a questionnaire and were then assessed at four time points using two forms of a PA test (two verbal and two written test formats). Unlike their EC colleagues, this group of forty-four registered teachers showed no difference in scores between verbal and written presentations of the same test version and no differences over time for their total PA test scores. On the Teachers Beliefs About Literacy Questionnaire (TBALQ) (Westwood, Knight, & Redden, 1997) there was a preference shown by the teachers for a balanced literacy instructional program.
The fifth study (reported in Chapter 6) explored the classroom implementation over time of two interventions. The first after a baseline-monitoring period of nine-weeks, was a professional development session with a teacher (teacher A). The children in teacher A’s class PA skills were monitored and growth trajectories plotted. After eleven-weeks there were PA classroom resources introduced into teacher A’s literacy teaching program, the lead researcher coached teacher A to implement explicit PA instruction that was linked into teacher A’s literacy program (e.g., initial and final sound sorting game of the letter that the teacher focused on in the printing lesson). Teacher A and the lead researcher further developed the resources. After the ten-week period, teacher A had completed nineteen-hours of explicit PA teaching and the children’s PA trajectories were plotted. There was a greater increase in PA learning over the ten-week period when the resources and coaching were implemented than the eleven-week period after teacher A had received PD alone. Implications for classroom teacher implementation of explicit PA instruction in the first year of school are discussed.
The results from this thesis provide evidence that early childhood teachers and primary school teachers and other professionals associated with developing children’s literacy skills have wide and varying metalinguistic knowledge, understanding, and use of phonological awareness in their work with children. The level of this knowledge varies significantly with the participants’ level of specialist training; and also within subgroups of educators. However, studies within the thesis demonstrate that teachers’ knowledge can be successfully enhanced through professional development and individualised coaching. The results also demonstrate that PA implementation at early childhood through storybook reading, and whole class based implemented PA instruction, alongside increased teacher knowledge and pedagogy, can support improved literacy success for young children. Overall, the thesis findings have important implications for the preparation and professional development of teachers working to enhance children’s early literacy development.",,,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/12664",,,"en","English",,,,"University of Canterbury",,,,,,,"http://library.canterbury.ac.nz/thesis/etheses_copyright.shtml","All Rights Reserved",,,,,,,,,,,,"Oral language and literacy : teachers’ phonological awareness knowledge and effective classroom practices.","Theses / Dissertations",,,,,"Education","University of Canterbury",,"Doctoral",,,"Doctor of Philosophy",,"2365504",,,"College of Education, Health and Human Development, University of Canterbury",,"jane@saltnz.org",,,,,,,,,"Professor Gail Gillon"

The research involved a total of 106 participants, in three separate studies over a

achievement data was gathered before, midway and following the interventions. The first two
studies involved standardised testing measures, while the third study included tests

Study Two, comprising four treatment groups, included a control intervention in
which matched students were provided with typical teaching methods used in the classrooms
of the schools where the studies were conducted. The other three groups received either a

from Study Two. The groups received either the Phonemic Awareness programme or the
combination of the Phonemic Awareness and Dialectal Awareness programme.
All three studies produced positive results with regard to improvements in the
participants’ literacy levels compared to normal classroom teaching. However, comparisons with the Phonemic Awareness training intervention were mixed. Overall, participants who
received focused Dialectal Awareness strategies as part of their interventions showed similar
improvements in reading of connected text, spelling, Phonemic Awareness, Writing and the
ability to ‘code-switch’ in oral contexts, to those who had received the Phoneme based

"15924","10092/806",,,"Smith, B. J.",,,,,,,,"2016",,,"Background
Disengagement is the active avoidance of a group or situation. Patient disengagement is an ongoing problem for health services and governments, as it reduces efficiency, generates additional financial costs, and reduces early identification and management of health problems. Patients who frequently disengage from preventive care services often require secondary care.
Patient disengagement is an ongoing issue for oral health services. Cost, past experience, perceptions, and accessibility are key determinants to oral health service disengagement. Moreover, child disengagement is likely to follow into adolescence and adulthood. However, oral health disengagement is under researched, and what research has been conducted, predominately utilises quantitative methods. These methods identify disengagement characteristics, including who, when and how often, but fails to uncover why patients disengage from oral health services. In contrast, qualitative research methods usefully augment the current evidence-base by providing rich insights into disengagement rationalisation.
Disengagement is often the result of a combination of complex circumstances occurring in a patient’s life. These complexities make disengagement difficult to clearly define. However, appointment failure is considered as one important component of disengagement, and for the purpose of this research, was used as a proxy measure of disengagement.
The study investigates appointment failure at the Canterbury District Health Board’s (CDHB) Community Dental Service (CDS). The CDS is a preventative dental service providing free dental care for eligible children between the age of 6 months to 13 years, in Canterbury and South Canterbury.
Objectives
Set with the Canterbury District Health Board’s (CDHB) Community Dental Service (CDS), the primary research objectives are to identify the characteristics of pre-schooler appointment failure, identify the frequency of appointment failure per Community Dental Clinic (CDC), and discover parent and caregiver reasons for disengagement and their recommendations to the CDS to ameliorate it.
Methods
The study was granted ethics approval from the CDHB research office and the University of Canterbury (UC), Human Ethics Committee.
A mixed methods sequential research design was employed to meet the research objectives. Phase one, a quantitative epidemiological investigation, utilised a retrospective closed cohort of eligible CDHB CDS pre-schoolers born in 2010 and their 2010-2014 appointment history. Eligibility required pre-schoolers to be enrolled with the CDS for the duration of the study period. A descriptive and analytical epidemiological approach was taken to characterise the population and factors associated with appointment failure.
Phase two, the qualitative component, involved undertaking two parent and caregiver focus groups. Focus group participants were recruited from CDS clinic locations identified as having high failure rates in Phase one. To be eligible for the focus group, parents and caregivers had to have at least one pre-schooler currently enrolled in the CDS, who had missed a minimum of two appointments. Focus group transcripts were transcribed and analysed to uncover the factors that influence appointment failure.
Results
Overall, in Phase one, 6,986 pre-schoolers were born in 2010 and eligible for CDS enrolment. Male pre-schoolers accounted for 50.4% of the study population, while females made up 49.6%. The majority of pre-schoolers were European (77.6%), followed by Māori, Asian, Pacific Islands and Other, 9.2%, 7.7%, 3.9% and 1.6% respectively. Of the total number of pre-schoolers, 49.8% were living in the least deprived areas (quintiles one and two), 19.3% were living in moderate deprivation areas (quintile three) and 30.9% were living in the most deprived areas (quintiles four and five).
Of the 18,933 scheduled appointments, 12.3% ended in appointment failure. The odds of failing an appointment were significantly greater for pre-schoolers with a Māori or Pacific Islands ethnicity (4.3 and 4.8 respectively), living in high deprivation areas (3.0 and 5.6 respectively), or aged 3 or 4 years at their scheduled appointment (0.6 and 0.5 respectively). Appointment type and pre-schooler sex did not increase the odds of failing an appointment.
In Phase two, focus group participants identified four factors that influence appointment failure: waiting room and dental surgery ambience, staff attitude, physical resources that inhibit accessibility, and communicating with technology. Participants did not associate their childhood and current dental anxiety and fear with their pre-schooler’s failed appointments. Participants made several recommendations to reduce future appointment failure; these recommendations ranged in implementation difficulty. Seemingly simple recommendations involved enhancing the clinic environment, issuing parents with fridge magnets with the services contact details, and clinical staff communication. Potentially more difficult recommendations involved changing the clinic hours to offer late night and weekend appointments, and changing the services care delivery model so pre-schoolers can be screened in CDS mobile dental vans instead of CDC’s.
Conclusions
Consistent with New Zealand oral health literature, Māori and Pacific Islands pre-schoolers, pre-schoolers living in high deprivation areas and pre-schoolers aged 3 or 4 experienced greater odds of failing an appointment at the CDS. However, unique to New Zealand oral health disengagement literature, four factors were identified by participants as influencing their pre-schoolers appointment failure. These factors did not include a participant’s own childhood dental perceptions and experiences as influencing their pre-schoolers failed appointments; a factor considered to be a barrier in the international literature.
The strengths of the research were the selected research methods and analysis. The mixed methods approach brought an innovative complementary perspective to an important but poorly understood topic. The opportunity to use a large, prospectively collected database systematically captured from a reliable patient data information system to inform strengths based focus groups, was also important. Talking to parents and caregivers and uncovering the reasons for non-attendance provided fresh insight, outside the routinely collected quantitative variables, and is another salient strength of this study.
The research findings demonstrate the complexity and intricacies of pre-school appointment failure. Furthermore, there are clear cultural, socio-economic and age disparities associated with CDS disengagement. The CDS needs to address these disparities by targeting and promoting a service that will best meet the needs of vulnerable parents and caregivers. To improve utilisation for vulnerable pre-schoolers, the CDS should begin by incorporating the recommendations made by participants into the services model of care and future service development.",,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/13165",,,,"en","English",,,,"University of Canterbury",,,,,,,"http://library.canterbury.ac.nz/thesis/etheses_copyright.shtml","All Rights Reserved",,,,,,,,,,,,"Understanding pre-school children’s Community Dental Service appointment failure: a mixed-methods study","Theses / Dissertations",,,,,"Health Sciences","University of Canterbury",,"Masters",,,"Master of Health Sciences",,"2409745",,,"College of Education, Health and Human Development, University of Canterbury",,"-",,,,,,,,,"Professor Philip Schulter"

It used qualitative research with an interpretivist, or phenomenological approach, recognising the need for a subjective dimension that values the perspectives of children in context. It focused on six students who identified with some of the characteristics commonly associated with introversion, such as a preference to reflect and think before they speak or act, an aversion to over-stimulating situations, and a preference to work alone or in small groups with familiar people. Another group of seventeen non-focus students provided their own perspectives. Semi-structured interviews were used to record the lived experiences of the participants and explore how they perceive these experiences.
The study revealed some incompatibilities in the way different personalities operate in the classroom, particularly in group settings, and it raised questions about the need to use cooperative learning techniques. Some students expressed frustration with dominating behaviours in groups, arguing, and high noise levels. They may feel stressed by expectations to process ideas quickly when giving a response, and they often prefer to work alone or with selected group members. These factors sometimes exclude them from participating fully as class members. The findings affirmed the importance of teachers listening to student voice, understanding the diverse needs of their students, and actively creating conditions, adaptations and options that promote inclusion and wellbeing.
The Ministry of Education requires New Zealand schools to be “inclusive” of all students, removing barriers to learning, and promoting wellbeing. The present policy acknowledges diversity, recognises that learning needs are not specific to certain conditions, and calls on teachers to know and respond to their students’ needs. While numerous studies suggest that the majority of students achieve more and enjoy their learning more when working in collaborative or cooperative groups, this is not always the case.",,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/13074",,,,"en","English",,,,"University of Canterbury",,,,,,,"http://library.canterbury.ac.nz/thesis/etheses_copyright.shtml","All Rights Reserved",,,,,,,,,,,,"Listening to their silence : the learning experiences of quiet students in a middle school environment.","Theses / Dissertations",,,,,"Education","University of Canterbury",,"Masters",,,"Master of Education",,"2406652",,,"College of Education, Health and Human Development, University of Canterbury",,"helen.moran@tawaint.school.nz",,,,,,,,,"Dr Veronica O’Toole"
"15898","10092/806",,,,"Ahmed, Mazharuddin Syed",,,,,,,"2016",,,"Smartphones today are ubiquitous and are influencing our everyday life and have unsettled
many age-old tasks, activities, devices, gadgets, tools and technologies with their redefined
usage and definitions. They have relatively strong computing capabilities built into small
sizes that offer versatile communication possibilities and are equipped with intuitive
operating systems, smart sensors and applications. They have a great potential to be used
as learning devices owing to their connectivity and versatility to suit various learning
styles and learner preferences. The understanding of parameters which govern the
customised integration of smartphones is the key to a successful acceptance and
assimilation of these devices as learning tools.
Technology acceptance models are used in studies aimed at predicting and explaining the
user’s behaviour towards the acceptance and usage of new technologies. This study
adopted the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT2) model
along with educational context, gender and educational level as moderators. This study at
the outset hypothesised that the educational context plays a key role as a moderator in the
acceptance of smartphones as learning tools and hence will influence the variables in the
UTAUT2 model. Context based mobile learning also assures learners that learning content
can be matched, adapted or selected according to their current learning situation and
contextual educational environment.
To understand smartphone technology integration, this research compared the two context
groups, one from the College of Engineering (CX1) and the other from the College of
Education (CX2), both from the same university cohort. They were chosen according to
the contrasting differences in their programs, curriculum, pedagogy, student aptitudes and
required skills. The two groups were sampled from a university in New Zealand. This
research terms these two groups as two different “contexts” of education.
The survey instrument was designed and developed after conducting Pilot studies. The
final survey questionnaire was distributed and about 310 were collected from the
university students. This study then adopted a two-step confirmatory factor analysis technique. In the first step, it extracted the best items using the Principal Component
Analysis factor extraction method. In the second stage, the structure model was developed
to assess the four set hypotheses of this research.
The results from the data analysis of this research strongly confirm the influence of
educational context as a moderator in the acceptance of smartphones as mobile learning
tools. The major contributions of this research are that the UTAUT2 model was found to
be a significant predictor of the student's behaviour intention to use smartphones as mobile
learning tools. The other key contribution of this research was redefining the two original
UTAUT2 constructs, Social Influence and Facilitating Conditions. The Social Influence
construct was redefined as the influence of peers, classmates and teaching faculty to use
smartphones for learning. Facilitating Conditions was redefined as receiving educational
help and support through smartphone connectivity and communication.
Researchers typically assess the effect of moderators on technology acceptance by
considering effects across disciplines/courses. This research focussed on multilevel
moderator comparisons (inter and intra groups) to assess the effects of the educational
context moderator on acceptance, current models of predictors of acceptance and the
moderating influences of gender and educational level. Such inter and intra comparisons
should inform our understanding of how a highly personalised device such as the
smartphone can be integrated contextually for students as a learning tool. The findings
highlight the potential factors that may enable the acceptance of smartphone-based mobile
learning within a university environment.",,,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/13096",,,"en","English",,,,"University of Canterbury",,,,,,,"http://library.canterbury.ac.nz/thesis/etheses_copyright.shtml","All Rights Reserved",,,,,,,,,,,,"Technology acceptance of smartphones as mobile learning tools: a contextual comparative study of engineering and education colleges","Theses / Dissertations",,,,,"Education","University of Canterbury",,"Doctoral",,,"Doctor of Philosophy",,"2406961",,,"College of Education, Health and Human Development, University of Canterbury",,"mazharmail@gmail.com",,,,,,,,,"Professor John Everett"

Increasing the visibility of te reo Māori in New Zealand is a national policy, to honour the Treaty of Waitangi and to contribute to the revitalisation and normalisation of the threatened language. Early childhood education is viewed as one of the cornerstones of the revitalisation of te reo Māori in New Zealand, therefore the visibility of te reo Māori in an early childhood centre is of significance to study. This research was conducted in an award-winning Māori immersion early childhood centre and included the environments of the centre, the home and online, creating a language ecology. The aim was to describe and understand the policies and practices of language and technology use in each environment, and then to understand how those environments interacted. Photos were taken of the displays and semi-structured interviews were conducted with the Head of Centre, teachers and parents. The findings showed that the linguistic landscape served a greater function than just indicating vitality, policy and use. There were unseen processes that were occurring, aimed at strengthening wellbeing, achievement, togetherness, tikanga, normalisation, identity, and belonging.

It has become a strategy that schools can use to provide 21st century learning opportunities for students without having to provide school-­‐owned devices. This study raises important questions for teachers and schools to ask themselves before implementing BYOD.

This study explores the experiences of three New Zealand primary school teachers as they introduce BYOD into their classrooms. The case study sought to understand what factors impacted on their ability to implement new pedagogical practices and how professional learning might help support teachers with BYOD.

The literature review examines national and international literature on the implementation and impact of BYOD. It discusses how and why teachers do or do not engage with ICT in classrooms and how BYOD impacts on their practice. This case study utilises SAMR (Puentedura, 2006) and TPACK (Mishra & Koehler, 2006) in order to analyse the data and discuss the findings. The findings suggest that, in order for teachers to maximise the potential of BYOD, professional learning and technical support is essential. The teachers experienced a number of challenges as they introduced BYOD, yet all managed to persevere and remain positive as they trialled new teaching methods, and utilised new programs and applications.

The study concludes by making a number of pertinent recommendations that can be actioned by schools in order to ensure implementation is smooth and successful.

students in Pakistan. The specific factors selected for investigation were fathers warmth, 
extraversion vs. introversion, self-esteem, and peer relationships.  Two demographic factors, 
gender and socio-economic status (based on parental income), were also examined to determine 
potential relationships with mental health problems. 

A quantitative research design was utilized and data were obtained through participants 
completing five different standardized surveys.  The participants were 314 undergraduate 
students from different departments, attending one university in Karachi. The age of 
participants ranged from 18 to 24 years, and 149 were female and 165 were male.

The findings of this study revealed a positive correlation between extraversion and 
mental health, fathers warmth and mental health, and self-esteem and mental health, along 
with significant gender differences: male students reported more positive mental health levels 
than female students. There was also a trend for those students from the lowest parental income 
category to report lower mental health levels. Additionally, of the factors assessed, fathers 
warmth predicted most variabilityin mental health scores.

These findings provide insights into students perception of their mental health and 
factors that maybe related to these self-reports. Such work highlights the importance of raising 
awareness of mental health among university students, their families, and university 
administration, particularly in cultures where these is potentially less acceptance of mental 
health problems.  The findings should support the planning and development of effective 
interventions and strategies, not only for university students experiencing mental health 
problems, but also universityadministration: the influence of fathers warmth on mental health

consequently, it is striving to achieve intergenerational transmission within a dominant 
English speaking society. This thesis focuses on the relationship between language and 
identity and the historical and contemporary contexts that have shaped the lives of eight 
iwi Māori participants and their children, who are living in the realities of this situation.  
When interviewed, these participants all had children aged between 0 and 5 years and all 
understood the importance of te reo Māori intergenerational transmission. This thesis seeks 
to answer the following broad research question: “What emerges from the narratives as 
Māori parents seek to revitalise Māori language with their children?” Using a Kaupapa 
Māori theoretical approach and an Indigenous narrative inquiry method, parents’ narratives 
were gathered and emerging themes were formed from these. Using Benham’s (2007) 
Indigenous narrative framework for analysis, these emerging themes were first placed into 
three features: ecological, sociocultural, and institutional. These three features were then 
scanned for the interrelationships across all three features and further analysed to thereby 
create a fourth feature, interrelationships. The key findings from this research are that 
intergenerational te reo Māori is not only about passing on language: it is also about 
healing intergenerational historical trauma, racial assumptions and stereotypes, which all 
arise from the legacy of colonisation. These aspects need to be addressed as part of 
developing both reo Māori communities of support and cultural and spiritual wellbeing so 
whānau can develop resistant and resilient language identities for living in a contemporary 
world.  Due to high language loss in Ngāi Tahu tribal region (located in the South Island), 
succession planning is required at all language levels. Rather than relying on institutional 
knowledge, it is te reo Māori relationships and mentoring systems that will sustain and encourage the use of te reo Māori. This research shows that whānau living the reality of 
being Māori/English bilinguals have followed a pathway handed down from their 
ancestors: a pathway which has created a new dynamic way to be bilingual in a 
contemporary world. The unique contribution of this thesis is to present this pathway in a 
new model based on these participants’ narratives.  This model demonstrates the key roles 
of whakapapa and rangatiratanga in establishing normalisation of te reo Māori in the home, 
hapū, iwi, community and civic society. Parents’ experiences and knowledges are valuable 
as they have led the way in language revitalisation. It is hoped that these research findings

been researched with English first language/monolingual cohorts (see Cain, Oakhill, Barnes, & 
Bryant, 2001; Oakhill & Cain, 2012; Silva & Cain, 2015), there is a paucity of research on 
inferential skills in other languages as well as in bilinguals or second language learning contexts. 
Therefore, the present study focused on investigating inferential skills and reading 
comprehension in two different languages (Thai and English) within the same group of adult 
students at a college in Thailand. The primary objectives of this study, as reported in this thesis, 
were to examine the reciprocal relationships of inferential skills within Thai and English, and to 
investigate whether inferential skills can predict reading comprehension both within each 
language and across languages (Thai-L1 and English-L2). 
The study involved measures of inferential skills, reading comprehension, vocabulary 
and listening comprehension in Thai and English, following appropriate adaptation, piloting and 
revision. Raven’s Advanced Progressive Matrices test (short form) was also used to explore non
verbal reasoning, and a questionnaire was used to provide background details about the participants 
and their views on reading comprehension strategies. Data collection was conducted at one 
campus of a university in Thailand. All ten measures were administered to a group of 220 Thai

 The results demonstrated a significant inter-relationship between inferential skills in Thai 
(L1) and English (L2). Scores on the inferential tasks were also related to reading comprehension 
within the same language. Furthermore, the findings from hierarchical regression analyses 
indicated that the addition of inferential skill scores significantly increased the predictability of reading comprehension in the same language, after controlling for within-language vocabulary 
levels (and listening comprehension in the case of Thai) and non-verbal reasoning. Analyses 
across languages showed positive correlations between Thai inferential skills and English 
reading comprehension, and between English inferential skills and Thai reading comprehension. 
Hierarchical regression analyses indicated that the addition of English inferential skills scores 
predicted extra variability in Thai reading comprehension, after controlling for English and Thai 
language related skills and non-verbal reasoning measures, but the addition of Thai inferential 
skills scores did not influence the level of prediction of English reading comprehension after 
controlling for the same variables. The reading strategies questionnaire did not reveal a 
significant relationship with either the Thai or the English reading comprehension scores. 
However, relationships between self-reported reading comprehension strategies and inferential 
skills scores were found, though the correlations were relatively small.  
Overall, the findings are consistent with the ability to make inferences being an important 
component of successful text comprehension–although there is little evidence of awareness 
influencing performance among the current participants. The influence of inference making does 
not seem to be explained by more general language skills (such as vocabulary and listening 
comprehension), nor by more general (non-verbal) reasoning skills, and it has the potential to 
occur across languages (from English to Thai in the present study), although within language 
influences may be larger than between languages. These findings have both theoretical and 
practical implications, which are discussed in this thesis.",,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/13289",,,,"en","English",,,,"University of Canterbury",,,,,,,"http://library.canterbury.ac.nz/thesis/etheses_copyright.shtml","All Rights Reserved",,,,,,,,,,,,"Influence of inferential skills on the reading comprehension ability of adult Thai (L1) and English (L2) students.","Theses / Dissertations",,,,,,"University of Canterbury",,"Doctoral",,,"Doctor of Philosophy",,,,,"College of Education, Health and Human Development, University of Canterbury",,"pawadees@yahoo.com",,,,,,,,,"Professor John Everatt"

mental health among Zimbabwe immigrants of African origin living in New Zealand.
Acculturation has been shown to be linked directly with immigration outcomes, and
also with different motives for migration. Having been born in Zimbabwe and being
an ethnic black Zimbabwean who arrived in New Zealand on or after 2000 are the
inclusion criteria. The participant should have attained the age of 18 years by
the date they migrated. As part of consultation, key informant interviews with
professional organizations and community elders were held.
Those willing to take part indicated by signing the consent form and returned a
signed consent form together with a completed short demographic questionnaire.
Participants who agreed to participate were also sent the survey questions. A second
round of key informant interviews in the form of group interview was conducted from
a list of people who participated in the study. A thematic analysis of group interview
data was undertaken.
Acculturation was measured using a modified version of the Vancouver Index of
Acculturation and the quality of life was measured separately using World Health
Organization measuring tool WHOQoL-Bref. The participants seemed to have ac-
cultured and intergrated well. The survey results on acculturation indicated that
as much as they maintained their culture, they also embraced the New Zealand cul-
ture. The Quality of life results showed that the participants were happy with their
quality of life
The study highlighted possibilities for further investigation as there was no linkage
between the two measuring instruments. The information from this research can be
used by social service agencies and health professionals to help settle future migrant

"15958","10092/806",,,,"Lim, Joanna Mei Lin",,,,,,,"2016",,,"The study took place in New Zealand where teachers inquire into their practice to learn
professionally. Teacher inquiry is a unique policy because it combines personal and 
professional motivations to learn. This policy places expectations on teachers to inquire into 
the impact of their teaching actions in terms of student learning. 

I used a narrative inquiry approach to gain insight into teachers  inquiry experiences. I 
conducted single, unstructured interviews with eleven, primary school teachers to listen to 
their stories. This narrative approach brought to the fore subjective conceptualisations of 
teacher inquiry and allowed me to use teacher stories as a construct to understand teacher 
inquiry further. I structured this thesis as a series of stories about context, methodology, 
inquiry experiences, deconstructive explorations, and impressions of the teacher inquiry
puzzle. 

A central research question,  How can teacher inquiry be conceptualised from teachers  
experiences?  guided the research process. This question grew into two sub-questions that 
featured different aspects of teacher inquiry. The first sub-question,  What are teachers  
experiences with teacher inquiry?  enabled me to expose the experiential effects of teacher 
inquiry. These idiosyncratic perceptions challenged me to think differently about teacher 
inquiry and prompted me to ask another sub-question,  What insights into teacher inquiry can 
be gained from applying a deconstructive lens on teachers  inquiry experiences?  To answer 
this question, I examined particular elements within teachers  experiences and used these 
elements to create deeper discussions about teacher inquiry. Since these deconstructive 
explorations tended to diverge from teacher stories, they allowed me to illuminate further
complexities within teacher inquiry. I used these stories and deconstructive explorations to 
create a montage of teacher inquiry in New Zealand. 
This study highlights how teacher inquiry can affect teachers  professional learning 
experiences, their teaching practices and professional identities. It brings to light the diverse 
ways that teachers make sense of internal and external expectations to learn professionally. I 
used this nuanced understanding of teacher inquiry to provide suggestions on how teachers 
can be better supported in the inquiry process. It is important to continue to strengthen the 
teacher inquiry process because it can ultimately contribute to student learning. These teacher 
inquiry insights can add to continuing discourse on teacher learning, because they explore the
complex challenge of using teacher learning as a means to improve student learning.",,,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/13266",,,"en","English",,,,"University of Canterbury",,,,,,,"http://library.canterbury.ac.nz/thesis/etheses_copyright.shtml","All Rights Reserved",,,,,,,,,,,,"Teacher inquiry in New Zealand : a montage.","Theses / Dissertations",,,,,,"University of Canterbury",,"Doctoral",,,"Doctor of Philosophy",,,"2453228",,"College of Education, Health and Human Development, University of Canterbury",,"joannadutoit@gmail.com",,,,,,,,,"Letitia Fickel"

The initial stimuli for this review came from two areas; an increasing understanding of the challenges of providing paediatric intensive care within the Canterbury District Health Board (CDHB) as well as the wider context of the South Island of New Zealand and a belief that appropriately targeted interprofessional simulation education could contribute to improved organizational culture and improved patient care. The final trigger can be considered as the death of a young infant who required paediatric intensive care. Her death may not have been avoidable but as a clinician involved with the case I, and many others, were moved to consider aspects of our healthcare in which improvements could be made. I believe that the efficient embedding of effective simulation clinical training is a core part of providing improvements in healthcare for the following reasons that will be elaborated on within this thesis: 
•	Continued quality improvement in the knowledge, skills and service-based application requires a recognition that it is not about the provision of service being in conflict with attendance at educational sessions but about both being necessary and complementary.
•	 Simulation of clinical scenarios provides the opportunity for regular practice of the core skills of individuals such that they become as automatic as driving a car, and as a result do not require significant cognitive energy input.
•	Simulation of clinical scenarios also provides the opportunity to practice those skills that are vital in specific situations but are rarely encountered within the workplace. It begins an individual’s cognitive preparation for the rare event. 
•	Regular department and team simulation enables the development of communication skills, with standardisation of communication processes and a common language, to enhance the efficiency and minimize the effect of bias, assumptions and misunderstandings. 
•	The skills of ‘teaming’ are modeled within the clinical simulation and within the workplace by faculty leading simulation. 
•	 The combination of clinical simulation with expert debriefing provides an opportunity to discuss processes that need improvement and the running of simulation within the workplace may highlight previously unrecognized latent errors within the system.",,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/13290",,,,"en","English",,,,"University of Canterbury",,,,,,,"http://library.canterbury.ac.nz/thesis/etheses_copyright.shtml","All Rights Reserved",,,,,,,,,,,,"Postgraduate simulation within a hospital setting, with a focus on crisis resource management and team training, in acute care paediatrics :   where are we and where should we be?","Theses / Dissertations",,,,,,"University of Canterbury",,"Masters",,,"Master of Health Sciences",,,,,"College of Education, Health and Human Development, University of Canterbury",,"Maggie.meeks@googlemail.com",,,,,,,,,"Ann Richardson"

Derived from semi-structured interviews with twenty two adult males, a constructivist-interpretivistic grounded theory methodological approach is then used, placing an emphasis on men’s own explanations of the phenomenon. The theory suggests that men’s decision making is influenced by three main factors: by their assessment of the ability to control functioning, by their beliefs related to perceived risks and benefits, and by the availability of certain skills and knowledge. This theory also identifies a decision-making style marked by a focus on information, both in providing it in disclosure and receiving it as support. From this theory a model is then developed of a five stage process of men’s decision-making related to their disclosure of mental wellbeing problems. A key factor in this model is that men’s self-assessment of having reached a coping threshold is a strong condition for them deciding to disclose problems to informal others. Overall, the five stage process of decision-making to informal others is described as progressive, meaning that as further decisions to disclose are made, men’s focus increasingly shifts towards the benefits of disclosure and, in particular, the benefits of the experiential knowledge of other men.",,,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/11503",,,"en","English",,,,"University of Canterbury",,,,,,,"http://library.canterbury.ac.nz/thesis/etheses_copyright.shtml","All Rights Reserved",,,,,,,,,,,,"A Theory of Men’s Help-Seeking from Informal Others for Mental Wellbeing Problems","Theses / Dissertations",,,,,"Health Sciences","University of Canterbury",,"Doctoral",,,"Doctor of Philosophy",,"2130443",,,"College of Education, Health and Human Development, University of Canterbury",,"karey.meisner@pg.canterbury.ac.nz",,,,,,,,,"Dr. Jeffrey Gage"
"16326","10092/806",,,,"Gandy, Jessamy",,,,,,,"2017",,,"Background: The disability sector in New Zealand has come a long way. There was a time when those with a disability were interred in “mental asylums” alongside prisoners and those who were mentally ill. In the 1930s individuals with an intellectual disability were recognised as a separate population and placed in institutions from the age of five years. Institutionalisation dominated the disability sector in the twentieth century. However, the last institution closed in 2006, ushering in an era of community living. The medical model or deficit based view of disability has been replaced in policy and legislation by the social model; however, the medical model still dominates. Despite these apparent positive changes parents who have a child diagnosed with a disability, special needs, or chronic health condition often have higher rates of stress, depression, and parental separation. Parents are required to navigate through a world of medical terms and eligibility criteria as they try to gain support and access to services. Parent to Parent New Zealand provides support to parents and caregivers of a person diagnosed with a disability, special needs, or a chronic health condition. The main way in which this support is provided is through clients of Parent to Parent being matched with a Support Parent, who is someone who has their own experience of supporting an individual with a disability. Although there has been international research on this supportive relationship, there has been no such research in the New Zealand population to date. Therefore the current study sought to answer three questions: who is accessing Parent to Parent NZ, why and what services are the accessing and finally did those who were paired with a Support Parent find the experience useful?

Methods: A national cross-sectional design was employed, utilising an electronically delivered questionnaire via the SurveyMonkey® (www.surveymonkey.com) platform. The questionnaire underwent piloting before implementation. In addition to demographic information, the survey tool used in this study adapted instruments used in previous studies such as the Kansas Inventory of Parent Perceptions (KIPP) and the Parent Coping Efficacy Scale (PCES) to yield quantitative data. Opportunity was given for participants to leave comments which provided support to the quantitative data. Descriptive thematic analysis was used to assess these comments. Participants were recruited through Parent to Parent via their mailing list, electronic media (such as electronic newsletters, Facebook, and Twitter), and their national magazine. There was no restriction on the timeframe in which participants are or were involved with Parent to Parent. The survey was available nationally providing the person had access to the internet. The advertisement placed in the Parent to Parent media supplied a link to an online survey where participants were asked to complete a 10-15 minute survey. The survey consisted of three sections, totalling 28 questions. The first section collected demographic information, the second section collected information on what services participants have accessed at Parent to Parent and why they accessed those services, the third section looked at the impact of being paired with a Support Parent. Reporting followed best epidemiological practice and was informed by the STROBE guidelines (www.strobe-statement.org), which were used as guidance throughout the study.

Results: Of an estimated total population of 10,600 parents involved with Parent to Parent New Zealand, 26 participants accessed the online questionnaire by using a link that was provided on the various advertised mediums. Participants were predominantly New Zealand Europeans from two-parent households. All of the participants were the biological parents of individuals with a disability, special needs, or a chronic health condition. Quantitative and qualitative data was gathered from information provided by the 24 participants who completed sections 1 and 2 of the questionnaire. Further quantitative data was provided by the 19 participants who were matched with a Support Parent at the time they participated in the study. Forty-six percent of contacts with Parent to Parent were seeking information from the organisation. Sixty-seven percent found the information service the most useful service offered by Parent to Parent, surpassing the Support Parent connection at forty-six percent. Overall, participants reported a positive interaction with their Support Parent with sixty-two percent feeling that their Support Parent match worked for them. However, only forty-two percent of the participants gave a positive response to feeling as though their Support Parent gave them someone to talk to about their child’s disability. No significant relationships were found between the participants’ level of existing support (such as partner or family) and the severity of the disability (all Fisher’s exact tests p>0.05). A thematic analysis of the comments made by the participants revealed similar themes previously found in other studies.

Discussion: Despite many efforts, participation in the survey was disappointing. The diminutive sample size meant statistical power was too small to detect significant differences in the quantitative data and so no firm conclusions could be drawn from the results of this study. Whilst the results of this study drew similar themes to overseas research, due to its sample size it can only be viewed as an exploratory piece of work. Further research is still required to determine whether peer support via organisations such as Parent to Parent is an effective tool to assist parents to feel empowered, less isolated and better able to cope.",,,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/13605",,,"en","English",,,,"University of Canterbury",,,,,,,"http://library.canterbury.ac.nz/thesis/etheses_copyright.shtml","All Rights Reserved",,,,,,,,,,,,"Impact of parent peer support to parents of a child with a disability, special needs, or chronic health condition: a national cross-sectional survey",,,"Electronic Thesis or Dissertation",,"Health Sciences",,"University of Canterbury",,"Masters",,,"Master of Health Sciences",,"2488861",,,"College of Education, Health and Human Development, University of Canterbury",,"Jessamy_g@hotmail.com",,,,,,,,,"Professor Philip Schluter"

Learning to cope effectively with moments of tension is an important part of a child?s education because adaptation to stress is likely to influence academic and developmental success. However, empirical gaps exist with respect to stress and coping. There is a general lack of research concerned with stress and coping in educational settings, and what has been published focuses on adolescent and adult populations rather than children. Additionally, the majority of research addresses major life stress (e.g., traumatic events) rather than the everyday stress that students encounter at school. This dissertation is an effort to address these concerns. Comprised of three studies, the project examines the stress that students in middle childhood (Grades 3-5) commonly experience at school, how students cope with stress at school, and what educators might do to help students develop adaptive coping strategies. Results illustrate the daily school stress in students, need for students to learn how to manage academic and peer problems, and role of the teacher in coping development.

In particular it examines the ways this leader has shared leadership with his teachers, has involved parents and the wider community in student learning and how he has taken students into the community to strengthen their learning of curriculum content through experiential learning. It also examines strategies the principal has used to gain the collaboration of his community and of the external committee that manages the school, and the organisational changes he has made. His innovations are significant because they offer a model of shared responsibility for engagement with teachers, students and community in the Bangladeshi context where authoritarian leadership is the more common practice. This case study offers a contribution to educational change that is drawn from working within the local context rather than being based on outside, and possibly alien, international models.
The primary data collection tool for examining initiatives and actions is an extended sequence of professional dialogues with the principal. In addition, observation, interviews and school documents as well as a reflective journal provide further data. A narrative form has been used to present his practices and intentions because the research emphasis is on the principal’s perceptions and understandings. The thesis has identified the personal traits, qualities, skills and creativity that have enabled the principal to reconnoitre and strategically overcome barriers in order to improve learning outcomes and community well-being. In the words of the Bengali writer Thakur, he does transform apparent walls into doors.
While there is a large body of international literature about theory and practices of school leadership, there is little that comes from and is based in Bangladesh. However context is important; this study shows education in Bangladesh takes place under different conditions and has different needs from those that give rise to much of the literature. This contextualised study is therefore significant for policy and further practice within Bangladesh.
This thesis offers an example of how an entrepreneurial and inspiring principal involved his teachers, students and parents in re-positioning the school and community in tackling and surmounting the overt obstacles to school improvement and significantly overcoming the gap between vision and outcomes. The detailed investigation and report show that, even in a highly centralised and seemingly restrictive system, real differences can be made and can be effective, although time has yet to tell whether they can be sustained in the long term. This study demonstrates that while there is still a lot to do in improving education in Bangladesh, it is not always necessary to look outside for effective models for change: some are being developed within the country.
This thesis highlights the importance and complex components of school leadership that have been little researched in Bangladesh. While action in one school in itself cannot make a large impact on education in the country as a whole, it can be taken as a model for inspiration and critical reflection for guiding the professional development of principals and teachers. It provides a working model that could be used and for informing policy about the selection of principals and strategic resourcing of schools. It offers a platform for further research and reflection in Bangladesh as well as informing other contexts internationally.",,,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/11961",,,"en","English",,,,"University of Canterbury",,,,,,,"http://library.canterbury.ac.nz/thesis/etheses_copyright.shtml","All Rights Reserved",,,,,,,,,,,,"Making a door : a case study of the leadership and change practices of a principal in Bangladesh.","Theses / Dissertations",,,,,"Education","University of Canterbury",,"Doctoral",,,"Doctor of Philosophy",,"2273381",,,"College of Education, Health and Human Development, University of Canterbury",,"abu.salahuddin@du.ac.bd",,,,,,,,,"Professor Janinka Greenwood"

full social inclusion and the equal rights and participation of minority groups, including
people with disabilties. Children with disabilities are particularly vulnerable to negative peer
attitudes, which may result in them feeling excluded and alienated in the school environment.
Research has linked empathy to pro-social behaviour, and has suggested it as a mediator
between direct intergroup contact and positive attitude outcomes. Within a geographically
localised, general intermediate (years 7 and 8) school setting, this study aimed to evaluate the
effects of a manualised disability awareness programme on children’s empathy and attitudes
towards peers with disabilities. Participants were New Zealand students aged 11-13 years
from four classes within two Christchurch intermediate schools, and comprised an
intervention group (n = 89) and waitlist control group (n = 30). Self-report measures were
employed, in a pre-post design with nine week follow up. The intervention incorporated
multiple components including direct contact with an adult with a disability as programme
facilitator. Results showed no significant difference in children’s empathy and attitudes at
baseline or post-test between intervention groups. Significant attitude improvement was
evident for a sub-group of high academic achievers. A significant moderate correlation was
also demonstrated between attitude and empathy. Possible causes for a lack of overall effect
were discussed, as well as implications for future programme implementation. Future
research should continue to explore the programme elements of manualised disability

"9981","10092/806",,,"Solomon, Catherine Ann",,,,,,,,"2014",,,"Children’s beliefs about mathematics involve epistemological beliefs about the subject, its nature and how it works, as well as beliefs about who can and cannot do mathematics. While children’s beliefs about mathematics have been linked to their achievement in mathematics, there is little research that explores beliefs about mathematics in the New Zealand context. A general concern is that students do less well than they could at mathematics; hence many people give up on and disengage from mathematics. 

This study explores children’s and their teachers’ beliefs about mathematics and is set against a backdrop of prevailing achievement discourses, both in New Zealand and abroad, that define people’s perceived abilities as usually based on ethnicity and gender. It also considers the multiple worlds of the child, the worlds of mathematics beliefs and of doing school mathematics, the child’s relationships with these worlds and with others who inhabit them. 

The study combines complementary theories and methods to examine espoused and enacted mathematics beliefs by adopting a predominantly sociocultural perspective and including a combination of constructivist and pragmatic theories as well as multiple methods of accessing and analysing beliefs. In order to develop a picture of mathematics beliefs, I collected data from a number of sources: mathematics beliefs questionnaires from 823 children at 17 schools, drawings from 180 children at two focus schools, video recordings of multiple mathematics lessons in two focus classrooms and observations. The following year, I revisited, observed and interviewed nine focus children and their teachers. I applied multiple analysis ‘frames’ to the data: factor analysis, adapted visual frameworks, metaphors and themes. 

By combining a variety of methods and applying a number of different analysis perspectives, this study exposed a rich and complex landscape of beliefs about mathematics. In particular, the children’s drawings communicated mathematics beliefs by using metaphors such as ‘maths as problem solving’, ‘maths as useful’, ‘maths as life’, and ‘maths as brain burn inducing’. The children and teachers exhibited a range of beliefs about the world of mathematics and who belongs to this world by positioning certain people as good at mathematics, not good at mathematics, or in certain cases, both positions depending on the context. In terms of assigned mathematics identities, both children and teachers refer to the ‘Asian as good at maths’ discourse but do not position Māori and Pasifika as weak; gender was not viewed as important. On the other hand, the children’s responses were influenced by their ethnicities, gender, socioeconomic status and mathematics achievement levels. The implications for primary school mathematics relate to the powerful influence of how mathematics is done, taught and learnt within the dominant context of the Numeracy Projects which governs ability groupings, the dance of the mathematics class, the ascendency of strategy over algorithm, and the notion that there are multiple ways to solve problems. In particular, the implications of inequality inherent in mathematics ability grouping warrants addressing.",,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/8981",,,,"en",,,,,"University of Canterbury.

school, is promoted almost universally as both a moral and a political imperative.
From this perspective inclusion, and only inclusion, is equated with just educational
provision for disabled children and young people. But at the same time, special school
provision is a feature of many, if not most, education systems. In a policy climate in
which inclusion is the dominant motif, the special school sector is an anomaly and
special schools inevitably occupy an uncertain and somewhat invidious position. This
situation raises a number of questions concerning matters of justice and fairness with
respect to its impact on special schools and their communities. It also raises questions
about the validity of the view that inclusion, and only inclusion, can represent justice
in education for all disabled children and young people.
This thesis explores these matters from a philosophical perspective and with
particular reference to the turn to inclusion in New Zealand’s education policy context
in the years 1987-2005. It examines the realities of the development of the policy
Special Education 2000 (SE2000) and the experience of special schools under that
policy. It also presents a philosophically based examination and critique of the notion
of justice with respect to location that underpins inclusion and inclusive education
policies such as SE2000. Drawing on the work of I.M. Young (1990), the thesis
argues that the privileging of inclusion in SE2000 positioned special school provision
as a lesser and undesirable alternative, and resulted in a state of affairs in which some
disabled children and their families experienced, or were more likely to experience,
injustice.
The examination of the New Zealand setting provides the context from which
the broader philosophical concerns of the thesis emanate. These centre on the broader
question of what, with respect to where they go to school, might constitute a just state
of affairs in education for disabled children. The thesis presents a critique of the
notion that inclusion is the only educational arrangement that constitutes a just state of
affairs for disabled children. It argues that the availability of special school provision
rather than being a barrier can be a factor that contributes to a just state of affairs in
the educational arrangements for disabled children. The thesis concludes that as
regards the matter of location, what is required to achieve a just state of affairs for
disabled children and their families is a nuanced approach that will mitigate injustice
in their daily lives and reflect the multiple views, values and aspirations they hold.",,,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/12113",,,"en","English",,,,"University of Canterbury",,,,,,,"http://library.canterbury.ac.nz/thesis/etheses_copyright.shtml","All Rights Reserved",,,,,,,,,,,,"A puzzling matter : special schools, justice, and inclusion.","Theses / Dissertations",,,,,"Education","University of Canterbury",,"Doctoral",,,"Doctor of Philosophy",,"2315951",,,"College of Education, Health and Human Development, University of Canterbury",,"Irish. mcmenamin@canterbury. a c. nz",,,,,,,,,"Professor Peter Roberts"

The study was conducted using the combination of a phenomenological and Kaupapa Māori approach, and consisted of semi-structured interviews with seven Māori students and three parents conducted in 2012. Findings from the study suggest that the participants define having success as Māori as the opportunity to develop strengths in relation to both Mātauranga Pākehā and Mātauranga Maori.

however, only three participants identified as teaching it. In Part Two, the
participants showed some general understanding of Olympism, however, they were
unable to give a clear and concise definition. They thought that the development of
moral character was an important part of physical education and could see that
Olympism could be used to develop this. Participants could see implicit links
between Olympism and the curriculum; those who taught Olympism did so using a
wide variety of implicit and explicit approaches. This research highlighted that
Olympism does have a presence in physical education; however, considerable work
needs to be done to ensure that this is consistent and effective. From this research, I
suggest a focus on pre-service and in-service education, the updating of resources and
development of a daily lesson framework to improve the teaching of Olympism in

2007 in the six teacher-training universities directly under the Ministry of Education, P. R.
China. Informed by the Expectancy-Value theory and the Undermining Effect of Extrinsic
Reward theory, the study reported in this thesis explores the impacts of this funding policy on
career-choice motivation and study engagement of Chinese pre-service teachers. It employed
a combination of quantitative and qualitative methods with the quantitative approaches as a
base to explore the impacts of the funding policy and the qualitative methods as an additional
follow-up layer to reflect on the quantitative findings.
Quantitative data were obtained via 712 questionnaires administered to Chinese pre-service
teachers from three universities in P.R. China. These participants are comprised of the policyfunded
pre-service teachers (N=309) and the self-sponsored pre-service teachers (N=403) in
their first-year and last-year undergraduate studies in diverse teacher-training programmes.
These data were analysed through multiple quantitative methods. Qualitative data were
gathered by online audio interviews with seven policy-funded pre-service teachers having
different attitudes towards the funding policy, and reported in seven narrative stories.
The main finding reported in this study was that the funding policy has had no negative
impacts on Chinese pre-service teachers’ motivation to choose teaching as a future career or
on their current study engagement in teacher-training programmes. The finding could be
supported by the Expectancy-Value theory together with the narrative stories which argue
that the opposite impacts of different terms in the funding policy on career-choice motivation
and study engagement could counteract with each other to show “no negative impacts”. This
finding, along with the relatively higher intrinsic career-choice motivation of policy-funded
pre-service teachers, suggests that the policy aim to establish a stable and high-quality
teaching force for the country has the potential to be achieved. However, potential
undermining effects of the funding policy on intrinsic career-choice motivation and study
engagement were identified, which suggest the funding policy still needs to be improved.
In addition, findings of this study added knowledge to the research field of teacher motivation
in Chinese context, such as the types, ranking, and classification model of career-choice
motivation for Chinese pre-service teachers, and the relationship between their career-choice
motivation and study engagement. Chinese pre-service teachers’ demographic profile, 
iv
perceptions about teaching, and attitudes towards the funding policy were also described in
this study.
Implications of these findings for the funding policy, teacher education, and career education
in China are discussed. Recommendations are also suggested with the aim of increasing

communication technology (ICT) within teacher education programs in Bangladesh.
The study is set within the context of a nationwide focus on ICT shaped by the
Bangladesh Government’s National Information and Communication Technology
(ICT) Policy – 2009. The intention of this policy is to increase the use and
understanding of ICT by introducing specific courses in primary, secondary and
tertiary education, technical and vocational education, and teacher education
programs. Aligned with this overarching ICT policy, the National Education Policy,
2010, places special emphasis on the integration of ICT in education by
recommending that ICT is taught as a separate learning area, and that it is used as a
tool across all curriculum areas. Consequently the National Education Policy
recommends that all teachers receive training to make the best use of ICT for
educational purposes. Given the critical role of teachers in implementing these
policies, this study explores teacher educators’ perceptions of ICT within the teacher
education programs in Bangladesh. Ten educators from four different teachers’
training colleges (TTC) were interviewed to explore their experiences and
understandings of ICT. This study found that the teacher educators believe ICT is
more than a simple teaching-learning tool because it has potential for constructing
knowledge and enhancing the quality of education. They also recognized that ICT
provides relative advantages over traditional teaching tools, and that it facilitates
professional learning via access to current knowledge from national and international
sources. However, the educators also understood that the mere provision of
computers or ICT in institutions does not ensure quality education. Teachers need to
develop technological knowledge about how ICTs work; an understanding of
pedagogical strategies that utilize ICT; and the capability to design learning
experiences that appropriately integrate technology in relation to learning content. In
addition, teacher educators should also be prepared with both pedagogical and
andragogical knowledge of teaching about and with ICT. The teacher education
programs should integrate ICT in cross-curricular activities so that the trainee teachers can experience how to use ICT in different subject areas. Therefore, ICT
courses in the B.Ed. curriculum in Bangladesh should be enriched not only with
computer operational skills but also with features of social communication,
knowledge construction and dissemination. It is also understood that the successful
integration of ICT in Bangladeshi education requires a supportive professional
culture and appropriate support from different educational administrative layers
including the government sector.",,,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/12143",,,"en","English",,,,"University of Canterbury",,,,,,,"http://library.canterbury.ac.nz/thesis/etheses_copyright.shtml","All Rights Reserved",,,,,,,,,,,,"A case study exploring Bangladeshi teacher educators' perspectives of information and communication technology (ICT) in education.","Theses / Dissertations",,,,,"Education","University of Canterbury",,"Masters",,,"Master of Education",,"2316143",,,"College of Education, Health and Human Development, University of Canterbury",,"ucresearchrepository@canterbury.ac.nz",,,,,,,,,"Julie Mackey"
"14153","10092/806",,,,"Niles, Anna Jean",,,,,,,"2016",,,"This qualitative research study aimed to take a closer look at assessment understandings and practice within one early childhood setting. Narrative assessment is a relative newcomer to early childhood education and teachers have been working with narrative assessments in the form of learning stories for just over a decade now. However, in Aotearoa New Zealand there is increasing discussion about the benefits of narrative forms of assessment, in particular the learning story framework as the main way to assess children’s learning (Ministry of Education, 2015c; Mitchell, et al., 2015a). The research was undertaken at a time when there is increasing interest in the effectiveness of the early childhood curriculum Te Whāriki: He Whāriki Mātauranga mō ngā Mokopuna o Aotearoa (Ministry of Education, 1996) and related assessment practices .This study aimed to take a closer look at teachers’ understanding and enactment of assessment guided by the following research questions: How are teachers assessing children’s learning in early childhood settings? How do teachers make sense of learning assessments? What are early childhood teachers’ understandings of learning assessments?
Key findings within this study suggest teachers were continuing to come to terms with the complexities of assessment and how to make it work within their context. Teachers were using a range of differing strategies to try and make sense of assessment and consulted key early childhood literature to support their understanding and use of assessment. These qualified, experienced teachers were striving to get it ‘right’ and shift assessment practices. Individually and collectively teachers were working towards developing a shared understanding of assessment priorities. Working in a team environment and valuing the perspectives of the learning community added another level of complexity as teachers worked toward increasingly meaningful ways to document children’s learning using the learning story framework. Teachers found it challenging to place children’s perceived ‘deficits’ in a credit based assessment model. Although teachers regularly discussed children’s ‘needs’ together and with parents, ‘needs’ were often not documented within assessments. Balancing contrasting views of assessment and negotiating what should be documented was hard and at times teachers questioned the authenticity of documented assessment. Teachers wanted more time to talk with each other and the learning community as they continued to make sense of assessment. Making assessment work was however a priority for this group of teachers as they worked toward getting assessment ‘right’.
Informal and formal assessments of children’s learning are often used to guide teachers’ curriculum decision making processes. Well-developed assessment practices can have a profound effect on children’s experiences and perceptions of themselves as capable learners. The responsibility for ensuring that teachers are up to the task of confidently using assessment lies not only with teachers themselves but also with: advice and guidance agencies, professional development and policy support, initial teacher education providers and induction and mentoring programmes. Strong support is required in order for assessment to reach its full potential as a powerful tool for decision making and implementation of the early childhood curriculum.",,,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/12142",,,"en","English",,,,"University of Canterbury",,,,,,,"http://library.canterbury.ac.nz/thesis/etheses_copyright.shtml","All Rights Reserved",,,,,,,,,,,,"Complexities of assessment : striving to get it 'right'.","Theses / Dissertations",,,,,"Education","University of Canterbury",,"Masters",,,"Master of Education",,"2316144",,,"College of Education, Health and Human Development, University of Canterbury",,"tommo5@xtra.co.nz",,,,,,,,,"Missy Morton"

Part of this approach includes using feedback as an intervention. This feedback, discussed by the counsellor and client at the end of a counselling session, aims to highlight and validate clients’ strengths and resources and encourages the client to use these (to construct a task) and help achieve the change s/he wants. The semi-formal structure of the feedback is termed the summation message. While it is considered an essential part of solution-focused brief therapy, little research on its use is available, particularly from the client’s perspective. This thesis addresses this gap in the research. I conducted solution-focused counselling with three clients and, using qualitative research methods, gathered their perspectives on what they experienced as helpful from the summation messages. I also explored how engaging in the research informed my own solution-focused practice. Research data consisted of transcribed counselling interviews, observation notes, counselling notes, analytic and reflexive memos. I used a thematic analysis approach, informed by the interpretive paradigm, to analyse the data and generate four major themes on clients’ perspectives of the feedback technique. Excerpts of client responses highlight the following themes: the break time helped clients to recognise their own resources and enabled the development of client-chosen tasks; feedback encouraged clients to describe their own tasks; feedback encouraged a deeper awareness about resources identified in the counselling session and reflecting on the co-construction of their own solutions enabled clients to feel empowered by their summation messages.

"13467","10092/806",,,,"Farmer, Alison",,,,,,,"2015",,,"Type 2 diabetes is almost three times more prevalent in the indigenous people of New Zealand (Māori) than non-Māori. Despite the high rate of diabetes there is a low level of diabetes knowledge and awareness in the Māori community. Several studies of Māori health identify a need for new health communication approaches to diabetes prevention in order to reduce the gap between Māori and non-Māori disease rates.
Several problems can be identified with existing health promotion and education materials about type 2 diabetes for Māori. There is a gap in the literature reporting on what constitutes a culturally appropriate research process for health communication with Māori. A second problem is a difficulty ascertaining how and if health behaviour theory was selected when designing health promotion materials for type 2 diabetes with Māori. There is a need to make explicit the research process and employment of theory in the design of health promotion materials. In addition, little is known about how Māori understand or experience type 2 diabetes, or the social and cultural meaning given to the disease. These are significant gaps because a tenet of effective health communication is the need to engage with and understand how cultural, social, environmental and historical factors influence health behaviours.
The research objective was to ascertain how Community Based Participatory Research (CBPR) in combination with indigenous principles and behavioural theory could be employed to create a culturally appropriate resource for Christchurch adult Māori at risk for type 2 diabetes. This study describes the rationale for and process of working in partnership with an indigenous population to develop a health communication resource that reflects Māori beliefs and cultural practices.
Principles of CBPR were applied to a qualitative research design employing community engagement and partnership, key informant interviews and hui (focus groups) to inform the messaging of a diabetes prevention documentary. In order to decolonise the research process, Walters et al.’s (2009) “indigenist” research principles were incorporated into the research design and evaluation.
The research findings revealed diabetes prevention is a complex and multifaceted problem in the Māori community. There was a clear lack of knowledge and understanding about the causes of type 2 diabetes. At the same time it was common to have witnessed family members die from the disease. This resulted in a strong sense of fatalism and the belief that diabetes is a death sentence. Second, there are multiple barriers for Māori in improving health and preventing the disease. They are economic, social, cultural and institutional. As a result, depression, stress, low self-esteem and low motivation impede health behaviour change. However, the community also identified viable solutions. These included a holistic model of care, collectivist whānau based approaches, and taking small and achievable steps.
These findings were then incorporated into the documentary messaging. Community members helped determine the approach to and content of the documentary. Bandura’s social cognitive theory provided a culturally sensitive theoretical basis for behaviour change in the creation of the documentary. A communications focus on whānau (family) was culturally important and positioned as a key reward to implementing health changes.
This study concludes that a CBPR approach provides an appropriate model for enacting local action-oriented approaches in the creation of a diabetes prevention documentary that reflects Māori cultural beliefs, practices, and a narrative tradition. This research contributes to the small body of international literature concentrating on the perception and lay understanding of diabetes within indigenous communities and the social and cultural meaning given to the disease. This study supports previous research that has found that CBPR is a strong model for working with indigenous populations when designing and implementing type 2 diabetes health communication materials. The application of CBPR in combination with indigenous principles provides an appropriate framework for non-Māori researchers to support culturally appropriate research that honours indigenous values and protocols.",,,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/11656",,,"en","English",,,,"University of Canterbury",,,,,,,"http://library.canterbury.ac.nz/thesis/etheses_copyright.shtml","All Rights Reserved",,,,,,,,,,,,"A Community Based Participatory Research Approach to Create a Diabetes Prevention Documentary for Māori","Theses / Dissertations",,,,,"Health Sciences","University of Canterbury",,"Doctoral",,,"Doctor of Philosophy",,"2132696",,,"College of Education, Health and Human Development, University of Canterbury",,"alison.farmer@pg.canterbury.ac.nz",,,,,,,,,"Dr. Jeffrey Gage"

Historically, Māori have been forced, through assimilation, to adopt and accept methods of teaching and learning that are inconsistent with traditional Māori education practices. These historical practices are also evident in the current dominance of euro-centric education philosophies and practices observed in many schools throughout Aotearoa New Zealand today.

The study is based on Kaupapa Māori theory and utilised qualitative research methods to explore 13 Māori teachers’, parents’ and board of trustee members’ observations and experiences of tamariki Māori in educational settings. The study provided a forum and audience for participants’ observations and reflections. Their kōrero (dialogue) was recorded and thematically analysed. Four overarching themes identified were: Te Ao Māori, Tino Rangatiratanga, Ako, and Tangata Whenua. A series of subthemes were also identified within each main theme. These themes with accompanying quotations from participants provide a voice for the people interviewed to express their narrative concerning education of their tamariki (children).

The voices of participants also alluded to a range of potential strategies and solutions that could support Māori tamariki to experience education success. Central to improving outcomes for Māori is the need for whānau, school teachers, management and governance to reconsider their worldviews and practices to better align with the cultural needs of Māori, and to recognise the ongoing impact of historical injustices.

The research is conceptualized within the theoretical framework of community of practice and draws on social network perspective. It also adopts a poststructuralist perspective to present the dynamic socio-cultural process of how these teachers experienced and made meaning of various discourses about their teaching, researching and personal lives.

The discourses from the workplace, the social context and teachers themselves make these CE teachers’ social networks and identities a site of ambivalence and struggles. Entrenched in a lower-status department, CE teachers struggled with various meanings of knowledge: the officially-valued research, the teaching-research, linguistics/western literature research, non-linguistics/western literature research, quantitative research and qualitative research.

"17657","10092/806",,,,"Bourke, John Augustus",,,,,,,"2017",,,"Background The 2010/2011 Canterbury earthquakes and aftershocks in New Zealand caused unprecedented destruction to the physical, social, economic, and community fabric of Christchurch city. The recovery phase in Christchurch is on going, six years following the initial earthquake. Research exploring how disabled populations experience community inclusion in the longer-term recovery following natural disasters is scant. Yet such information is vital to ensure that recovering communities are inclusive for all members of the affected population. This thesis specifically examined how people who use wheelchairs experienced community inclusion four years following the 2010/2011 Canterbury earthquakes.

Aims The primary research aim was to understand how one section of the disability community – people who use wheelchairs – experienced community inclusion over the four years following the 2010/2011 Canterbury earthquakes and aftershocks. A secondary aim was to test a novel sampling approach, Respondent Driven Sampling, which had the potential to enable unbiased population-based estimates. This was motivated by the lack of an available sampling frame for the target population, which would inhibit recruitment of a representative sample.

Methodology and methods An exploratory sequential mixed methods design was used, beginning with a qualitative phase (Phase One), which informed a second quantitative phase (Phase Two). The qualitative phase had two stages. First, a small sample of people who use wheelchairs participated in an individual, semi-structured interview. In the second stage, these participants were then invited to a group interview to clarify and prioritise themes identified in the individual interviews.

The quantitative phase was a cross-sectional survey developed from the findings from Phase One. Initially, Respondent Driven Sampling was employed to conduct a national, electronic cross-sectional survey that aimed to recruit a sample that may provide unbiased population-based estimates. Following the unsuccessful application of Respondent Driven Sampling, a region-specific convenience sampling approach was used. The datasets from the qualitative and quantitative phases were integrated to address the primary aim of the research.

Results In Phase One 13 participants completed the individual interviews, and five of them contributed to the group interview. Thematic analysis of individual and group interview data suggested that participants felt the 2010/11 earthquakes magnified many pre-existing barriers to community inclusion, and also created an exciting opportunity for change. This finding was encapsulated in five themes: 1) earthquakes magnified barriers, 2) community inclusion requires energy, 3) social connections are important, 4) an opportunity lost, and 5) an opportunity found. The findings from Phase One informed the development of a survey instrument to investigate how these findings generalised to a larger sample of individuals who use wheelchairs.

In Phase Two, the Respondent Driven Sampling approach failed to recruit enough participants to satisfy the statistical requirements needed to reach equilibrium, thereby enabling the calculation of unbiased population estimates. The subsequent convenience sampling approach recruited 49 participants who, combined with the 15 participants from the Respondent Driven Sampling approach that remained eligible for the region-specific sample, resulted in the total of 64 individuals who used wheelchairs and were residents of Christchurch.

Participants reported their level of community inclusion at three time periods: the six months prior to the first earthquake in September 2010 (time one), the six months following the first earthquake in September 2010 (time two), and the six months prior to survey completion (between October 2015 and March 2016, (time three)). Survey data provided some precision regarding the timing in which the magnified barriers developed. Difficulty with community inclusion rose significantly between time one and time two, and while reducing slightly, was still present during time three, and had not returned to the time one baseline. The integrated findings from Phase One and Phase Two suggested that magnified barriers to community inclusion had been sustained four years post-earthquake, and community access had not returned to pre-earthquake levels, let alone improved beyond pre-earthquake levels.

Conclusion Findings from this mixed methods study suggest that four years following the initial earthquake, participants were still experiencing multiple magnified barriers, which contributed to physical and social exclusion, as well as fatigue, as participants relied on individual agency to negotiate such barriers. Participants also highlighted the exciting opportunity to create an accessible city. However because they were still experiencing barriers four years following the initial event, and were concerned that this opportunity might be lost if the recovery proceeds without commitment and awareness from the numerous stakeholders involved in guiding the recovery. To truly realise the opportunity to create an accessible city following a disaster, the transition from the response phase to a sustainable longer-term recovery must adopt a new model of community engagement where decision-makers partner with people living with disability to co-produce a vision and strategy for creating an inclusive community. Furthermore, despite the unsuccessful use of Respondent Driven Sampling in this study, future research exploring the application of RDS with wheelchair users is recommended before discounting this sampling approach in this population.",,,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/14421",,,"en","English",,,,"University of Canterbury",,,,,,,"http://library.canterbury.ac.nz/thesis/etheses_copyright.shtml","All Rights Reserved",,,,,,,,,,,,"Understanding the longer-term experience of community inclusion for wheelchair users following the 2010/2011 Canterbury earthquakes: A mixed methods study",,,"Electronic Thesis or Dissertation",,,"Health Sciences","University of Canterbury",,"Doctoral",,,"Doctor of Philosophy",,,"2532341",,"College of Education, Health and Human Development, University of Canterbury",,"johnnyabourke@gmail.com",,,,,,,,,"Professor Philip Schluter"
"15649","10092/806",,,,"Tanner, Vicki",,,,,,,"2016",,,"Solution-focused therapy is a client-centred, strengths-based approach that aims to work with clients to help them recognise their own unique abilities and resources that they can use to make positive change in their lives. Solution-focused counsellors frequently conclude consultations by agreeing with the client on something useful for them to do between sessions with the aim of clients taking small steps towards their therapeutic goals. There is little research investigating this co-construction of between-session tasks and none that explores the clients’ experiences of this process. This study attempts to address this gap in the literature. Qualitative methods and a case study design were used to explore both the process and the clients’ experiences relating to between-session task discussions. This research was conducted in a New Zealand high school counselling setting with 4 adolescent participants who each participated in a maximum of 5 individual, solution-focused counselling sessions and 1 semi-structured final interview. Research data from transcripts of counselling sessions and final interviews and researcher observations and reflections were analysed using inductive thematic analysis. Four themes emerged: co-constructive conversations about client goals and past successes reveal appropriate between-session tasks; tasks were seen to be helpful and worked to build client confidence and support clients’ thinking; client suggested tasks were most ideal, however if tasks were aligned to what clients wanted, counsellor suggested tasks were acceptable; following up on how clients engaged with tasks (when they did not arise naturally in conversation) provided useful information for the therapeutic process and was helpful for clients. Findings from this practice-based research make a useful contribution to the current literature, showing how between-sessions tasks can be talked about in solution-focused counselling sessions with adolescents, and most importantly add the client’s perspective about this specific part of the counselling process.",,,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/12813",,,"en","English",,,,"University of Canterbury",,,,,,,"http://library.canterbury.ac.nz/thesis/etheses_copyright.shtml","All Rights Reserved",,,,,,,,,,,,"Homework tasks : an exploration into how between-session tiasks are co-constructed and experienced by adolescents in solution-focused counselling sessions.","Theses / Dissertations",,,,,"Counselling","University of Canterbury","","",,,"Master of Counselling",,"2381078",,,"College of Education, Health and Human Development, University of Canterbury",,"vickitanner59@gmail. com",,,,,,,,,"Shanee Banaclough"

A qualitative case study research approach is used. The context of this study is the counselling service of a high school where young men are aged between 13 and 18 years of age. These are often turbulent years for teenagers and high school presents its own challenges irrespective of those faced at home or in other contexts. The counselling they are offered uses a solution-focused approach where the purpose is to encourage clients to create their own preferred future and strategies for achieving this. The aim of this study is to help the young men engage and gain benefit from their counselling.
Students were invited to volunteer to be part of this study. The four selected presented with reasons for coming to counselling similar to those of students typically seeking counselling (work/study and relationship issues). Each participant consented to engage in solution-focused counselling where the counsellor used a range of kinaesthetic and visual tools to assist in the counselling process. Counselling sessions were videoed and analysed with specific focus on client engagement. Four key findings emerged. Firstly, the use of SFBT tools and strategies produced increased verbal interaction (i.e. more talking); secondly a range of non-verbal expressions including changes in body language were displayed as signs of engagement; thirdly the clarification of goal/s through visual/practical scales evoked positive talk and ownership over the student’s future; and finally self-reflection by the researcher on the impact of each counselling session produced positive and improved outcomes on the researcher’s own counselling practice.",,,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/12828",,,"en","English",,,,"University of Canterbury",,,,,,,"http://library.canterbury.ac.nz/thesis/etheses_copyright.shtml","All Rights Reserved",,,,,,,,,,,,"Exploring the use of strategies to support Solution Focused Brief Therapy (SFBT) to enhance engagement with adolescent males: one counsellor’s experience.","Theses / Dissertations",,,,"Counselling",,"University of Canterbury",,"Masters",,,"Master of Counselling",,"2377200",,,"College of Education, Health and Human Development, University of Canterbury",,"clairewashington9@gmail.com",,,,,,,,,"Associate Professor Judi Miller"

"16537","10092/806",,,"Hughes, Margaret Eleanor",,,,,,,,"2017",,,"Direction and delegation is a professional competency required of all New Zealand nurses and all nurses must attest to understanding direction and delegation on their annual practicing certificate application. However, the literature on how New Zealand nurses managed their direction and delegation interactions was silent. This thesis offers a New Zealand perspective and contributes to the discussion found in the overseas nursing literature about delegation.

The purpose of the study was to explore nurses’ perceptions about their everyday direction and delegation experiences using a narrative approach. The role of story in narrative research reflected my own views about the importance of story in nursing. Nurses are responsible for informing others in handovers, progress notes, health information education sessions and inter-disciplinary meetings. This is carried out through a series of different stories depending on the audience which includes patients, nursing and medical colleagues, support staff or whānau and family. The narrative plots made possible by the methodology and methods of narrative research uncovered how nurses made sense of direction and delegation in their workplace.

As the Enrolled and Registered Nurse Agents shared their own storied experiences it was revealed that working in a team differs to working as a team, and that both are needed; that communicating well and professionally were vital to the success or not of the delegation interaction; and that nurses needed to form a delegation relationship rather than provide a set of instructions. The ability to meet this professional obligation requires skill and knowledge, and more workplace relevant information from nurses in leadership roles to support ‘good’ direction and delegation interactions.

Taken together the eight major patterns that came into focus, and presented as eight narratives, showed that the main concern for all nurses was to keep the patient safe, and ensure they worked to their Scope of Practice. This narrative research study has provided the unique and individual perspectives related to direction, delegation and accountability relevant to nurses in clinical workplaces, education, leadership and management settings. Significant implications for nursing practice, research, policy design, the theory taught in nursing education programmes, and access to in-service information sessions were identified.",,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/13677",,,,"en","English",,,,"University of Canterbury",,,,,,,"http://library.canterbury.ac.nz/thesis/etheses_copyright.shtml","All Rights Reserved",,,,,,,,,,,,"Nurses storied experiences of direction and delegation",,,"Electronic Thesis or Dissertation",,,"Health Sciences","University of Canterbury",,"Doctoral",,,"Doctor of Philosophy",,"2489164",,,"College of Education, Health and Human Development, University of Canterbury",,"Margaret.hughes@ara.ac.nz",,,,,,,,,"Professor Ray Kirk"

Research suggests that these families are at increased risk for child behavioral and academic difficulties, mental health issues, and other psycho-social challenges. Within military families, extended periods of separation are relatively common, but are also compounded by additional risks that accompany a military deployment. The present study employed a cross-sectional mixed-methods research design to examine adaptations that occurred across the deployment cycle in a sample of 28 military couples (with at least one child), who had recently experienced a deployment. Quantitative analyses showed that the military parents found the post deployment period more challenging than the pre deployment period, while the home parents rated the deployment period as the most challenging. Additionally, a number of interesting associations were found; for example, increased military risk during deployment was linked with higher relationship satisfaction and reduced mental health challenges after deployment. Qualitative analyses supported these interesting findings and provided examples of common resilience factors across these families along with additional indicators of how these military families adapted to separation and reunion.

"3316","10092/806",,,"Nixon, Julia Anne",,,,,,,,"2005",,,"It has been recognised for many years that competent reading occurs only after a number
of component skills have been mastered. Many studies propose that a lack of phonemic
awareness underpins many of the difficulties children experience in learning to read. A
recent study, however, has suggested that 8 to 9-year old children who are struggling with
reading may be hampered more by poor decoding fluency rather than by inadequate
phonemic awareness. While many component skills of reading have been the focus of
research, there is scant research into interventions designed to build decoding fluency
directly. The present experiment attempted to increase decoding fluency in five, eight and
nine-year old low-progress readers using direct teaching techniques. In addition, the project
aimed to ascertain how long it would take to build decoding fluency and, once increased,
whether the improvement would generalise to faster prose reading. Analysis of the results
showed that it is possible to build decoding fluency directly and that faster decoding
generalises to faster prose reading. These findings have significant implications for both the
diagnosis of reading difficulties in eight and nine-year old children and the teaching of
children who are having difficulty in learning to read.",,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/2946",,,,"en",,,,,"University of Canterbury.

"3281","10092/806",,,"Harrison, Jane",,,,,,,,"2003",,,"This thesis explores the negotiations of motherhood identity of four Pakeha
New Zealand mothers. During unstructured group interviews the four women
were asked to talk about their experiences as mothers and the
representations of motherhood they encountered in popular culture. Rather
than focus on media texts, the research was designed to explore the
embeddedness of media reception in these mother's everyday lives. The
death of Princess Diana part way through the research process provided an
illuminating example of the differences between discussions of media texts
and those of everyday mothering practices. Three sites of analysis were
examined - the embodied experience of pregnancy, birth and breastfeeding;
the home and family; and the institutional encounters these four women
described. The women engaged in a complex and contradictory process of
constructing their identities as mothers against the powerful regulatory
processes of the Good Mother discourse identified in the media and
throughout the culture. Identity construction involved both compliance and
resistance to the Good Mother discourse, often requiring a careful positioning
of each woman as a Good Mother in relation to other mothers. The
disjuncture between the ideological representations of motherhood and the
lived daily practices of mothering produced resistance, most clearly in the
shape of rejecting the Idealised Nuclear Family by choosing to mother alone
rather than remaining in unhappy relationships. Powerful constructions of
childhood remained largely unquestioned,however, creating a motherhood
workload that was exhausting and marked by feelings of guilt and anxiety.
The increasingly unstable and contested nature of family life in New Zealand
today brings with it the possibility of new definitions of motherhood, family and
childhood that may allow mothers like these to construct new meanings of the
Good Mother that more closely reflect their own lives.",,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/2884",,,,"en",,,,,"University of Canterbury.

"3236","10092/806",,,"O'Regan, Bridget",,,,,,,,"2006",,,"Senior educators in Samoa who are currently studying towards a Master of Teaching and
Learning degree through the Christchurch College of Education face the usual range of
challenges encountered by students studying from a distance. In addition, they face a range
of expectations from their jobs, their communities, their churches and their families that are
not the norm in the western society through which they are studying. Despite such
difficulties, these educators are successful and are leaders in their fields. I was interested to
learn how they managed these challenges. This thesis therefore asks, How did a group of
senior educators in Samoa undertake their educational journeys'! It also traces my cultural
and research learning journeys and the pathways I followed as a palagi (white person)
undertaking cross-cultural research.
It was important that I recognise my limitations as a palagi conducting research in the
Pacific and that as far as possible I followed practices and research methodologies sensitive
to Pasifika contexts. I therefore adopted a holistic and collaborative approach that entailed
consultation with the community throughout the research process. During initial
consultation community members confirmed they wished the research to occur, and that
they approved of and accepted me as the researcher. We worked collaboratively to
determine the topic and the nature of the study. The community drew clear parameters and
established the main emphasis of the research as a narrative approach within an
ethnographic framework. Ongoing consultation included regular visits to Samoa to meet
with the participants where we discussed progress and worked together to co-construct their
stories.
My research approach 0 auala i le fa'a Pasefika (Pasefika Pathways) guided me throughout
the research. This approach, a combination of my own western social constructionist
epistemology, Talanoa research methodology and Stephen Filipo's (2004) research
approach 0 auala i le fa'a Samoa, enabled me to respect and value my participants while at
the same time taking cognisance of the cultural limitations under which a palagi works. I
was given cultural guidance and support by an advisor in New Zealand appointed by the
College of Education. The participants voluntarily took on the role of cultural advisors
during my time in Samoa.
I gathered data through a combination of fono (interviews), and talanoa (informal
conversations) conducted in Samoa, and supplemented this with data from the participants'
journals and from my own research journal,
I realised from an early stage that various aspects of the research such as the processes
used, cultural aspects and the main themes drawn from the participants' stories were
closely intertwined and difficult to separate. Consequently, I adopted the metaphor of an
ietoga (fine mat) to present this thesis. The completed ietoga represents the participants'
individual educational journeys together with my cultural and research learning journeys.
I argue that the participants live between two worlds as they balance tensions between the
requirements of the western institutions that provide their education and the requirements
of fa'a Samoa. The participants' formal schooling did not take account of fa'a Samoa and
its related values. Nor did it take account of Pasifika people's preference for oral and
experiential learning. Codes of behaviour and expectations of fa'a Samoa such as fa'a aloalo
(respect) for one's elders and those in authority have markedly constrained and influenced
the participants' educational journeys. Their responsibilities to family, church and
community, for example, have presented barriers to their success. Paradoxically, these
same codes of behaviour and expectations have supported the participants and have made it
possible for their educational journeys to be successful.
I contend that if western institutions wish to provide meaningful programmes and learning
experiences for their Pasifika students, it is important that they take cognisance of and plan
for these students' cultural values, beliefs and codes of behaviour.
This research determined factors that enabled a group of senior educators in Samoa to be
successful. Two questions arise for me and present as opportunities for research to be
undertaken by Samoan or other Pasifika peoples. Have the participants been successful in
their postgraduate study because they are undertaking this while living in Samoa and
therefore have ready access to fa'a Samoa's support systems? How have the participants'
educational journeys differed from those of other educators who have not achieved the
same success?",,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/2841",,,,"en",,,,,"University of Canterbury.

Through framing the research within kaupapa Māori methodology and employing Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis, four superordinate themes were identified: Rangatiratanga (advocacy, leadership and commitment); Kotahitanga (working together with whānau); Whanaungatanga (maintaining connections with whānau); and Manaakitanga (caring for Māori students’ learning and potential).  These findings closely align with a Māori worldview (Ritchie, 1992), and Macfarlane’s educultural wheel (2004).

"10783","10092/806",,,"Nordin, Hasniza",,,,,,,,"2014",,,"Information and communication technologies (ICT) are common in schools worldwide in the 21st century, in both developed and developing countries. A number of initiatives have been made in the development of ICT related training in Initial Teacher Education (ITE) programmes. These initiatives aim to develop future teachers’ ability to teach and deliver the school curriculum, including using ICT in the classroom. Sufficient field experience is essential since the process of undergoing such placements would prepare them in creating new ideas and implementing strategic ways as to how they can effectively incorporate the use of ICT in their lesson plan, class management, and in teaching.

The key research question in this study is “Do pre-service teachers in a New Zealand and a Malaysian ITE programme use their field experience to develop their potential to integrate ICT in schools and, what are the similarities and differences between these case studies?” Effective use of ICT in teaching and learning requires the teacher to understand how ICT weaves with pedagogy and content. The Technological, Pedagogical Content Knowledge (TPACK) theoretical framework introduced by Mishra and Koehler (2006) clarifies the need to understand and develop TPACK to inform integration of ICT in teaching. 

This research provides two case studies of ICT in ITE in the Asia Pacific region, one in a developed country, New Zealand, and the other in a developing country, namely Malaysia. Both case studies are of ICT in an ITE programme with a particular focus on field experience in secondary schools, within which there are embedded cases of ITE students. This study illustrates how pre-service teachers’ experience and development of ICT knowledge and skill and their understanding of TPACK can support an increase in their teaching competencies. This research provides evidence that field experience is important to support pre-service teachers to develop their teaching competencies with ICT and understanding of TPACK in ways that are transferable into their own practice. This study has also contributed to increased reliability and validity of TPACK instrumentation. The comparative findings of the New Zealand and Malaysian case studies indicate the importance of a range of contextual factors, which suggest that the Initial Teacher Education programme, school curriculum and ICT availability as well as student maturity contribute to the development of TPACK.",,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/9856",,,,"en",,,,,"University of Canterbury.

In New Zealand, the Virtual Learning Network enables students from more than 250 schools to experience blended learning, by enrolling in blended distance courses in addition to the face-to-face courses that their home schools offer. More and more teachers across the country also implement online content in their face-to-face teaching, experimenting with a variety of tools and offering blended web-enhanced courses to their students. The rollout of Ultra Fast Broadband is expected to increase the uptake of blended approaches in schools across the country. School wide implementation of blended teaching learning is expanding, but it is challenging even for schools that have been part of a rural e-learning cluster for many years. The need to investigate how blended teaching and learning is implemented in schools is increasing to identify the implications for students, teachers, school leaders and other educational stakeholders.
A case study methodology was applied to investigate how blended teaching and learning was implemented in 2011 in a New Zealand rural secondary school that was one of the early adopters of blended approaches. Data collection methods included interviews with the ePrincipal of the school’s e-Learning cluster, the school principal and six teachers using blended approaches, observations in one blended web-enhanced class, group interviews with six students from the same class, as well as a review of documents and web resources.
The findings focus on the uptake of blended teaching and learning at the school, the support that the school received from its e-Learning cluster and the support the school offered to teachers. School leaders’ and teachers’ vision for student learning was also examined, along with teachers’ practices with blended approaches, the advantages and challenges that participants observed and/or experienced, as well as the school’s future directions regarding blended teaching and learning.
The study is the first to apply Davis’s (2008, in press) arena of change with digital technologies in education to present the complexity of change with blended teaching and learning in a secondary school. The roles of multiple stakeholders and their organizations impacting on and being impacted by the development of blended teaching and learning, including students, teachers, other teaching staff, school leaders, parents/community, professional, commercial/OER (Open Educational Resources), bureaucratic and political organizations are discussed.

This study follows previous research by Stuart (2011) on children attending ECE Centres. The objective of the current study was to examine the architecture of naps in infants who were transitioning to attendance at an ECE Centre. Four males and one female aged between 4 and 11 months contributed to five case studies. Digital video recordings were made of participants napping in two settings: the home and the ECE Centre. Baseline recordings were made in the home only, and recordings were made in both settings as infants transitioned to the ECE Centre, and once they were deemed to be “settled” at the centre. The recordings were then coded to determine sleep states and amount of caregiver interaction. The results showed that all infants displayed a reaction to the transition to ECE attendance. However, the transition to the ECE Centre had a minimal effect on most infants’ home naps. Overall, naps were longer and more efficient at home than at the ECE Centre, and infants engaged in more Active Sleep than Quiet Sleep in both settings. Caregiver interaction during naps also differed between the settings. This is an important area of study as attendance at ECE Centres in New Zealand is increasing (Ministry of Education, 2011b), and as such, suggestions for future research have been made.",,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/7369",,,,"en",,,,,"University of Canterbury.

"9521","10092/806",,,"Hurford, Leigh Hannah Margaret",,,,,,,,"2013",,,"The New Zealand Government recognises the importance of supporting all students in their learning to assist them to reach their full potential.  This recognition is inclusive of gifted and talented students.  Furthermore, boards of trustees, through their principal and staff, are required under the National Administration Guidelines, to demonstrate how they are catering for gifted and talented students.  Notwithstanding this requirement, The Education Review Office (2008) report entitled Schools’ Provision for Gifted and Talented Students, confirms that a major challenge for school leadership is sustaining momentum of gifted and talented provisions and programmes.  

Despite this mandated intent, what happens in practice at the school level remains problematic.  Teachers and schools welcomed the Talent Development Initiative (TDI), a Ministry of Education (MOE) Initiative, as it held some promise for developments in gifted and talented education.  The first round of the initiative ran between 2003 and 2005 and the second from 2006 to 2008.  Funding to support innovation and special developments in gifted education has been provided to 38 programmes nationwide.  This initiative serviced some schools and educational bodies but a large number of others were left without an extra layer of support beyond their schools’ leadership actions.  

This study focuses on the school level, in particular teachers who are given additional responsibility, namely those with a coordination role.  Moreover, my thesis is about how work to meet the needs of gifted and talented students can be sustained in schools to ensure the gifted and talented ‘torch’ can continue to ‘burn brightly’ over time.  

To gain an understanding of coordinators’ insights on what it takes to overcome the problem of sustaining provisions and programmes, this study adopts a qualitative, case study approach.  I selected a purposive sample of six teachers with experience working in a gifted and talented coordinator role.  The main source of data collection was individual semi-structured interviews (refer to Appendix A).  I asked them questions about their role and how provisions were made for gifted and talented students at their schools.  Further questions were asked about the support they received for their roles, particularly professional learning and development to enhance their practice.   
 
My findings show the responses from participants highlighted the important connection between leadership and learning.  Knowledge and passion to do their best for gifted and talented students, although important, was not sufficient.  The leadership actions and support provided by others in their setting and beyond their setting were likewise needed.

My analysis revealed a range of strategies was deemed necessary to support the leadership of learning in classrooms, specifically the need for dialogue amongst teachers about identification, planning and evaluating provisions and programmes.  All too often these gifted and talented coordinators worked alone in their roles, in isolation from others, and at times without the support they needed.  Thus the success or failure of provisions and programmes for gifted and talented students rested on their ongoing commitment and drive. 

My study includes recommendations for practice.  These recommendations suggest that provisions for gifted and talented students must be integrated into curriculum delivery and learning areas and be part of schools’ cultures in order for them to take hold and be sustained over time.  Furthermore, there is a need to develop clarity of these provisions through job descriptions and for schools to undertake regular if not annual reviews of written documentation to guide ongoing work in gifted and talented education.",,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/8670",,,,"en",,,,,"University of Canterbury.

It is uncommon for users of these terms (educators, policy makers and researchers) to make their understandings and use of such terms explicit. In the absence of close and careful critique, limited and partial understandings of groups of learners constructed as diverse and different escape interrogation. The overall risks of this lack of conceptual clarity are: simplification and even misapprehensions of key dimensions of groups such as Pasifika learners and their communities. This results in unarticulated assumptions having undue influence over educators’, policymakers’ and researchers’ perspectives and their subsequent decision-making. The philosophical research questions of this study are addressed through a deconstructivist research framework that draws on the theorisations of J.R. Martin; M. Foucault’s theorisations relating to the historical analysis of ideas; and discourse theorising of a primarily post-structuralist nature. Six analyses were developed in order to address the research questions. Three focused on the level of national policies, macro-level influences, and post-colonial indigenous visioning. Three analyses are based on a selection of narrative accounts of Samoan women across time and space, examining education as a process of change, and its effects on personal identity and culture. The study critically reflects on the underlying values and belief systems of both policy and practice. It identifies and examines the tension between the state’s priorities for the provision of education for Pasifika peoples on the one hand, and Pasifika peoples’ motivations for pursuing and participating in education on the other. This is done in an effort to challenge complacency, provide alternative perspectives, deepen insights and strengthen understandings amongst those actively engaged as educators, policy makers and researchers in the education and development of Pasifika peoples in Aotearoa New Zealand.",,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/8731",,,,"en",,,,,"University of Canterbury.

The benefits of raising the achievement of Māori students have a wide range of positive outcomes for the whole country. In the last ten years many schools have been engaged in initiatives designed to improve the success of Māori learners; but does this work continue when the support and funding is no longer there?

This research is designed to identify factors that can sustain these initiatives. Organisational culture creates the conditions in schools so they can continually develop and evolve. But in 21st century society this can happen in complex ways, so schools and their leaders need to understand how to manage that complexity. Leadership is a crucial part of this process, but it is not traditional styles of leadership that are required but new types such as adaptive and authentic leadership. These styles of leadership rely on building relational trust through clear communication and actions which engage and empower others.

The recommendations form a framework for school leaders to create a successful organisational culture which could be applied to improving the performance of Māori, but it could also be applied to other school change initiatives.",,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/9320",,,,"en",,,,,"University of Canterbury.

"10432","10092/806",,,,,"Stanley, Faye Tucker",,,,,,"2014",,,"In many ways, traditional arts in schools bear the bruises of the early years of multicultural education, and the failed practices that created what has been termed a tourist curriculum, comprised of the superficial study of folktales, festivals, foods, and facts.  Consequently, the use of art forms of cultures is often approached with caution by teachers, or avoided altogether.
   This thesis re-frames the use of traditional arts in the classroom through current research and knowledge, defining their efficacy and role in today’s classroom. Traditional arts are examined through the lenses of arts integration, culturally responsive pedagogical practice and creative processes. A qualitative, research portraiture methodology was employed, and executed through the lens of four case studies in order to more coherently incorporate the arts-based nature of this research. The research sites include classes studying Maori visual arts, waiata (song), and haka (dance) in Christchurch, New Zealand, chant, hula, and plant weaving at an Hawaiian charter school, and social dance and song of the Oneida tribe in the US.
   Research results indicated that when teachers facilitate experiences in traditional arts in such a way that students are exposed to entry points for their own interaction with the forms, students respond with self reflection, engagement, and a tendency to elevate the status of affiliation with the culture undertaken. While students and teachers do not become conversant in the culture as a result of such study, working with traditional arts in this way may serve to break down culturally bound ways of seeing the world.
When traditional arts are employed in classrooms, they may engage students in a creative process that takes the form of embodied or physicalized, interpretive, or improvisational interactions with the forms. 
   When traditional arts are employed in this way, relying on creative process, they also meet goals for culturally responsive learning, legitimizing how students experience and make sense of the world.
   Traditional arts provide a critical, under-utilized, strategy for embedding culture in the educational setting. In order to best meet the goals of the learning setting, traditional arts must incorporate creative processes. Hybridization of the forms, while increasing accessibility for teachers and students, must be carefully undertaken. Traditional arts utilized in this way hold potential for addressing broader curricular content.",,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/9471",,,,"en",,,,,"University of Canterbury.

"11137","10092/806",,,"Ray, Barbara Elizabeth",,,,,,,,"2014",,,"When a child is identified as deaf, intervention services typically focus on parents and the deaf child.  In New Zealand and globally, little has been written about the experiences of hearing siblings when there is a deaf child in the family.  We know very little about how sibling relationships might be affected when one child is deaf (Marschark, 1997).  It is still unclear whether hearing siblings experience negative affects when there is a deaf child in the family or whether relationships with deaf siblings are warm and close with a special understanding.

This study had five main objectives.  The first objective was to examine the experiences of hearing siblings who had either grown up with a deaf sibling or whose sibling had lost their hearing later in life.  The second objective was to consider the influence that parents and extended family members had on the hearing/deaf sibling relationship.  The third objective was to establish whether society’s perceptions of disability complemented the sibling/family’s perceptions and what impact, if any, this had on the hearing/deaf sibling relationship.  The fourth objective was to determine whether hearing siblings and their families formed connections with the Deaf community and what those connections involved.  The fifth objective was to triangulate the data and establish whether there was commonality between the views of hearing siblings, Resource Teachers of the Deaf and Advisers on Deaf children. 
   
This study employed a mixed methods research design.  Six hearing siblings aged between 18 to 65 years living in a city in the South Island of New Zealand were interviewed.  Six Advisers on Deaf Children and six Resource Teachers of the Deaf from both the North and South Islands of New Zealand completed a survey based on the findings from the interviews. 
  
The qualitative findings revealed that hearing siblings view their deaf sibling as typical and normal and it is only when they step outside the immediate family that they develop an awareness of disability.  Furthermore, society for the most part continues to view disability or difference in a less than positive light.  Significantly, the study’s findings reveal that hearing siblings make a substantial and enduring contribution to the lives of their deaf siblings yet they continue to be overlooked by professionals and wider society.  Accordingly, it is recommended that educators, professionals and agencies begin to actively involve hearing siblings in the services they provide to families of deaf children including hearing siblings attending Individual Education Plan (IEP) meetings, Keeping in Touch (KIT) Days and Deaf Awareness Week events held in special and mainstream schools.",,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/9931",,,,"en",,,,,"University of Canterbury.

"10829","10092/806",,,,,"Aman, Amira",,,,,,"2014",,,"There is a wealth of literature on the induction and support of provisionally registered teachers (Boreen, 2009; Bubb, 2007; Cameron, Lovett, & Garvey Berger, 2007) and the key skills of mentoring (Achinstein & Athanases, 2006; Glickman, 2002). However literature on how to meet the professional learning needs of curriculum leaders developing their mentoring skill set has largely been ignored in leadership literature. This study, informed by MacBeath and Dempster’s (2009)concept of ‘leadership for learning’, upholds the need for leadership work to focus on the improvement of student outcomes (Barber & Fullan, 2005) rather than traditional approaches to education which focussed on making resources available to students. In an outcomes-focussed model of education, the needs of the students are at the forefront of all learning. By focussing on teachers’ professional learning through mentoring and the use of a teacher inquiry model, the students’ learning needs are prioritised. 

The focus for my study is the skillset of curriculum leaders for their work with teachers within their learning areas. The participants for this study were five curriculum leaders, all from the same secondary school. This intervention study investigated the factors which contributed to the professional learning of the mentors, their views of their leadership role and the kinds of learning about mentoring which were beneficial to understandings about mentoring. By focussing on key adult learning principles, structures that support learning, and attention to a mentoring skill set, the participants were supported to develop their mentoring skills. The mentors participated in a professional learning experience, referred to as a Quality Learning Circle (QLC), over one and a half school terms, to co-construct their understanding of mentoring practice. In a QLC the focus is on the learners seeking and making changes to their practice in a collaborative, supportive environment (Lovett & Verstappen, 2003). 

The mentors collaboratively developed new understandings through deliberate talk in the QLC about their shared interest in mentoring. They also had opportunities for immediate and practical application of their new knowledge. While they participated in the QLC they co-currently developed their mentoring skills by working with a mentee who taught in the same subject area as themselves. 

This study features a qualitative methodology with an interpretive case study of experienced curriculum leaders. Data collection tools included a gap analysis survey which explored their understandings of their school’s current professional learning opportunities. A second data source was a career questionnaire which explored their teaching history and experiences of professional learning. This was followed by initial interviews which focussed on how they interpreted their role of a curriculum leader and the extent they could connect leadership with students’ learning. I also analysed transcripts of QLC meetings, and the teachers’ reflective journals. Four of the mentors worked with a provisionally registered teacher (PRT), while one mentor chose to work with a more experienced colleague. 

This study offered a new type of collegial interaction for the teachers. The mentors chose their own goals, a mentee to work alongside and the direction of their learning about mentoring.  The QLC met five times during the study and the mentors and participant researcher (PR) also kept a reflective journal. In between the QLC sessions the mentors met with their mentees to practise their mentoring skills, such as questioning skills, and the use of observational tools for classroom observations. A typical QLC session focussed on each of the mentors talking about the mentoring practice they had undertaken. The group provided support and guidance on possible next steps of practice. Readings and practical resources were also discussed and there was an expectation that the mentors would practice an aspect of mentoring and report back to the group at the next meeting. At the close of the study the mentors were re-interviewed to compare their views of their leadership role and learning from their initial interviews.  An iterative process was used so that emerging understandings of the data could arise. The data is presented according to the three broad themes of ‘effective professional learning’, ‘leadership role’ and ‘professional learning about mentoring’.

The findings of this study highlight the importance  of collaborative learning opportunities for teachers where they can state and resolve practical issues in a supportive group (Cochran-Smith, Feiman-Nemser, McIntyre, & Association of Teacher Educators., 2008). Among all of the findings there were four major findings about the development of curriculum leaders’ mentoring skills: the value of opportunities for deliberate talk, the importance of teacher agency, the need for specific tools in developing mentoring practice, and the necessity of understanding the curriculum leaders’ leadership role.  

My detailed account of the experiences of the five curriculum leaders offers a practical example of what the development of curriculum leaders’ understandings of mentoring might look like. This study serves to highlight the challenges for schools to provide support for teachers wanting to take responsibility for their own professional learning. In the absence of any formalised leadership professional learning about mentoring for curriculum leaders, this study proved to be a useful study to demonstrate the potential of the QLC approach to support curriculum leaders in their understandings and practice of mentoring. The key findings of this study validate the need for further research on what is needed for effective mentoring to be an integral part of every school.",,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/9743",,,,"en",,,,,"University of Canterbury.

"11480","10092/806",,,"Dunn, Katana",,,,,,,,"2015",,,"This thesis explores the use of an online robotics course, in the context of Technology Education, for senior secondary school students in an urban New Zealand (NZ) school. The reasons for using an online course are discussed through investigating the need for quality resources to assist schools in providing students with appropriate learning experiences, and knowledge to enable them to make informed choices with respect to technology careers. There is a shortage of students pursuing technology careers and that in turn influences the NZ economy (Baron & McLaren, 2006).

The purpose of the study was to examine how an online robotics course can be used for teaching robotics and engaging students in a blended environment. The author planned, implemented, monitored and reviewed an online course in robotics through an action research approach using formative evaluation methods to determine the effectiveness of the individual action research cycles. After reflection at the end of each AR cycle, the online course was modified and updated to improve student engagement. Qualitative methods were used to analyse online discussions, classroom observations and discussions, and one to one interviews with the participants. 

Research findings identified four themes that influenced student engagement with the online robotics course: access to the online course, the students’ background knowledge and skills, the students’ interaction with the online course and the students’ conation or internal motivation. The research findings are discussed in terms of areas that need to be addressed when using an online course to teach robotics. These areas are the course design, student considerations and course implementation. Course design, or how the course is structured, includes opportunities for students to develop their thinking skills, experiences and activities for learning, and opportunities for conversation and interaction. Course design must also accommodate student considerations. Student considerations focus on the needs of the learners and their readiness to ensure successful engagement in the online course in terms of their background knowledge and skills in electronics and Web 2.0 tools, their conation and their key competencies. Course implementation includes the factors that need to be taken into account in the execution of the online course such as reliable access to the online course, the students’ interactions with the online course, and the learning culture of the school and classroom, and the role of the teacher. 

The thesis justifies the rational for using an online robotics course and describes how an online robotics course can address and advance student learning outcomes, how online tools can be used for assessment purposes, the aspects of course design that are successful for teaching robotics and online learning experiences that provide positive outcomes for students. Recommendations for teaching practice in terms of school-wide programmes to develop and support students’ digital literacy and key competencies, and teacher professional development in Technology Education and online robotics courses are provided. Suggestions for future research are given in terms of student conation, the development of critical thinking skills through forums and how teachers’ philosophies can be aligned to Technology Education and the intent of the NZ Curriculum.",,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/10281",,,,"en",,,,,"University of Canterbury.

The aim of this qualitative study was to explore the coping strategies of children with adequate self-regulation skills and minimal behaviour problems, living in Christchurch following the major 2010 and 2011 earthquakes. This aim was achieved through the use of semi-structured interviews with five seven-year-old children, their parents, and their teachers. These interviews were analysed using Directed Content Analysis and results showed that children most often reported using active and adaptive coping strategies, followed by avoidant strategies. Results in the current literature regarding children’s coping suggest that children exposed to natural disasters are able to utilise strategies that involve some personal control over their environment and emotions, through the use of active and adaptive coping strategies. Findings from this study contribute to the current understanding of children’s use of coping strategies when faced with commonly occurring childhood upsets.

"15842","10092/806",,,,"Denston, Amanda Joy",,,,,,,"2016",,,"Understanding the challenges that students with literacy learning difficulties (LLD)
face in their psychosocial development should be a fundamental focus for teaching
practitioners and researchers. While success in literacy development is acknowledged to be
integral, not only to success within the educational context but also to how individuals
navigate through local and global society, less attention has been paid to the difficulties in
psychosocial development that often accompany difficulties in literacy development. The
pervasive nature of LLD can influence students’ ability to positively adapt to stressors within
their lives. While research has typically focused on the remediation of psychosocial
development and literacy development as separate entities, other research has targeted
psychosocial development via the remediation of literacy difficulties. The current research
adds to existing literature by examining the association between psychosocial and literacy
development via an academic intervention in students with LLD.
The primary focus of the current research was whether the psychosocial development
of students with LLD in Year 4 to Year 6 (U. S. Grades 3 to 5) could be affected via a
targeted literacy intervention. Study 1 included instruction in general literacy skills, focusing
primarily on decoding and fluency in reading text at or above the reading level of the student.
Study 2 and Study 3 further included specific instruction in morphological and orthographic
awareness. The effectiveness of the targeted intervention at improving students’ literacy
development was assessed, along with changes in measures of self-esteem, self-efficacy, and
resilience. Findings supported the notion that psychosocial and literacy development of
students with LLD could be positively influenced via such targeted interventions. However,
gains in self-efficacy and resilience seem to be dependent on the levels of resilience at preintervention.
Interventions that aim to positively impact on psychosocial, as well as, literacy levels in children with poor literacy acquisition; therefore, may need to be considered against
the child’s existing psychosocial development.",,,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/13043",,,"en","English",,,,"University of Canterbury",,,,,,,"http://library.canterbury.ac.nz/thesis/etheses_copyright.shtml","All Rights Reserved",,,,,,,,,,,,"Self-esteem and resilience in students with literacy learning difficulties within an educational context.","Theses / Dissertations",,,,,"Education","University of Canterbury",,"Doctoral",,,"Doctor of Philosophy",,"2406559",,,"College of Education, Health and Human Development, University of Canterbury",,"amandadenston@gmail.com",,,,,,,,,"John Everatt"
"15030","10092/806",,,,"Bae, Young Sil",,,,,,,"2016",,,"Educational policies have significant impacts on the lives of those involved,
silencing or strengthening one mode of pedagogy over others in society. The way that
issues are re/presented within policies limits what is considered to be desirable or
even possible in society (Bacchi, 2000). Consequently, looking into how a certain
issue is problematised and framed in policies invites individuals to unpack the
unspoken regulations and issues that derive from these policies. Drawing from
Bacchi’s ‘policy-as-discourse’ model, this thesis explores “what is unsaid yet present”
(Bacchi, 2004, p. 131) within the early childhood parenting programme, Incredible
Years [IY].
For its wealth of evidence and science-based strategies, IY has been chosen and
implemented by many countries as an official parenting programme ‘to prevent and to
treat’ children’s conduct problems. The aim of the programme is to equip ‘high risk’
parents with behaviour management skills and developmentally appropriate
techniques, so that they can provide better support for their children’s development of
social and emotional competence and school readiness. Presenting reports of various
clinical trials as evidence, the developers and the supporters of IY argue that the
programme is an efficient tool to prevent “predictable negative consequences” such as
violence, delinquency, and substance abuse among such child/ren in adolescence and
adulthood (Borden, Schultz, Herman, & Brooks, 2010, p. 223). This argument,
however, needs more thorough consideration, because evidence-based approaches can
be criticised for the gap they leave in our knowledge of the reality of children’s and
families’ daily lives (Robertson, 2014). Whether IY does provide sufficient,
sustainable, and meaningful support for children and families, as trial reports suggest,
remains to be seen.
This thesis takes a post-structural, post-colonial, feminist approach, examining
what and how the issues are framed in IY through Foucault’s notion of
‘governmentality’ and ‘discursive normalisation’. By unpacking discourses of
parenting produced by IY as an accepted parenting programme, it aims to reveal the
‘norm’ of parenting that is promoted by the current system, and explores how this
concept of ‘truth’ in parenting influences the everyday life of families. This critical analysis shows that the IY policy privileges a scientific understanding of child rearing
practices while silencing and pathologising other ways of being. The discourses
produced in IY reinforce colonised, economic/neoliberal and scientific/clinical docile
bodies, which exercise and maintain the existing power relations in society. The
author argues that this notion of a curriculum for parents provides only a limited
understanding of the issue, and intensifies inequality and injustice.",,,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/12443",,,"en","English",,,,"University of Canterbury",,,,,,,"http://library.canterbury.ac.nz/thesis/etheses_copyright.shtml","All Rights Reserved",,,,,,,,,,,,"Is “Positive Parenting” really positive for children and families?

Four RMT practitioners in New Zealand were invited to nominate families who were willing to participate in one semi-structured interview. The collective voice of 14 parents captured their reasons for seeking additional help with their child’s development issues, finding RMT, using RMT within their family routine and their perceptions of the benefits they experienced and the costs, both financial and time, incurred. RMT is a programme which uses a series of movements to encourage the integration of retained primitive reflexes. While there is a small amount of research around movement programmes that target retained primitive reflexes, to-date there appears to be no empirical studies completed on RMT.
The parents in this study found that RMT was relatively easy to manage within their family routine and that it was a low-impact, cost-effective intervention with a range of perceived benefits for the child who had completed RMT.

found that even though the school was implementing PB4L-SW with strong fidelity,

there are different views about the chronological age of adolescence, there are agreements

supported by recent research on adolescent brain development that indicates that different

has the potential to inform the way that I can best counsel young adults.
In this research I describe a small research project in which I analysed transcripts of young

for 3-5 counselling sessions. In analysing the transcripts I found three key themes emerged.
These were: Transitioning Relationship with Parents; Self Awareness and Reciprocity in
Adolescent Relationships and Empathy and Values. Furthermore, I discovered ways that my
practice influenced the ability of clients to use the relationship question.
While some of the findings support the literature on characteristics of adolescents in
Western society, I propose that, when adolescents are invited to describe important

characteristics that challenge this literature. My hope is that through a social

"13472","10092/806",,,,"Wong, Wai Lam Heidi",,,,,,,"2015",,,"In English language classrooms, students use different approaches to carry out
English learning tasks. Language learning styles, which generally refers to learners’
preferred modes of language learning, have been widely researched and discussed in
the fields of second language acquisition (SLA) and educational psychology.
Understanding the learning style preferences of students can help teachers cope with
students’ course-related learning difficulties and ultimately help alleviate their
frustration levels. Another important concept is teaching styles, which refers to
teachers’ classroom behaviour based on their teaching beliefs, is commonly
associated with learning styles in language education research. Teaching style is vital
for providing students with good learning experiences and improving students’
academic outcomes.
This study explores the English language learning and teaching style preferences
in English for Academic Purposes (EAP) classrooms at community college level in
Hong Kong. The present study adopted a mixed method approach involving both
questionnaire surveys and semi-structured interviews, in attempt to investigate the
factors influencing learning styles and teaching styles, and the relationship between
them. It aims at providing valuable information for curriculum design and teacher
training in order to offer Hong Kong community college students adequate and
effective academic English language learning support.
A total of 637 students and 10 EAP teachers from two community colleges in Hong Kong participated in this research. The quantitative and qualitative findings of
this study show that the community college students in EAP classrooms have multiple
learning style preferences. A plethora of factors such as cultural and educational
backgrounds are related to their development of learning styles. This research also
explores the nature of teaching styles and the possible variables, including students’
English language proficiency and their learning styles, influencing their teaching
styles in EAP classrooms.
This study attempts to explain the relationship between learning styles and
teaching styles in English language classrooms with reference to the interview
findings from both students and teachers. It is argued that both learning styles and
teaching styles are flexible and have a reciprocal influence on each other. Learners
may adjust their learning styles in order to meet academic requirements, while
teachers may adjust their teaching styles so as to provide students with an affective
learning environment. When learners and teachers have more interaction with each
other, their styles may become similar to each other. This study also identifies the
importance of improving learners’ flexibility for developing learning styles and
accepting unfamiliar teaching styles.
Based on the evidence drawn from this research, educational implications on
teaching and learning in EAP classrooms, and recommendations for future research
on learning styles and teaching styles are proposed.",,,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/11661",,,"en","English",,,,"University of Canterbury",,,,,,,"http://library.canterbury.ac.nz/thesis/etheses_copyright.shtml","All Rights Reserved",,,,,,,,,,,,"A Study of Language Learning Style and Teaching Style Preferences of Hong Kong Community College Students and Teachers in English for Academic Purposes (EAP) Contexts","Theses / Dissertations",,,,,"Education","University of Canterbury",,"Doctoral",,,"Doctor of Philosophy",,"2132849",,,"College of Education, Health and Human Development, University of Canterbury",,"wailamheidiwong@gmail.com",,,,,,,,,"Professor Angus Hikairo Macfarlane"

""years of previous study"" and ""time spent in Japan"" were found to be significantly
related to achievement in Japanese and to level of integrative motivation. It was
also found that most of the students experienced difficulty in learning the audiolingual

consider the time allocated to perform the SENCO's duties as insufficient. Overall, the general
tenor of feeling toward the role of SENCO tends to be negative. However, a significant number

"3235","10092/806",,,"McGregor, Craig",,,,,,,,"2004",,,"From the middle of 2003 to the beginning of 2004, this research was carried out by Craig
McGregor, a student in the Master of Teaching and Learning Programme at the
Christchurch of College of Education. The purpose of the research was to investigate and
analyse an After School Study Centre that had been set up in a local school as part of a
New Zealand government initiative towards its policy of closing the digital divide
between less affluent and more affluent schools. This research used the Soft Systems
Methodology that was developed by Checkland and Scholes (1984, 1990, 1999) and
other writers. The purpose of the methodology was to provide suggestions for
improvement and change in the Study Centre. A further purpose of the research was to
explore and evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of the methodology. In general, the
research had the overriding aim of creating learning, both in the use of the methodology,
and about the Study Centre, rather than explanation.
A literature review charts the course from where systems thinking developed, and how
this developed into the Soft Systems Methodology. Such areas as components of
systems, development of systems theory, hard and soft systems, and Soft Systems
Methodology are discussed. Writers such as Carter, Martin, Mayblin, and Munday
(1984), Checkland and Scholes (1984, 1990, 1999), Davies and Ledington (1991), and
Dick (2002) are focused upon, with their own unique perspectives on systems thinking
and Soft Systems Methodology. Although the research started out by using the seven
step approach set out by Davies and Ledington (1991), it soon became quite clear that a
more holistic model for the methodology was needed to explain the various reiterations
that were required of several of the steps. As learning about the Study Centre developed,
previous steps in the methodology were revisited and refined. Checkland and Scholes
(1999) made it clear that this was how their own practice of the methodology had
developed in their 30 year perspective on their work, and refined their own model of the
methodology to a four stage approach.
In gathering data in the Study Centre, which was defined in the methodology as the
problem situation, participant observations and informal interviews were used. To
analyse this data, three main analytical techniques were used: an Intervention Analysis
looked at the data in terms of what potential problems had shown up as areas that could
require improvement or change; the Social and Cultural Analysis looked at the roles,
norms and values of the people who were identified as the ""actors"" in the Centre; a
Political Analysis looked at power and influence in the Centre. The information gained
from these analyses was set out in a ""Rich Picture"" as a holistic representation of the
Centre.
By using steps within the methodology, root definitions of three critical systems within
the Centre were created and checked against the mnemonic, CATWOE. The root
definitions are word statements that encapsulate the essence of the Homework
Completion System, Information Literacy System and the Infrastructure Maintenance
System. Through using systems thinking, and looking at the logically dependent
activities in the systems, models were created of how these three systems would operate
in an ideal world. A process was used to compare the ideal world models with how the
systems operated within the real world of the Study Centre. From this, recommendations
for improvement and change were developed. When discussing these recommendations
with the Principal and Centre Teacher, it was found that there was a high degree of
agreement on the changes that need to be implemented. The area that particularly needed
attention was in the Information Literacy Model, where the Principal felt that the
recommendations need to be instituted school wide. All of the comparisons revealed
recommendations need to be implemented in the control systems.
The discussion and conclusions section of the research looked at how effective the
methodology had been in providing the recommendations for improvement and change.
It was concluded that the actioning of the Soft Systems Methodology in the research
followed more in the model outlined by Dick (2002), where the methodology was
explained as a dialectic between four stages. While doing the Intervention Analysis, it
was discovered that not only was it useful to look at the problems from the angle of who
were the people who held a particular point of view, but also who held the point of view
as the most relevant point of view. The Political Analysis of the problem situation did
not show the full picture, and a diagram was developed that graphically showed the
informal and formal lines of influence. When checking the root definitions and models
against the CATWOE, it was found that the weltanschauung was the most difficult area
to incorporate. A model was developed within this research to create a typology of world
views that would help gain understanding of weltanschauung.
With the reporting back of the recommendations, although they were well received, it
was felt that a better disclosure was needed on how each suggestion was received. To
this end, a table was created to better explain the reactions to each of the
recommendations. In creating these recommendations as a starting point for discussion,
much thought had to be given to avoid value judgments that might be implicit in the
recommendations. Great care was taken to explain that the recommendations were a
starting point for discussion, not a value judgment as to how effectively the Centre was
operating. This was particularly important when explaining the need for control subsystem
activities within all of three of the systems. Care had to be taken to avoid the
inference that the suggested activities were low-trust devices.
The discussion also centred upon checking the validity of the research through looking at
what constitutes acceptable practice in systems modeling, and results of a similar
research. Parallels were also drawn between the SSM and Action Research, and SSM
and Futures Studies.",,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/2845",,,,"en",,,,,"University of Canterbury.

which intentionality judgements differentiate special
class children from those of equivalent IQ who remain in
regular classes. Despite criticism that adaptive behaviour
is a vague domain which presents serious measurement
difficulties, there has been considerable reaffirmation
of the importance of adaptive behaviour as a component of
mental retardation. Approximately 30% or less of children
within the 50-75 IQ range in New Zealand attend special
classes. It is thus apparent that factors in addition
to IQ are being used to determine special class placement.
Available research findings suggest that social
maladjustment is not inevitably linked with low intelligence
and some local research indicates that children placed
in special classes and those of equivalent IQ who remain
in regular classes differ in terms of their social adjustment.
The present study investigated the possibility that maturity
of intentionality judgements is associated with maturity
of social adjustment in mildly retarded children.
Twenty children attending special classes were matched
on age, sex and IQ with 20 children attending regular
classes. Subjects were administered individually the
AAMD Adaptive Behaviour (AB) Children's Form Part II,
and an intentionality judgement scale and transcripts were
made of the subjects' responses during testing.
As predicted, the special class children achieved
lower scores on the AB scale than did the regular class subjects thus indicating less adequate social adjustment
on the part of the special class children. More
significantly, the special class subjects achieved
significantly lower intentionality scores than did the
regular class subjects. It was thus concluded that
intentionality judgements differentiate special class
children from those of equivalent IQ who remain in
regular classes and that ability to take account of
intentions is associated with social adjustment in
mildly retarded children. The results were discussed in
terms of the criteria used for special class placement and
the possible effects of special class attendance.",,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/2847",,,,"en",,,,,"University of Canterbury.

Technology and Top  Of the South Island Technology) audio-graphic distance
learning projects provides description of when, why and how both projects came into
being. It also provides discussion of the issues and impacts connected to this
particular use of information communications technology in rural New Zealand
secondary schools. The study explores which elements were key to the design, to the
operation, and to the continuation of the projects. Data were collected using a range
of qualitative methods, including questionnaires and follow-up interviews with a
range of participants from both projects, and employs reference to various relevant
documents and literature.
Cantatech began in 1994 as CASAtech (Canterbury Area Schools Association
Technology group). The name was later changed to Cantatech when membership was
extended beyond just Area Schools to include other rural schools in the Canterbury
district. The initial project was followed closely by TOSItech which began a year
later in 1995. The inclusion of both projects in this study allows a little more insight
into the innovation process: there are many ways in which the pattern for
development was shared, but focusing on differences helps to suggest why Cantatech
continues to operate almost a decade later while TOSItech ceased to exist in half of
that time. The study may be of interest in particular to those involved in catering to
the educational needs of secondary students in isolated rural areas. It also has strong
links to the field of distance education, to the use of ICT in education, and to the
study of educational change and innovation.",,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/2869",,,,"en",,,,,"University of Canterbury.

"3245","10092/806",,,,,"Petrie, Kirsten",,,,,,"2002",,,"This study investigates how teacher beliefs, programmes and practices contribute to
gender construction, within co-educational secondary schools, in New Zealand. It
explores how physical education teaching practices support and reinforce socially
desirable forms of masculinity and femininity. The research utilises interviews with
teachers and students in co-educational secondary schools in the Canterbury region.
Students and teachers offer narratives surrounding the gendered beliefs and practices that
are inherent in physical education classes. The evidence presented represents the
collaborative ideas of four teachers and twenty students.
The discussion investigates the nature of teacher beliefs surrounding the development of
gender, and examines the hidden curriculum that supports the replication and
legitimisation of socially desirable forms of masculinity and femininity. In particular, it
examines teachers' understandings of masculinity and femininity, the hierarchies and
different expectations of achievement and behaviour that exist in physical education
classes. It examines how changes in physical education programmes, have challenged
explicit issues relating to gender, while hidden messages have not been addressed. Lastly
the discussion reflects on the reasons why gender constructions go unchallenged, and
provides insight into possible avenues to instigate change.
This research indicates how gender continues to be constructed due to the hidden
curriculum that is operationalised by teachers and students in physical education classes.
It suggests strategies that would assist in changing and challenging the gender
construction in physical education. Finally, the study concludes that in order for gender
construction to be reduced within from the physical education classroom the physical
education sector must strive to challenge existing ideologies and develop practices that
allow and provide for a diverse range of masculinities and femininities.",,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/2870",,,,"en",,,,,"University of Canterbury.

understanding of the difficulties encountered by foreign students in adjusting to a new

(NESB) Asian secondary full fee-paying students (SFFPS) boarding with
host families in Christchurch. Research was conducted by interviews and
questionnaires with secondary school students in Christchurch. Aspects of Asian
SFFPS living situations with host families that were investigated include the students'
country of origin, age, size of host families, age group of host families' children,
attitudes of the host families, host families' leisure life with students, students' social
life, meals with host families and host families level of support.
On the whole, the research suggests that Asian SFFPS boarding with host families lack
supervision and support. Interactions between Asian SFFPS and their host families,
local students and the local-community are infrequent. Many international students
lack a congenial learning environment, a decent living environment, a proper provision
of welfare support and a good relationship with the host culture and its people.
Interactions are important to develop greater communicative competence and more
confidence in the use of the English language in order to achieve wellbeing and multicultural linkage with New Zealand society as a foundation for later friendships.
The study concludes with a list of recommendations that might improve the Asian
SFFPS living situations. Interventionist strategies for intercultural interaction would I need to be introduced to promote more and better intercultural activities . Monitoring

According to the 2014/15 New Zealand health survey, people who lived in the most deprived areas were almost
two times more likely to be obese than those who lived in the least deprived areas.

Objectives: To assess the association between the area level deprivation and overweight/obesity prevalence
while controlling for demographic variables and health-related behaviours.

Method: The analyses were based on the health surveys conducted from 2002/03 to 2014/15 in New Zealand.
This study assessed area level deprivation using the New Zealand Deprivation Index. Proportional odds logistic
regression with sampling weights was used to answer the objective.

Results: Adults who lived in deprivation quintile five were more likely (OR 1.46, 95% CI 1.33–1.60) to be in the
higher Body Mass Index (BMI) tertiles compared with those who lived in quintile one, and the association was
stronger in children (OR 1.76, 95% CI 1.50–2.06). Pacific (OR 8.41, 95% CI 7.22–9.79) and M¯aori adults (OR
3.01, 95% CI 2.75–3.29) had a higher odds to be in the higher BMI tertiles compared with Europeans.

Conclusion: Based on the representative nationwide dataset, I found that higher deprivation quintiles were
significantly associated with a higher likelihood of being in the higher BMI categories after controlling for demographic
information and health behaviours. Public health interventions targeting obesity should take into account
the deprivation level and ethnic groups’ composition of the communities.",,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/14464",,,,"en","English",,,,"University of Canterbury",,,,,,,"http://library.canterbury.ac.nz/thesis/etheses_copyright.shtml","All Rights Reserved",,,,,,,,,,,,"The effect of area level deprivation on obesity in New Zealand: analysis of the New Zealand health surveys",,,"Electronic Thesis or Dissertation",,,"Health Sciences","University of Canterbury",,"Masters",,,"Master of Health Sciences",,,"2532806",,"College of Education, Health and Human Development, University of Canterbury",,"andrew.adiguna88@gmail.com",,,,,,,,,"Dr Arindam Basu"

the sleep states and patterns of the naps. The results indicated that the naps were individually
distinctive and varied across the children and across the environments. The majority of sleep
times were spent in quiet sleep compared to active sleep. The most consistent finding was
that the mean length of sleep (where sleep occurred during nap time) for each child was
longer in the home environment than the preschool environment. Caregiver behaviour across
the environments shared similarities. Children with sleeping difficulties were chosen for this
study as they represent a more challenging population for parents and teachers. It is possible
that the sleeping difficulties may have overridden the differences in sleeping environments.

Interest in the problems of Hong Kong orphans had been
initiated for the writer some years before there was any
knowledge of there being any orphans brought to New Zealand.
In the course of his work as Inter-Church Aid Secretary for
the East Asia Christian Conference, her husband had been many
times in Hong Kong, and had become deeply involved in the
relief of refugees, and in the varied personal problems of
adjustment attendant on such relief.
Thus when permission was granted by the New Zealand
Government in 1962 for the National Council of Churches and
the Immigration Committee of the Society of St. Vincent de
Paul to bring in fifty Hong Kong Orphans, consciousness of
some of the difficulties stimulated the desire to discover if
this scheme would bring lasting benefit to the orphans themselves,
and whether it would bring enrichment to the adoptive
families. Coupled with these questions was the desire to
consider the effect this form of immigration would , if
continued, on the life of New Zealand as a Whole.
It seemed that there were two areas in which study should
be undertaken:-
(a) The area concerned with the growth, development and
adjustment of Chinese orphan children to their New Zealand-European
adoptive families,
and
 (b) That area related to the interaction already taking
place in primary schools, between Chinese and European
children, in order to anticipate, as far as possible, the
future adjustment problems which the Hong Kong children would
encounter.
First, however, it is necessary to review the background
conditions in Hong Kong and in New Zealand, against which the
immigration took place.",,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/2941",,,,"en",,,,,"University of Canterbury.

ability, though few studies appear to have been made of
tertiary level writing skills. The present enquiry i~ an
attempt to determine whether students at the tertiary level
in two Arts departments differed in their adoption of
various techniques when writing essays as part of their
formal in-term coursework. Also the importance of various
essay features required by markers in the same two
departments is investigated.
Two studies were conducted. The principal study
focussed on 276 undergraduate students in the Education
and English Departments of the University of Canterbury
who were enrolled for first- and third-year courses in 1978.
Their responses to a 76 item Essay Writing Questionnaire
were scored and factor analysed yielding ten substantially
independent essay writing dimensions. Students' factor
scores on these dimensions were tallied and used in a series
of multivariate analyses of variance (MANOVAs) in order to
determine whether students varying in sex, age, status,
qualifications, subject taken and year at university
significantly differed in their adherence to the procedures
or attitudes represented by each of the essay writing
dimensions.
An ancillary, but complementary, study was conducted
which focussed on 12 staff members (six in each of the above
departments) responsible for marking the essays of the
students who participated in the main study. Their responses
to a nine question Marking and Significant Features of
Essays written by Undergraduate Students Questionnaire
were analysed by comparing their comments. Emphasis was
placed on their relative rankings of twenty positive
('ideal') and twenty negative ('inappropriate') essay
features in order to determine the extent of agreement among
the markers and between the departments regarding the
importance of the essay features.
The first study revealed several significant
differences on some of the essay writing dimensions between
the groups of students in their factor scores. Males rated
themselves higher than females on two factors, while females
rated themselves higher than males on two factors. Students
taking English rated themselves higher on one factor than
the Education students, while the Education students rated
themselves higher than the English students on three factors.
Students aged 21 or over rated themselves higher than those
aged 20 or below on five factors. A significant interaction
effect showed that a more highly qualified group of parttime
students rated themselves lower on four factors than a
less highly qualified group of part-time students. Some
reasons for these differences are discussed.
The second study indicated that staff in each
department appeared to emphasise certain essay features
more than others when compared to the other departments,
although there was a reasonable measure of agreement among
staff with respect to the importance of some essay features.
Staff findings are used to inform the student study,
particularly to assist interpretation of the differences
between Education and English students.

In the late 1980s and early 1990s traditional methods for assessing children were being significantly questioned.  The development in 1996 of Te Whāriki, the early childhood curriculum, signalled a re-form of assessment practices in the early years.  This reform involved a major shift in thinking and practice for teachers who worked in early childhood education.  The teachers in this study were already beginning to change their assessment practices to reflect learning dispositions and formative assessment.  This study focused on the theoretical and policy framework that reflected the shift toward teachers being encouraged to adopt these new ways for assessing children’s learning

Multiple sources of data collection included individual interviews, a group interview, an analysis of documents including relevant policies, staff meeting minutes and Learning Stories written by three of the teachers over a six-month period.  Findings revealed that the ways in which the teachers in this study made sense of, and used, the dispositional framework depended on how they viewed the purposes of assessment and their role as teachers. The study also explored some of the consequences of teachers adopting the dispositional framework when they were already experienced in other forms of assessment practice.  The significance of self-directed professional development was also highlighted.   Implications for management include the need to consider that the theoretical concepts associated with shifting from a developmental approach to a dispositional focus requires extensive time, resources and a team that is committed to change.",,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/3077",,,,"en",,,,,"University of Canterbury.

needs of past and present clients of a Stutterers' Clinic.
Incidence rates varied from 0.4 per cent to over
30 per cent according to the sub-population examined.
The overall incidence was 2.6 per cent. In general, the
older the sUb-population the higher the incidence of
disorders, and stutterers were evident in most of the subpopulations
screened.
It was concluded that many speech impaired adults in
the Christchurch metopolitan area receive no treatment for
their speech problems. It seems clear that while there are
insufficient speech/language therapists to treat all the speech impaired adults who would like to receive therapy,
the solution to the problem is more complex than simply
increasing the number of speech/language therapists. The
current situation appears to be not merely a lack of service
but a general paucity of information about the types of
disorders and the services available. The dissemination of
such knowledge to professionals, especially doctors, as well
as the general public and the speech impaired adults
themselves seems to be just as important as an increase in
staffing. Moreover, the location of future speech/language
therapy services should be carefully considered with special
regard for the 'needs' of the population it will serve.",,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/3512",,,,"en",,,,,"University of Canterbury.

"4105","10092/806",,,"Fox-Turnbull, Wendy",,,,,,,,"2003",,,"Technology Education was first introduced to the New Zealand curriculum in 1999.
Its introduction has provided challenges for teacher professional development
providers and teachers. Many teachers have had either little or no professional
development and therefore struggle to plan and implement programmes that reflect
authentic technological practice. Assessment of technology has been of particular
concern given the intense climate of accountability in schools. Because of its holistic
nature assessment practices must be an integrated part of students' technological
practice. My study addresses these problems by identifying authentic student
technological practice and discussing the teachers' role in teaching and assessing
their students. Teachers require quality professional development and an accurate
understanding of technological practice if they are to work effectively with students in
technology education.
The focus for this research is on one technology assessment task administered to Year
4 children in the National Education Monitoring Project (NEMP) 'Aspects of
Technology, 2000'. This is used as a framework to explore the challenges of making
assessment authentic in technology education. It is argued that the achievement
levels of the children can be improved if the task is a part of the technological
practice related to the field of study apparent in the task rather than a previously
unsighted 'out-of-context' task. It is also debated that for teachers to be able to plan
and implement a unit of work that is based on authentic technological practice they
must have a good understanding of the conceptual, procedural, technical and societal
knowledge relevant to the practice.
A three staged approach is used in this research. The first stage involved the selected
teachers in professional development exploring Learning in Technology Education
(LITE) research and unit planning strategies. For this purpose one NEMP task was
incorporated into a cooperatively planned unit of work. In Stage Two an 'out-of-context'
NEMP task was presented to six children from each of three of the six
schools, one in each decile band. In Stage Three the teachers were interviewed about
their intended practices. The unit of work was then taught in each of the six classes.
During the unit the task was again administered to six children in each class as an
integrated part of the unit. Both tasks were administered and analysed according to
the 'Aspects of Technology NEMP 2000' guidelines and criteria. This made it
possible to compare the 'out-of-context' task with the 'in-context' task. After the unit
was taught the teachers were interviewed again to discuss their actual practice.
Analysis of both sets of data allowed the comparison of achievement levels of children
participating in an isolated 'out-of-context' task to that, which was embedded in
authentic technological practice ('in-context').
The results showed that the children who attempted the task as an 'in-context' task
achieved at a higher level than those who completed the task as a previously
unsighted 'out-of-context' . task did My findings demonstrate that in order to gain a
realistic understanding of the levels of achievement in technology education through
assessment of technological outcomes, these outcomes should be an integral part of
authentic technological practice.
While the results indicate that assessment tasks need to be an integral part of
authentic technological practice this study acknowledges that students' technological
practice differs from that of real technologists. There are a number of reasons cited
for this to do with the age of the students, school politics and facilities, external
assessment requirements and the presence of the teacher in the role as mentor. The
study theorises that the quality of teacher knowledge impacts on the quality of
intervention given, altering students' technological practice. These ideas are
presented in a Model of Student Technological Practice.
The study concludes with recommendations for improving the pre-service training of
teachers and the up-skilling of existing teachers in technology education, and on the
organisation and development of national assessment tasks in technology education

"4109","10092/806",,,"Oughton, Tim",,,,,,,,"1999",,,"Before the introduction of Chemistry in the New Zealand Curriculum
(CINZC) in 1995 the teaching of chemistry in New Zealand schools had
largely been determined by School Certificate and Bursary examination
prescriptions and a national Sixth Form Certificate syllabus. The directive
given by the then Secretary for Education was that CINZC should provide the
basis for development of teaching programmes and that the Achievement
Aims and Objectives would be used in the development of future examination
prescriptions and alternative assessment systems. The major purpose of the
research presented in this thesis was to determine the extent to which CINZC
has influenced teaching approaches in schools, how useful the curriculum has
been to teachers, the level of support for the curriculum from teachers with
different backgrounds, and to determine the major barriers or tensions that
could affect successful implementation.
A questionnaire was sent to a sample of secondary schools throughout New
Zealand. The data collected were analysed and used to frame questions to be
used in comprehensive interviews with six Christchurch chemistry teachers.
The results indicated that, while a great majority of chemistry teachers agree
with the philosophy and intent of CINZC implementation had been only
partially successful in schools and several barriers existed, notably insufficient
time and inadequate written and human resources.
One very significant finding related to the differences in attitude and support
for CINZC by male and female respondents. Females were generally more
supportive and positive than their male counterparts. Differences between
teachers of different age groups, school gender and school size were less
notable.
Several recommendations are made as a result of these findings. The most
important immediate need is for a teacher's guide to be produced that fills in
the detail many teachers are seeking. Allied to this resource is the need for a
comprehensive teacher development programme to assist implementation.",,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/3640",,,,"en",,,,,"University of Canterbury.

how sport operates as a mechanism for gender replication. Placing the experiences
of a group of students at the centre of the research, I present an analysis to show
that the sports programme is a strategic site for the development of student
subjectivities. I employ a feminist theory of gender identity to argue that we have
no essential sense of self, that our ideas of femininity and masculinity do not
derive from nature but instead develop tlu'ough the discourses we encounter. I
examine how the students actively construct meanings of thentselves through the discourses surrounding their participation in sports. I explore the hierarchy or
gender order present and how the students position themselves within it. The
contribution that wider societal influences, such as the media, make to this process
is included in the analysis. I conclude that the institution of sport is a complex,
contradictory site full of tension and ambiguity and that, as agents of our own
subjectivities, there is the potential, in part through the insights outlined here, to
resist and/ or disrupt the discourses encountered and thereby challenge the

"4330","10092/806",,,"Davis, Keryn",,,,,,,,"2006",,,"This dissertation discusses how a team of teachers understand and practise assessment in the context of an early childhood centre. The early childhood sector has experienced raised expectations in terms of formal assessment in the decades since the education reforms of the late 1980s. These raised expectations have coincided with a shift in thinking about assessment, with the emergence of a new paradigm for assessment, and it is the combination of these that creates a number of tensions for practitioners in the sector. This shift in thinking in the early childhood sector' in this country has been shaped by changes to notions assessment, more universally. Educational assessment has been dominated by the positivist paradigm for over a century, however, as these positivist beliefs are questioned, a new paradigm has emerged for assessment, an interpretivist paradigm. For early childhood education in Aotearoa New Zealand this interpretivist paradigm sits comfortably with the sociocultural frame of Te Whariki. This dissertation considers the impact of these influences on the teachers of this study as they make meaning of assessment in their context. How the teachers made meaning of assessment \vas found to be influenced by both 'outsider' and 'insider' expectations. Though the teachers accommodated the requirements of assessment defined by 'outsider' expectations, they did so with minimal compromise of their own beliefs and values. In accommodating these requirements the teachers contained the most 'formal' aspects of assessment as they saw it, by limiting the extent to which these 'formal' procedures were followed or impacted on their day-to-day work with children, parents and each other. Instead, the teachers favoured approaches they identified as supporting their goals of building and maintaining strong relationships with children, parents and each other.",,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/3828",,,,"en",,,,,"University of Canterbury.

children's understanding of the four levels of authority; political,
positional, familial and peer. The Authority Picture-Story Measure
and three Structural Tasks (Serration, Class Inclusion, Multiplicative
Classification) were developed to assess children’s ability to recognize
the legitimate authority figure in a complex authority situation and
their ability to perform logical operations with authority concepts.
Thirty subjects at each of three age 1evels, 5, 8 and 11, were
administered the tasks in individual interviews.
Performance on the Authority measure increased significantly
(p<001) at age 8 and age 11. By age 8 children could recognize
the legitimate authority figure in a complex authority situation and
the type of authority, power or expertise, vested in the authority
figure. Significant difference between 8- and 11-year performance
were predominantly accounted for by qualitative differences in children's
reasoning about the type of authority on which the authority situation
was based. Performance on the three Structural Tasks increased significantly at age 8 (p <001) and not at age 11. Moderate and significant, positive correlations were obtained between performance
on the Authority measure and performance on the Class Inclusion and Multiplicative Classification tasks at ages 8 and 11, but not age 5.
It was concluded that the 5-year-old’s inability to differentiate levels of authority was related to his incapacity to perform basic logical operations. The influence of experiential factors was evident
in response patterns and it was suggested that a cognitive-developmental
perspective would be enriched through a study of the meanings children
project on to the authority relations they experience.",,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/3998",,,,"en",,,,,"University of Canterbury.

problem of educational disadvantage. It represents not only an important
aspect of inequality of opportunity, but also a cause of social
injustice. This is no less true in Malaysia where increasingly,
attention has been directed to ways of ameliorating this problem.
This research study concentrates on the above problem. It attempts
to examine factors considered important in contributing to educational
advantage and disadvantage in Malaysia. It does this by testing the
relationship of certain variables to success or failure in the Lower
Certificate of Education (LCE), in particular, in the technologically
important subjects of Science and Mathematics. An attempt is also
made to explore the relationship of need-achievement factors to success
or failure in LCE, and hence in educational advantage/disadvantage.
Method and Procedure
The sample consisted of 1,374 third formers in English medium
secondary schools in Klang, Malaysia. Both boys and girls of the three
racial groups were included.
The survey instruments included teachers' ratings of the socioeconomic
status and need-achievement of pupils, a questionnaire, a
need-achievement test, a job-values inventory, and LCE results published
by the Ministry of Education Malaysia.
The chi-square test of significance was used in the testing of
some thirty hypotheses, using a severe level of significance to
minimize errors in rejecting or accepting the null hypotheses. Many
combinations of relationships between variables were also examined by
chi-square for exploratory purposes. Finally, the Automatic Interaction
Detection (AID) technique was used to identify predictor
variables which explained best the variance in criterion variables.
Summary of Major Findings
Results of analyses showed that many factors operate to produce
educational advantage/disadvantage in Malaysia, the chief being socioeconomic.
These factors also combined to produce an important
mediatory factor - need-achievement, which affects success or failure
in LCE. The most important component of need-achievement is, however,
the actual striving sub-factor. The ideological component is less
important.
Racial differences in these two components of need-achievement
are obvious. Malay pupils tend to show a higher acceptance of the
ideology of achievement than the Chinese or the Indians, but, as
measured by teachers ratings, they tend to strive less hard in practice
than the Chinese. Thus, different racial groups showed different
degrees of success in LCE. The Chinese tend to achieve better LCE
grades than the Malays or the Indians.
There are also many interactions between predictor variables to
produce a combined effect on criterion variables. This is best shown
by the ""trees"" of educational advantage/disadvantage developed through
the technique of AID analysis. The non-symmetrical shape of the tree
shows clearly' the interaction between the variables at each branch.
These results point to the conclusion that if one is from a home
of high socio-economic status, one is more likely to obtain educational
advantage than one who comes from a low setio-economic status home.",,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/4002",,,,"en",,,,,"University of Canterbury.

However, it is difficult to find a brief group parenting intervention that teaches function-based assessment and from this function-based intervention plans. It is even more difficult to find a programme that has been culturally adapted for a Māori population. The aim of this project was to collect evidence on the effectiveness of the culturally adapted Parent Empowerment Programme (PEP).

The present project used a non-concurrent single case design with a sample of three parent-child dyads and one Playcentre supervisor. Parents self-identified a home routine time where their child engaged in challenging behaviour. Two 2-hour PEP workshops were conducted in the home of one of the participants. Parents undertook a 36 question Knowledge Quiz pre- and post- workshop. From the workshops, the parents identified the function of their child’s challenging behaviour and then identified the strategies they would use to decrease this behaviour in the home setting. Video recordings were used to obtain baseline, intervention, and follow-up measures on the percentage of time children engaged in challenging behaviour, and the percentage of parental use of positive behaviour support strategies during the identified home routine time.

The results showed: 1) three of the four participants increased their knowledge of functional behaviour assessment and positive behaviour strategies, 2) parents correctly identified the function of their child’s behaviour then identified and implemented a positive behaviour support strategy, 3) children’s challenging behaviours decreased and parental use of positive behaviour strategies increased during intervention phase, this was maintained at follow-up, 4) social validity results were varied with three of the participants finding the PEP socially acceptable, and 5) all participants engaged with and completed the programme.

The findings provide support for the effectiveness of the culturally adapted Parent Empowerment Programme, and showed that three parents can successfully identify and implement a function-based intervention in their own home with success.",,,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/13697",,,"en","English",,,,"University of Canterbury",,,,,,,"http://library.canterbury.ac.nz/thesis/etheses_copyright.shtml","All Rights Reserved",,,,,,,,,,,,"The effects of the Parent Empowerment Programme (PEP) with parents of young Māori children",,,"Electronic Thesis or Dissertation",,"Health Sciences",,"University of Canterbury",,"Masters",,,"Master of Arts",,"2497033",,,"College of Education, Health and Human Development, University of Canterbury",,"landon.lane@gmail.com",,,,,,,,,"Dr. Gaye Tyler-Merrick"
"19421","10092/806",,,"Cavuilati, Vakaruru",,,,,,,,"2018",,,"Climate change has a significant effect on human health manifested by the increasing number
of cases of climate-sensitive diseases. Europe and North America have experienced increasing 
number of deaths from heat waves, while in the Pacific there have been frequent outbreaks of 
dengue, leptospirosis, diarrhoea and typhoid. Climate  change  manifestation  through  
extreme weather events have caused substantial loss of infrastructure and also the agricultural 
sector in Fiji which has increased the risk of malnutrition in the country.

This study aims to examine the relationship between climate variability and the prevalence of 
malnutrition in Fiji between January 2006 and December 2016. The study also examines the specific 
aspects of climate variability and malnutrition during the same period. The ecological study 
design was used as aggregated data on climate change were used in the study.  The study conducted 
complementary quantitative and qualitative analyses. The quantitative part of the study was based 
on time series analysis, the additive model and smoothed using the moving aver- age to determine 
the trend of climate, malnutrition and crop production. The qualitative aspect examined works of 
existing works of literature on the other factors associated with malnutrition to explain the 
malnutrition trend where there is no influence of climate variables.

The study found evidence of seasonality in the climate variables, but there was no statistically 
significant fluctuations in the trends of minimum and maximum temperatures and humidity. 
However, there were fluctuations shown in average total rainfall. High rainfall periods in 2012 
coincided with an active La Nina and episodes of floods. The general trend of total rainfall shows 
that Fiji is getting drier.

There was seasonality found in child malnutrition where there was an increase in cases during the 
wet and hot summer season (November-April) and decrease in cases in the cold, dry winter season  
(May-September). The trend showed the prevalence of the indicators of  malnutrition 
(underweight, growth faltering, severe malnutrition and anaemia) decreased in the first half of 
2011 increased from the middle of 2011 to its highest peak in the first quarter of 2012 and decreased from the third quarter of 2012 until 2013. The decrease in malnutrition trend 
in 2011 was possibly due to the active government policies introduced such as the food voucher 
program, provision of the employment centre, the introduction of regulating infant food and 
promotion of breastfeeding. On the other hand, when the government introduced other 
policies such as the increase in value-added tax, it increased basic food prices, and  
it was difficult for needy families to get decent healthy meals. The extreme weather events 
(episodes of flooding) caused by La Nina and a tropical disturbance in the first quarter of 2012 
exacerbated the prevalence of malnutrition. There were shortages of crops, fruits and vegetables 
and food prices increased. The malnutrition trend improved in the third quarter of 2012 and going 
into 2013 due to the resilience of the Fijian government and people in adapting to climate change.  
The government work in partnership with all its relevant stakeholders to minimise further health 
effects, through food, medicine, water rations and the supply of seedling and land preparation to 
affected farmers. The increase in the budget for water, food voucher and the introduction of other 
social protection policies and health policies implemented in 2010 may have reduced malnutrition 
further.

The effects of climate change such as episodes of flooding exacerbate the prevalence of malnutrition in Fiji.  Climate change, through the increase in the intensity and the frequency of extreme 
weather events will be more severe in the future, but effective government policies and programs 
contribute to adaptation and resilience in minimising the effect. The findings of this study suggest that proactive  policies from the Government may contribute towards building  
resilience against adverse effects of climate change in Fiji.",,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/15687",,,,"en","English",,,,"University of Canterbury",,,,,,,"http://library.canterbury.ac.nz/thesis/etheses_copyright.shtml","All Rights Reserved",,,,,,,,,,,,"Climate change and human health: an ecological study on climate variability and malnutrition in Fiji",,,"Electronic Thesis or Dissertation",,,,"University of Canterbury",,"Masters",,,"Master of Health Sciences",,,,,"College of Education, Health and Human Development, University of Canterbury",,"vcavuilati@gmail.com",,,,,,,,,"Dr Arindam Basu"
"16716","10092/806",,,"Pfeifer, Gerald A. A.",,,,,,,,"2017",,,"This thesis proposes an extension to restorative discipline practices in order to provide better education for adult democratic citizenship. It argues that school discipline is subject to widespread misunderstanding, and that many classroom management systems fail to attend to a complete conception of its goals. Restorative discipline is a notable exception, and is currently being implemented under the policy of Positive Behaviour for Learning in New Zealand. Attention to the rational consideration of fairness, as well as the restoration of relationships that have been harmed, is argued to be educative about the justification of authority. Such education is a commonly neglected goal of good school discipline, as many classroom management systems seek to maintain order without helping pupils to understand why it is justified by any means other than the declaration of the person perceived to have power.

Learning about why certain restrictions on one’s behaviour are fair is educative about the justification of social institutions in a democracy. Students who better understand how the authority of state institutions is grounded in more than the will of those in power are better prepared for engagement with adult democratic life. The consideration of fair resolutions to conflicts when two parties have fundamental disagreements over facts or values can contribute to this, and this can be discussed in restorative conversations in addition to considering what harm has been done. This thesis proposes greater attention in restorative conversations to asking what might be fair in addition to how a relationship might be repaired.

This thesis draws not just on restorative theory, but also on Gutmann and Thompson’s deliberative model of democracy and conceptions of justice as fairness in the tradition of Rawls. It proposes social contract theory as a means of exploring fairness in the classroom, with particular attention to Gauthier’s contractarianism and Scanlon’s contractualism, and makes comparison and finds contrast with Kohlberg’s education for cognitive moral development.",,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/13711",,,,"en","English",,,,"University of Canterbury",,,,,,,"http://library.canterbury.ac.nz/thesis/etheses_copyright.shtml","All Rights Reserved",,,,,,,,,,,,"School discipline for democratic citizenship education : extending restorative practices.",,,"Electronic Thesis or Dissertation",,,"Education","University of Canterbury",,"Doctoral",,,"Doctor of Philosophy",,,,,"College of Education, Health and Human Development, University of Canterbury",,"gerald.pfeifer@wadham.oxon.net",,,,,,,,,"Professor Peter Roberts and Adjunct Associate Professor John Freeman-Moir"
"16729","10092/806",,,,"Rasheed, Mollah Mohammed Haroon Ar",,,,,,,"2017",,,"This study reports an interventive project in the ESL (English as a second language) programme of a rural junior secondary school in Bangladesh. The aim of the project was to introduce an interactive pedagogy and so make classes more relevant and enjoyable. This project explored a way to change from the existing teaching practice, which is transmissional and examination oriented (Podder, 2013; Mazumder, 2013).

As a result of global approaches to English language teaching the Government of Bangladesh has committed to encourage the use of interactive exercises in ESL teaching through various teacher training programmes. Studies, such as those by Abdullah and Shah, (2015) and Abedin (2012) show that there are many contextual challenges that hinder the initiatives, such as large classes, lack of opportunities to practice language, short class times, an extensive curriculum, an incoherent examination system and the use of traditional top down pedagogy. As a result, teachers often cite the various local and national challenges to justify continued use of traditional teaching methods in English sessions (Alam & Kabir, 2015; Ali & Walker, 2014; Ansarey, 2012).

This study began with the development of a teaching resource based on content from the Government supplied mandatory textbook but including a range of student-centred and group activities, including the use of role. As well as seeking to make classes more interactive, the resource suggested ways to implement a blended language strategy (Hamid, Jahan & Islam, 2014; Sultana, 2014), in order to reduce students’ fear of English, and consequent silence during classes, and to allow them to be creative and critical in making meaning through the target language.

The thesis reports a workshop in which the resource was trialled with teachers and then a series of classes in which the teachers applied the resource in classwork with students. The workshop and classes are reported as a series of narratives.

The methodological design is one of case study, with the case being the trialling of the interactive exercises in the project within the normal class of a rural junior secondary school. The approach is qualitative, seeking to capture aspects of the lived experience and the ways these experiences impacted on students’, teachers’ and my own learning. I drew on data from classroom observations, photographs of the lessons in progress, interviews with students and teachers and my own reflective field journal. In analysing the process and in presenting findings I selected four thematic elements: engagement, creativity, enjoyment and criticality. The chapters are organised accordingly.

Through this account of how one project navigated the challenges that challenges that exist in ESL teaching in rural schools, this thesis offers an example of how ESL sessions can become interactive in Bangladesh context. This study argues that although there is still much to do in improving education in Bangladesh, it is not always needed to look for models of effective practice from outside sources but rather that models can be developed within the Bangladesh context.

While actions in a single classroom cannot in themselves make a large impact on a country’s education as a whole, this case offers an example that change is possible and so may inspire future steps. This investigation, therefore, offers suggestions for educational policy and practice, indicating ways to break the student silence which often occurs in ESL sessions in rural Bangladesh.",,,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/13726",,,"en","English",,,,"University of Canterbury",,,,,,,"http://library.canterbury.ac.nz/thesis/etheses_copyright.shtml","All Rights Reserved",,,,,,,,,,,,"Breaking the silence: experimenting with creative approaches to ESL classrooms in a rural Bangladesh context",,,"Electronic Thesis or Dissertation",,"Education",,"University of Canterbury",,"Doctoral",,,"Doctor of Philosophy",,"2498187",,,"College of Education, Health and Human Development, University of Canterbury",,"sabuz32&gmail.com",,,,,,,,,"Professor Janinka Greenwood"
"16748","10092/806",,,"Jamieson, Patricia A",,,,,,,,"2017",,,"Objective: To understand the impact of Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder (FASD) on the individual, their family/whānau, community and society within the Aotearoa New Zealand (ANZ) context. .
Background: An alcohol consumption culture has developed over many years in ANZ. This has resulted in emotional and financial costs, not only to the individual, but their family/whānau, communities and to society as a whole. This cost can extend to the unborn child when a woman consumes alcohol while pregnant resulting in permanent damage to their Central Nervous System (CNS). This damage is irreversible and to date there is no successful pharmaceutical intervention.
Up until 40 years ago, FASD was not recognised, so those affected would either go misdiagnosed or undiagnosed. Interventions were not put in place to support the individual, family/whānau and other societal groups. Subsequently, research and recognition of FASD has developed, but much of this knowledge is not well utilised for the support of those with or caring for those with FASD.
Methods: To address the research objective a narrative literature review was undertaken. Bronfenbrenner’s Ecological Systems Theory provided a framework for synthesis of the literature. Five themes were extracted from the literature and were used to frame the discussion. These themes were: (1) a drinking culture which has developed over time; (2) risk factors for the unborn child; (3) the importance of early diagnosis and intervention for a child with FASD; (4) A multidisciplinary approach to assessment and diagnosis across the life span for those with FASD; and finally (5) ANZ policy implications.
Discussion: The child who has FASD symptoms being referred for an assessment and diagnosis, along with an individualised intervention plan being implemented, will provide the best opportunity for the child to flourish. Undiagnosed or wrongly diagnosed young people with FASD symptoms are likely to develop secondary conditions. This will have long term consequences for not only the individual, but their family/whānau, community and ANZ society. This literature review has critiqued the FASD action plan released by the Ministry of
Health (MoH) in 2016 using international literature resulting in recommendations for future research in the ANZ context.

Summary of Conclusions and Recommendations:
The drinking culture of ANZ has developed since colonisation. Alcohol consumption has cost not only the individual and their families, but communities and ANZ society as a whole although the MoH (2016) has released the FASD Action Plan 2016-2019 with a budget attached to implement the plan, gaps have been identified. These gaps include: the financing of screening, referral, assessment, and diagnosis; along with developing and implementing intervention strategies with all who are affected by FASD. These individualised interventions would help avoid people affected by FASD developing secondary conditions which cost society in the long term. Within the context of ANZ and Treaty obligations, a significant gap identified is the need to consult with Māori in developing policy and programmes that are culturally appropriate for Māori.",,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/14687",,,,"en","English",,,,"University of Canterbury",,,,,,,"http://library.canterbury.ac.nz/thesis/etheses_copyright.shtml","All Rights Reserved",,,,,,,,,,,,"The challenge of supporting children with Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder in Aotearoa New Zealand: A narrative literature review”",,,"Electronic Thesis or Dissertation",,,,"University of Canterbury",,"Masters",,,"Master of Health Sciences",,,,,"College of Education, Health and Human Development, University of Canterbury",,"patricia.jamieson@pg.canterbury.ac.nz",,,,,,,,,"Dr Thomas Harding,"

Method: qualitative descriptive approach was selected. Eight pharmacists practising in different settings, including inpatient hospice services and community pharmacy services providing hospice palliative care support, consented to participate in the study. Semi-structured face to face interviews were conducted with each participant. Thematic analysis was applied to illustrate common themes among participants to obtain manifest and latent contents, demonstrating differences in cultural and professional contexts within the settings. 

Results: Seven themes are extracted from the interviews. They are classified as “Expectations”, “A typical day at work”, “Relationship”, “Challenges”, “Things to improve”, “The fit of background” and “The important things”. Each theme demonstrates real-life experience from each participant. Pharmacists started their career in palliative care with different expectations, along with different extents of service provision. They confront similar barriers that affect their passion and dedication to the service. Much effort has been made by pharmacists in New Zealand to enhance and develop the clinical pharmacy service in hospice palliative care. However, challenging hurdles, such as relationships within a clinical team and funding issues, are limiting their role within the multidisciplinary team. 

Conclusion: Successes and failures are noted in the establishment and development of clinical pharmacy practice in palliative care service in New Zealand. With a similar developmental context, Vietnamese pharmacists can learn from the experience of New Zealand’s pharmacists.

"16800","10092/806",,,,"Adams, Jade",,,,,,,"2017",,,"Five years on from the 2010-2011 Canterbury earthquakes, research has shown an
increase in hyperarousal symptoms in school children. While Cognitive Behaviour Therapy is
currently the gold standard for treating Post-Traumatic Stress, there are insufficient clinicians
to treat the high numbers of children in post-disaster communities. Alternative non-verbal
interventions in school based settings that target the physiological basis of hyperarousal may
be more effective for long term stress reduction in some young children. Neuroscience
research suggests that drawing activates brain areas connected with the autonomic nervous
system, resulting in relaxation and self-regulation. The aim of the current study was to
determine whether a 20-minute drawing lesson during the afternoon of the school day would
reduce stress in children with hyperarousal symptoms.

The study had a single subject ABA design. Four children participated, two of the
children exhibited hyperarousal symptoms, and the other two did not, as determined by
teacher and parent responses on the Behaviour Problem Index (BPI). The children’s selfreported
stress (measured by the Subjective Unit of Distress (SUD) thermometer) and
physiological stress (measured by finger temperature) were recorded at the start and end of
each session during baseline, drawing lessons, and return to baseline phases.

The results of the study showed a general reduction in physiological stress during the
drawing lessons for the children with hyperarousal symptoms. However, the results indicated
some discrepancies between the children’s physiological stress and perception of stress,
which may suggest that the self-report measure was inappropriate for the children in this
study. Overall, the study suggests that drawing lessons show promise as a school-based
intervention for reducing stress in children with hyperarousal. More research is required to
address the limitations of the present study, and before the study can be applied to the whole
classroom as a positive strategy for managing stress at school.",,,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/13776",,,"en","English",,,,"University of Canterbury",,,,,,,"http://library.canterbury.ac.nz/thesis/etheses_copyright.shtml","All Rights Reserved",,,,,,,,,,,,"The effect of drawing lessons on hyperarousal in children who experienced the Canterbury Earthquakes.",,,"Electronic Thesis or Dissertation",,,"Health Sciences","University of Canterbury",,"Masters",,,"Master of Science",,"2498642",,,"College of Education, Health and Human Development, University of Canterbury",,"jad160@uclive.ac.nz",,,,,,,,,"Associate Professor Kathleen Liberty"

the miracle question sequence, a tool of Solution-Focused Brief Therapy (SFBT). The
original miracle question, developed by Steve de Shazer, Insoo Kim Berg and their
colleagues, was intended to help a client shift from being ‘stuck’ to feeling enabled to
move forward (de Jong and Berg, 2013).

The aim of this study was to capture the development of the miracle question
sequence of Solution-Focused Brief Therapy with young people in Aotearoa/New
Zealand. Five young people volunteered to participate in my reflective research, which
involved a counselling session, in which I introduced an adapted miracle question and
asked them to complete a Session Rating Scale (Duncan, Miller, Sparks, Johnson, 2003).
I also asked them to comment on the adapted miracle question. These counselling
sessions were videoed and analysed with a particular focus on participants’ shaping and
articulation of the miracle question sequence. Through a qualitative interpretive analysis,
I was able to retrieve rich data that exemplified the co-construction in which the
participants and myself engaged. Clients also said that they enjoyed using the adapted
miracle question, felt heard and liked thinking about their future and preferred future in
a novel way.

Through further reflection on the analysis I was able to describe some key
elements of this co-construction that have informed my practice with the miracle
question. Further, I discuss this with respect to the vulnerabilities of a novice counsellor
when she/he feels ‘stuck’.

The gap in achievement levels within the area of writing between boys and girls has been well documented. Research and recommendations have been made to narrow this gap and to understand, address and improve the complex issue of boys and their writing. However, recent evidence suggests this remains an issue. Therefore, the voices of twelve male writers between the ages of nine and eleven were sought to investigate the research question; “What are the thoughts, perceptions and experiences of twelve Year 5 and 6 boys as writers?”

A variety of qualitative methods were used in this research project, including individual interviews, group discussions, participant observations and writing sessions. These were conducted at a New Zealand primary school over a five-week period. This study found that the boys placed considerable emphasis on the freedom, choice and ownership of the writing topics and content. The writing of stories and the social world of writing were also valued by these male writers. This study also identified differences between official writing, in the form of the school based curriculum writing, and the unofficial writing world of boys’ story writing. Furthermore, gender stereotypes and constructs were evident in boys’ perceptions of writing. Finally, the boys placed emphasis on the role of spelling and punctuation and the quantity of writing output.",,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/13795",,,,"en","English",,,,"University of Canterbury",,,,,,,"http://library.canterbury.ac.nz/thesis/etheses_copyright.shtml","All Rights Reserved",,,,,,,,,,,,"The thoughts, perceptions and experiences of twelve year 5 and 6 male writers at a New Zealand primary school.",,,"Electronic Thesis or Dissertation",,,"Education","University of Canterbury",,"Masters",,,"Master of Education",,"2503842",,,"College of Education, Health and Human Development, University of Canterbury",,"jennyw@ohopebeach.school.nz",,,,,,,,,"Jo Fletcher"

Secondary schools in Bangladesh are gradually initiating inclusive teaching and learning approaches to respond to the significant shifts in policy. This research examines the relationships between global pressures, national policies for the inclusion of children with disabilities and the aspirations, practices and needs in secondary schools in Bangladesh. In particular, it examines political rhetoric concerning valuing diversity within Bangladesh and juxtaposes this rhetoric with case studies of the practice of five selected schools. There is very little comprehensive research in this field in Bangladesh, so this project encompasses an exploration and review of policy and of policy context as well as an exploration of the grounded realities of education practices. It addresses the main research question: How do Bangladesh’s current policies for students with disabilities in secondary schools align with practice, resources and perceived needs?

The study utilised a qualitative case study methodology. The overarching case is that of inclusive education in Bangladesh. Within this, there are a number of embedded cases examining the practices of particular schools and the perspectives of policymakers. The study was conducted in two stages. The first stage was designed to get information on policy from documents and interviews with professionals including academics, teacher educators, policy administrators, policymakers, and education policy experts. The purpose of this phase was to investigate the policy options for educating children with disabilities in mainstream/inclusive setting and to understand the influences of global policies on Bangladesh policies and legislation. The second phase involved case studies of five selected secondary schools to investigate how such policies are translated into practices.

The study identified a gap between policies and practices that arose from the dominant influence of international drivers as well as the lack of strategic implementation processes. The findings from the study lead to the conclusion that schools were claiming to be implementing inclusive education despite their teachers having not received training in inclusive educational practices or having sufficient resources. As a consequence staff were often unaware of how to meet the needs of students with disabilities and of how to integrate them into class. It further identified the range of challenges that still exist.

The findings are significant for the Bangladesh context as the country strives to achieve the goal of inclusive education, and as a contribution to the wider debates of inclusion and inclusive education practices. Their implications are discussed in relation to further policy formation and to the development of strategies and resources for improving teaching learning practices in inclusive classrooms. The thesis concludes that the road to inclusion for Bangladesh secondary schools may well have begun but it requires further reformation of not only schools but also national strategies of policy development.",,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/14543",,,,"en","English",,,,"University of Canterbury",,,,,,,"http://library.canterbury.ac.nz/thesis/etheses_copyright.shtml","All Rights Reserved",,,,,,,,,,,,"Inclusive education aspirations: exploration of policy and practice in Bangladesh secondary schools",,,"Electronic Thesis or Dissertation",,,"Education","University of Canterbury",,"Doctoral",,,"Doctor of Philosophy",,,"2533499",,"College of Education, Health and Human Development, University of Canterbury",,"mahbub.rahaman@pg.canterbury.ac.nz, mahbub@du.ac.bd",,,,,,,,,"Professor Janinka Greenwood"

"17955","10092/806",,,"Chen, Cheng-Yang",,,,,,,,"2017",,,"The pulmonary rehabilitation programme is an evidence-based intervention to treat and manage people living with long-term breathing conditions, mainly chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Pulmonary rehabilitation is a structured eight-week long programme, which requires participants to attend the programme twice a week, for two hours each session. The two-hour session is broken down to one hour of exercise and one hour of education. The literature suggests that the pulmonary rehabilitation is useful in improving self-management skills, improving fitness levels, and reducing social isolation to the people living with chronic respiratory illnesses. Despite the strong evidence behind pulmonary rehabilitation, the programme is still not well utilised by health professionals and people living with chronic respiratory illnesses. There are many reasons for not participating in a pulmonary rehabilitation programme, such as not understanding the content of pulmonary rehabilitation, transportation difficulties, or work commitments. This study helped the pulmonary rehabilitation governance group to explore a different delivery model and evaluate the effect of this alternative pulmonary rehabilitation delivery model: the home-based pulmonary rehabilitation.

Participants (n= 21, 11 males: 10 females, mean age of 68.76 years, 71% of the participants identified themselves as New Zealand European and 14% identified as Māori) were recruited from the existing pool of withdraw referrals, that is people who had been referred to the programme but never attended or completed a programme. These participants had been offered pulmonary rehabilitation in the past but either declined or had been unable to participate in a programme. All the participants received a home visit from the physiotherapist for assessments, education, and to set up the DVD exercise regime. The home-based programme lasted for eight weeks and each participant received a weekly telephone call from a health professional to check on the participant’s exercise progress. The Chronic Respiratory Questionnaire (CRQ), COPD Assessment Tool Score (CATS) and EQ-5D questionnaires were used to evaluate the quality of life and self-management before and after the home-based programme. The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) was used to assess participants’ psychological wellbeing. Finally, one-minute sit-to-stand tests were carried out before and after the programme to identify any change in the participant’s exercise tolerance. The collected data were analysed and compared to the control, centre-based pulmonary rehabilitation data, using a 2-tail t-test to determine statistical significant difference.

The home-based pulmonary rehabilitation programme performed no worse than the gold standard centre-based pulmonary rehabilitation in the majority of the outcome measures used. The home-based pulmonary rehabilitation was better at reaching out to younger, male, and Māori participants when compared to the control, the centre-based pulmonary rehabilitation. The majority of the primary and secondary outcome measures showed that the home-based pulmonary rehabilitation performed as well as the control, the centre-based pulmonary rehabilitation programme, in making significant improvements. But in fatigue management, exercise tolerance, and EQ-5D, the control, centre based group was able to achieve superior outcomes when compared to the home-based pulmonary rehabilitation.

This study has successfully demonstrated that the home-based pulmonary rehabilitation is an effective alternative to the gold standard centre-based pulmonary rehabilitation when managing people living with COPD. Despite the fact that the home based group participants were recruited from a less favourable pool of participants, the withdrawals, the home-based pulmonary rehabilitation was an enabler to positive and significant improvement to the participants in all outcome measures. The main weaknesses of the home-based pulmonary rehabilitation lies with the reduced clinician supervision of the participant’s exercise regime and the lack of social interaction in this delivery model. The author believes, however, that with continuous service review, research and development, these weaknesses can eventually be effectively managed and minimised.",,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/14544",,,,"en","English",,,,"University of Canterbury",,,,,,,"http://library.canterbury.ac.nz/thesis/etheses_copyright.shtml","All Rights Reserved",,,,,,,,,,,,"To examine the effects of DVD exercises on exercise tolerance in participants of the Canterbury home-based pulmonary rehabilitation programme",,,"Electronic Thesis or Dissertation",,,,"University of Canterbury",,"Masters",,,"Master of Health Sciences",,,,,"College of Education, Health and Human Development, University of Canterbury",,"daveynztw@gmail.com",,,,,,,,,"Professor Ray Kirk"

After describing the creation of a network of primary schools and the means by which regular attendance was secured it describes the schools' role in fostering the conventional virtues and certain widely held social attitudes through the ""hidden curriculum"", through school discipline, and through teachers' example. The social and moral content of schoolwork is then analysed with particular attention to what was said about New Zealand itself and about Maoris and racial differences. A detailed examination is made of a number of attempts to enlist the schools in particular social and moral causes: religious education, temperance, the inculcation of patriotism, sex education, military training, ""correct"" speech, and secular moral instruction. The closing chapters consider the differential impact of schooling and credentialling on children from different social classes and on boys and girls. This study draws on a wide variety of sources and makes extensive use of a large collection of school texts of the period~ The values schools transmitted reflected a middle class consensus, not seriously challenged by workers. The content of schooling was chiefly contested by middle class groups seeking to purify and improve the existing social order. Middle class groups were ambivalent towards the emergence of a distinctive national identity, but the schools fostered, often as unintended consequences, certain aspects of national identity.",,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/819",,,,,,"en",,,"University of Canterbury.

The material presented in this report resulted from quantitative and qualitative study over an eighteen month period commencing in February, 1989. Data collection techniques included interviews, classroom observations and questionnaire surveys which were used to compile base-line data on the numbers and backgrounds of pupils enrolled in the programmes, classroom practices, perceptions of parents and school staff and outcomes of the programmes. The research also included a number of interviews with affiliated personnel such as Kohanga Reo parents and staff, local kaumatua, and officials from the Ministry and Department of Education.

A review of studies which had examined the maintenance of teaching skills found that some training programmes which used skill practice and feedback on performance were successful in achieving maintenance. The present study was designed to test the effect of practice and feedback in diverse settings on the acquisition and maintenance of teaching skills. The following skills were selected for training: 1. Increasing the use of approval and decreasing the use of disapproval. 2. Increasing the use of feedback and decreasing the use of criticism. 3. Using wait-time: (a) after asking a question and before calling on a student to answer, (teacher wait-time) and (b) after a student response has finished (pupil wait-time). Repeated measures were made of nineteen student teachers teaching during a six week student teaching practice prior to the training course and again immediately following it. Ten of them, who also secured teaching positions, were observed when teaching in their own classrooms. During the training course, the subjects practised some skills until the training targets had been achieved five times in each of two settings (the 2 X 5 treatment). They practised the remaining skills until the training targets had been achieved two times in each of two classroom settings (the 2 X 2 treatment). The subjects observed one another practise and the results of these observations were used to provide them with performance feedback. There was a general training effect although there was no treatment effect for the amount of practice. More maintenance was found when the subjects became employed as classroom teachers than was observed immediately after training. More skills were maintained when there was a match between the class level being taught and the class level practised with during training. Feedback was maintained by most subjects while teacher wait-time and low rates of criticism were maintained by the fewest subjects. It was hypothesized that the subjects had previously been subjected to thousands of hours of observational learning of teacher behaviour and that a brief training course may not have had sufficient impact to counter such prior learning. It was also hypothesized that there were unidentified stimuli, context variables and sources of reinforcement controlling the performance of particular skills by individual subjects. It was concluded that future research in this field should seek to identify these sources of stimulus control.",,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/813",,,,,,"en",,,"University of Canterbury.

Part one deals with precursors to outdoor education, from the late nineteenth century to 1938, and in part two school camping experiments and the expansion of outdoor education are examined. Outdoor education was stimulated by subject specialists working for education boards and the Department of Education, and the end of the period studied coincides with the disestablishment of these administrative bodies in 1989. Where possible, comparison with overseas developments is made. Outdoor education was adopted and expanded in New Zealand because political, economic and ideological circumstances favoured it. Progressive-liberal influences on education fostered acceptance of physical, recreational and practical activities and emphasis on the interests and needs of individual pupils. Social and economic policies of the later 1930s to the 1960s established a climate in which innovations that broadened the school curriculum were acceptable. From the late 1960s the struggle to resource outdoor education was exacerbated by its rapid rate of growth. The government funding attained was never sufficient and community support remained vital. Safety concerns from the 1960s to the end of the period precipitated efforts to establish teacher training and by the 1980s there was a growing professionalism among outdoor educators. Links between outdoor education and the school curriculum at both primary and secondary levels were maintained by changes in terminology but its central concerns with social and moral education, environmental studies, physical activity and communal living in natural environments remained. Unlike most other curriculum innovations of its time, outdoor education was initially viewed as a teaching method and it did not attain formal subject status until the 1980s.",,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/810",,,,,,"en",,,"University of Canterbury.

"1159","10092/806",,,,,"Lauder, Hugh",,,,,,"1982",,,"This thesis is concerned with the nature and application of educational theory. In particular, it will examine the contribution social theories can make in guiding educational practices which are intended to achieve specific educational aims. Recent social theories relevant to education have focused, primarily, on the relationship between school and society under capitalism. Such theories have been developed in order to illuminate two central questions, ""to what extent are schools independent of the class structures and ideologies of capitalist society?"" and relatedly, ""to what degree, under capitalism, can schools develop the critical social awareness necessary for personal autonomy?"". In this thesis it is argued that a number of recent theories fail to help in providing answers to these questions because they do not offer convincing explanations of the school-society relationship. The reason for this is that they are guided by inadequate, epistemological methodological and metaphysical assumptions. In particular, they have been guided either by a naturalist view of social theory predicated on a Logical Positivist view of natural science or by an anti-naturalist view. This latter view typically asserts that explanations for social action must necessarily make reference to concepts such as rules, meanings, goals and purposes. And it is noted that these concepts can have no place within a Logical Positivist account of science. However, I argue that neither the guiding assumptions of naturalists or anti-naturalists, who have accepted a Logical Positivist view of natural science, can enable the construction of theories which capture significant dimensions of schooling under capitalism. In this thesis a number of Liberal and Radical theories of the school-society relationship, which have been influenced either by the guiding assumptions of Logical Positivism or by its anti-naturalist contrasts are critically examined. It is argued that while Radical theories such as those of Young, Freire and Bowles and Gintis have made a contribution to an understanding of the school-society relationship, their explanations of this relationship are inadequate. Consequently, they fail to guide educational practice by not showing how a pedagogy aimed at developing the critical social awareness necessary for personal autonomy is possible. On the basis of the criticisms of these Radical theories an alternative theory of the school-society relationship is advanced, one which is guided by the tenets of a Realist theory of natural science suitably qualified to apply to social theory. Through the development of this Realist social theory it is possible to explain how relevant aspects of educational practice can be guided, by the alternative social theory developed, in order to fulfil the aim of personal autonomy.",,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/812",,,,,,"en",,,"University of Canterbury.

Super's writings provided the basis for the identification and classification of indices of vocational maturity in the fifth form. The thesis postulated that the efficiency of these indices in predicting vocational adjustment, in the first year out of school, provided a crucial test of Super's developmental theory. Forward regression, a variation of stepwise regression, was used to identify efficient predictors. In general, it was not possible to predict adjustment in the first year of a career from the proposed indices of vocational maturity. It was possible to predict, with a fair degree of accuracy, the level of occupational attainment from the boys' educational attainment and aspirations. The results raise some doubts about the tenability of a developmental theory, if the goal is vocational adjustment.

"1377","10092/806",,,,,"Stoop, Graham Charles",,,,,,"1998",,,"This is a study of the New Zealand English curriculums, 1969-1996. The study is  organised around three phases of reform: the initial changes made to the teaching of  English in the first three years of secondary school; the later reform of the senior-school  English syllabus; the more recent development of an integrated national curriculum  statement for the teaching of English. These reforms are charted in a narrative fashion,  although the thesis does not purport to be a full history of English teaching in the period  under review. Instead, the various developments and changes to English teaching in  New Zealand secondary schools, during a thirty year period, are contextualised under  the interpretative paradigm: the management of knowledge.  It is argued herein that knowledge, and, in this case, the subject English, has been  managed - consciously and unconsciously - in the interests of dominant socio-cultural  and socio-economic groups. I aver that even alleged progressive developments in the  pedagogy of classroom life have been routinised in the curriculum statements.  Consequently, there has been an official sanctioning of established or conservative  perspectives on the way English language and literature should be taught, thus often  denying the emancipatory themes of respect for the human subject and human agency.  My contention is advanced and supported through a careful examination of the  curriculum text discourses, and, in several instances, through an examination of the  transmission process from the draft statement to the published statement. I am therefore  able to argue that the English curriculums must be understood as part of wider social  and political processes: the curriculums are produced, managed and reproduced. The   influences of the social environment and, in particular, the ideological struggle between  State and society, are to be found in the English teaching discourse. This notion is  captured in the subtitle of the study: text and context.  The thesis concludes with a brief, personal reflection on how an English curriculum might  be theorised so that it does not impose on students a definition of reality that declares  the values and symbols of the social elites. I assert that an understanding of discourse,  or the discourses of knowledge, can provide a way forward for the theorising of the  subject English.",,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/1045",,,,"en",,,,,"University of Canterbury.

"1381","10092/806",,,,,"Lovett, Susan",,,,,,"2002",,,"Today's teachers work in exhausting times. Curriculum and assessment change has been unrelenting and even the most conscientious teachers often feel overwhelmed. At national and local levels, professional development programmes have assisted teachers to address these changes and a number of approaches have been adopted. However, while teachers have engaged in professional development programmes, the actual benefits to classroom teaching and learning have been less certain. The quantity and frantic pace of these changes have worked against the achievement of quality outcomes. This thesis makes an important contribution to existing knowledge about professional development practice because it investigates teachers' experiences of educational change and school improvement processes to show what is both helping and hindering teachers as learners. The findings suggest that currently many schools are not effective learning organisations. This research uses the example of the National Education Monitoring Project (NEMP) reports to explore teacher learning processes in action. It is argued that the impact of the NEMP reports and their assessment information is being compromised because classroom teachers are already fully committed to curriculum document developments mandated by the Ministry of Education. In fact all professional development projects are faced with the same dilemma that schools are working with multiple projects at the same time. While this continues to happen the potential benefits of the NEMP reports as assessment exemplars for effective assessment practice remain unrealised because teachers' time is drawn to so many other competing priorities. It is this reality which now makes answers to key questions about teacher learning especially important. These questions concern who makes the decisions about what it is that teachers should be learning and how this learning might be presented to them. It is a matter of concern that teachers are cast as 'victims of change' and decisions about their learning largely determined by others. Rather than helping schools to help themselves and become 'agents' of change, this practice increases teachers' dependence on others for learning. A three stage approach to data collection is used in order to suggest improvements to current practice in professional development for teachers. This begins with questionnaire surveys to establish baseline data on the impact of the NEMP reports on classroom teachers in the Canterbury region. From this information an intervention is introduced to eight teachers who share a quality learning circle experience in order to learn more about the NEMP reports. Then observations and interviews of teachers in case study schools show teacher learning in action and reveal the strengths and weaknesses of current professional development experiences within schools. It is argued that the future effectiveness of schools will depend upon their capacity to determine their own learning needs and then find ways of addressing them. Schools will therefore need to acquire a more extensive repertoire of data gathering and analysis skills if they are to know how they can make significant improvements and not just duplicate what others find suitable for other settings. It is argued that improvements to teacher learning and development must address the focus of how teachers learn and will require a major review of how schools are structured and organised for teacher learning. Different arrangements will be required to allow 'learner centred' practice and the emergence of teacher learning communities from within schools. Schools will stand a better chance of being learning organisations when steps are taken to remedy the current structural arrangements which at the moment work against quality learning for teachers.",,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/1049",,,,"en",,,,,"University of Canterbury.

But have you ever considered what it must be like to belong to a minority  culture? I certainly didn't, even though the primary school I work in is  multicultural.

They felt proud of their Samoan identify and equated their abilities in Samoan  as crucial to that.

Understandings of material, social and linguistic worlds do not, in themselves, cater for teachers' pragmatic needs to consider (a) the social consequences of educational practices, both their own and those of the institutions within which they work, and (b) the complexity of teaching in a postmodern world. I draw on ideas from pragmatism, post-structuralism, critical pedagogy, complexity theory, reflective practice, and personal experience in order to invite the emergence (or social construction) of new phenomena: these I hope, may enable teachers and other educationalists to take a vibrant part in ongoing debates and actions concerning educational policy and practice. I argue that the assumption that educational theory can be applied in practice is flawed and needs to be replaced by theory which recognises the dynamic nature of theory-in-practice: all theory is data within practice.  This is a late-career thesis written by a practitioner with an unusually broad experience of the New Zealand educational system. I argue that the purpose of theory is to guide practice, that practice must drive theory, and that theory and practice need to join together to focus on the consequences of planned actions. This is neo-pragmatism, but, as stated thus far, it is not enough for my purposes because it does not include a commitment to social justice. Praxis is a term which ties emancipatory political goals to theory-and-practice. I invite the construction of the understandings of praxitioner activities where collective praxis and individual praxis might co-emerge in the interests of social justice.

This investigation explores a group approach to early childhood teacher registration, where five registering teachers engaged in written reflections and discussion with their registration tutor, who was also the researcher. The teachers used practitioner inquiry as they explored their own practice and the practice of the team. The researcher used practitioner research to build on the teacher's inquiries. Individual written reflections and group discussions began to highlight differences in the ways teacher's interpreted practice.  As part of its communication processes the group regularly compared and categorised individual reflections. These general themes were made public and shared with the group, using a process that this research refers to as the  common anonymous voice'.  The key findings from this investigation concern the role practitioner action research played in the communication of the group. Discussion and written reflections were shown to provide the group with alternative forms of communication. As tensions and challenges regarding group practice emerged in the discussions, teachers began to rely more on the reflective writing process to articulate their own professional philosophies. Shifts in group dynamics were highlighted as the group moved from the need to agree, through to an acceptance of diversity. Individual teaching beliefs and practices were seen as contributing to the collective process of teaching and learning.  The reflexive action research framework developed in this study aligns itself with sociocultural notions of learning and development.

This study explores senior ESOL (English for Speakers of Other Languages) students' experiences of and attitudes towards formative assessment in the mainstream classroom.  The purpose of this study was to investigate how formative assessment might be used effectively to enhance ESOL students' learning from the perspective of senior ESOL students.      Data were collected using mixed methods including questionnaires and follow-up interviews with a range of participants from different ethnic backgrounds. One hundred ESOL students participated in the questionnaire and 22 were subsequently interviewed.  The questionnaire provided data on the majority ESOL students' experiences and attitudes.  Then the interviews allowed participants to describe their experiences and attitudes in more detail.  The qualitative methodology used also provided the opportunity for the participants to explain any possible reasons for their attitudes.    This study revealed that all the participants had some experiences in some of the formative assessment activities used in classroom.  The participants' perspectives also indicated that ESOL students' high expectations for their academic achievement relied on teachers' understanding of their needs as well as effective classroom practice.     Feedback was the most favoured formative assessment method by the ESOL students because the students could find out what they had done correctly and where they had gone wrong. Questioning was not liked by the participants, partly because of the language barrier limiting their understanding of the questions, partly because of the way teachers asked the questions (i.e. no wait-time), and partly because of cultural sensitivity (i.e. not wanting to draw attention to oneself). However, the value of questioning as a formative assessment method was recognised by a number of the participants. Self-assessment was liked and found to be useful by some participants. Peer assessment was not liked because of the students' mistrust of their peers' ability to mark their work correctly. Sharing learning objectives and assessment criteria was regarded as an important way to enhance learning as long as teachers provided clear explanations.    The study raises questions about the effectiveness of existing formative assessment activities used in classroom and suggests some specific strategies that may help ESOL students learn more effectively. This study clearly indicates that not all formative assessments are equally effective to students of different backgrounds. The choice of formative assessment methods and the way they are administered in class are both important in determining their success for the participants. ESOL students have their own characteristics and needs (e.g. language limitations) and these should to be taken into consideration when choosing and implementing formative assessment methods.  The study is of interest in particular to those who teach ESOL students in mainstream classrooms but also has strong links to the field of cross cultural communication, and to the study of effective teaching and learning.",,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/1058",,,,"en",,,,,"University of Canterbury.

A group of eleven  Year 4 children (8 years old) participated in a series of 13 lessons where they became coresearchers  in the exploration of their learning. A contextually based thematic approach was  provided through 'Crocodilian Studies'. The mixed-method approach to this study included  formal assessment, participant observation, individual interviews, the children's written ideas, and  individual case studies.  The most significant finding of this study was the powerful influence of peer learning. The  children enriched and directed each other's learning as they shared ideas and reflected on their  own mathematical learning as they observed and critiqued the thinking of peers. As the children  were involved in thinking about how they learn they were able to identify gaps and construct their  own learning pathways. A significant finding was that children can develop their multiplicative  strategies while they commit their multiplication facts to memory, in a relatively short time  provided that the learning process facilitates strategy development and understanding. By  exposing the children to multiplication facts in sequenced clusters provided them with a  manageable number of facts to be learnt at one time. Another finding related to how children  develop calculation strategies through lesson activities rather than being explicitly taught them.  The children considered practice important for memorisation.

The significance of the social aspects of learning to read is also highlighted. It was  revealed that what children actually learned and the types of reading responses they  made during class activities were only rarely visible or audible to their teacher. The  children's management of their learning environment meant that many reading  opportunities were used in different ways from those intended by the teacher, and that  learning was often only indirectly related to teaching. The implication for teachers is the  need to consider how little of children's learning experiences are audible or visible to  them, so that they can develop strategies to provide appropriate reading instruction and  adequate reading experiences.

"1394","10092/806",,,,,"Harris, Fleur Estelle Jeanne",,,,,,"2007",,,"Since early European settlement of Aotearoa New Zealand Māori children have been constructed as deficient learners in the education system, and this construction continues to undermine their learning at school today (Butchers, 1930; Macfarlane, 2005; Ministry of Education, 1998, 2005).  Educational assessment practices have largely contributed to this discourse, because they reflect western ideologies regarding the reasons for testing, who does the testing, what counts as important to test, how results are interpreted and so on (Bishop & Glynn, 1999). Further, the tests used have been developed with monolingual and monocultural European children.  Reading acquisition and language development have been implicated as major learning deficits for Māori children (Crooks & Flockton, 2005; Ministry of Education, 2006; Wagemaker, 1992).  And a body of research signals that the reading related language skills for phonological awareness and narrative ability are linked to reading acquisition for English (Adams, 1990; Botting, 2002; Rollins, McCabe & Bliss, 2000).  My research is an enquiry into how Māori children respond to reading related language assessments for narratives and phonological awareness, taking into account their lived experiences and cultural practices. My aim is to create possibilities for alternative discourses to the deficit discourse. With support from a local Kaumātua and school whānau I worked as a participant-observer in two classrooms in two schools for one year, following 17 Māori children. Critical theory, socio cultural theory and Kaupapa Māori theory informed my position. The techniques I used to approach my research practice and analyse my data reflect the influence of these frames as I understand and interpret them.  Throughout the year of field work, I undertook a range of activities, including conversations with parents, children and school personnel, observations of class 'lessons' and the teaching strategies used by the teacher, visits to the children's homes, collection of school records, and administration of assessments related to reading, narrative tasks, and phonological awareness according to a standardized English test, the Preschool and Primary Inventory of Phonological Awareness (PIPA) (Dodd, Crosbie, MacIntosh, Teitzel & Ozanne, 2000) and a specifically designed set of Māori language tasks. I used video and audio recording for some activities, and wrote my observation notes while observing or immediately following an event or session.  My findings showed that the home and school contexts for the children were largely bicultural and bilingual.  The children were living their lives in ways vastly different to monolingual and moncultural Pākehā (European) children.  Those who had been at school for approximately five years were reading at or above their age, in line with traditional reading norms, despite showing relatively poor phonological awareness skills determined by the 'standard' test procedures.  The 'standard' testing process for both phonological awareness and narrative ability presented most of the children as language deficient and in need of intervention, or at least in need of ongoing monitoring.  However, my analyses driven from the theoretical frames mentioned above presented the children with language strengths and difference. These children were clearly able, achieving learners.  My study highlighted the fact that the bilingual and bicultural knowledge and skills of Māori children are not valued in the predominantly monolingual and mono-cultural education system, and this has serious implications for their learning and for perpetuating the cycle of deficiency construction because the children are seen not to meet the requirements of the system and its assessment protocols. Further, regardless of phonological awareness and narrative 'ability', by the time Māori children have been at school for a period of time, approximately five years, they are able to read English and understand the written text.  This finding questions the relevance of the salience generally attributed to phonological awareness as a crucial building block for bilingual children who are proficient in or exposed to a non-alphabetic language, such as te reo Māori.  I argue that the assessments used in schools are inappropriate for bilingual and bicultural Māori children.  When the children's language skills were analysed using alternative systems to the 'standard' methods prevalent in schools, they were able and achieving learners.  They were not learners 'at-risk' but learners 'at-promise', to use Tabachnick and Bloch's terms (1995).  This study provides empirical evidence that bilingual and bicultural Māori children's learning needs are not met by the current school system. Continued research in this area will strengthen the necessity for changes to be made in the education system, changes that are sensitive to, and value, linguistic and cultural difference in the classroom.  In the areas of pre-service teacher and speech-language therapist education, and ongoing professional development for educationalists, linguistic and cultural differences need to be presented afresh.  Educational assessment practices must change to recognise learning strengths of Māori children and to stop the perpetuation of deficiency constructions.  Schools have to be willing to understand more fully the home contexts of their students and to engage in teaching practices that are cognizant of their cultural and linguistic backgrounds. Without such fundamental changes in our view of the cultural and linguistic strengths of Māori children, very little real change can occur despite lofty words and plethora of strategies and policies.",,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/1062",,,,"en",,,,,"University of Canterbury.

Recent studies related to online discussions have provided different ways of understanding the effect of online discussions on teaching and learning.  This study investigates how personal learning is facilitated through various ways of engagement in an online discussion environment.   The rationale behind this effort has been the concern that online discussions may be being used only because of the availability and technological opportunities the method provides. Personal learning is generally viewed in the literature as an individual's cognitive and knowledge construction and endeavour to make meaning through involvement and interaction in a community and context.  There are, however, great variations in the way individuals engaged in their own learning within a community of learners. Motivation and strategies are also seen as factors that influence to individual level of engagement in online discussions.  The findings reveal different types of interactions and highlight different levels of individual participation and engagement in the online discussions. From the findings, the Types of Online Interaction Model is developed to show the different roles that individual might adopt in the online discussion environment. The adopted roles are the individual approaches and actions that contribute to personal learning during the online discussion. The roles are flexible and individuals are likely to move from one role to another when there are reasons to do so. This study also shows the importance of the interactions that enable learning within the community. Two case studies discussed in this thesis illustrate the individual strategies of a provocateur and an eventual participant, which show how different ways of engaging in an online discussion community of learners contribute to individual learning.",,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/1063",,,,"en",,,,,"University of Canterbury.

"1396","10092/806",,,,,"Rathgen, Elody",,,,,,"1996",,,"This thesis comprises an analysis of ways to approach developing feminist pedagogies. Its main premise is that given the ideological, political and problematic nature of teaching and learning within educational institutions, it is not possible to define and prescribe a certain set of teaching behaviours that would constitute 'successful feminist pedagogy' in all circumstances. Instead, the thesis explores the changing nature of feminist theories, particularly the shift from essentialist feminism to feminisms of difference. It also considers a range of other influences on feminist teachers as they develop their approaches to teaching. These influences include critical and radical pedagogical theories; the impact of women on the teaching profession; postmodernism; using critique and reflection within the classroom; the nature of relationships in classrooms; the role of teacher education; and developments within English education. Since I am a feminist English teacher, I draw on my own classroom experiences, both at secondary and pre-service teacher education levels. I use these experiences not as models of feminist teaching practice, but as material to reflect on ways in which a feminist teacher might move towards creating intellectual imaginings for changing her classroom work so that it contributes to an ever-evolving vision of a different feminist future. The thesis is also concerned with the processes involved in intellectual work and in becoming a feminist teacher. Within the text I have used both journal writing, and personal reflection on classroom events, to disrupt the otherwise authoritative tendencies of thesis statements. This is why, rather than coming to conclusions about the specific attributes of feminist classrooms, I suggest ways in which feminist teachers can work on their own transition towards reflective, critical and feminist classroom practices.",,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/1064",,,,"en",,,,,"University of Canterbury.

"1398","10092/806",,,,,"Berwick-Emms, Patricia E",,,,,,"1989",,,"This study attempts to answer the question of why some children fail while others succeed in the first year of school when they appear to have at least average abilities and to come from family environments which seem, on the surface at least, to provide similar developmental opportunities. The researcher observed in ten, four-year-old children's homes over a period of four days for each child and followed these intensive home observations with three-monthly, informal interviews with adult family members. Each child was observed in school intensively, on entry to school and every three months following entry until six years of age. Informal interviews were conducted with the class teachers every three months. During the 'intensive' home and school observations continuous hand-written narrative recordings of natural communication incidents were made of all the oral language and activities of the focal child, and of the language and activities of other children and adults when what they said and did was in the vicinity of the focal child. Notes were made of the location, atmosphere, body language, people present, and focal objects throughout the time of the observations. Field notes were made each night after every home, school or pre-school visit. Each child was tested with a battery of tests on entry into school at five years, at five-and-a-half years and at six years. The gathering of these different data meant a wide variety of information about the child's total ecological environment was gathered. A variety of ways for examining the data for a relationship between the behaviours and social experience of the child which occurred at home and measures of achievement in school were explored. These included a variety of language variables (e. g. exposure to question types, statement types, amount of talk) and measures of variables related to socia-economic status and home environmental factors (e.g. the HOME Scale, Caldwell & Bradley, 1979). Al though some of these variables were significantly correlated with school achievement, it was not clear that the problem of why some children succeeded in school while others failed had been satisfactorily solved. A more detailed analysis of the data was carried out which differed from most other psychological or educational studies in that it focused on the underlying structures of the natural socio-linguistic patterns of interaction in both home and school first year classrooms. The task was to describe observable social interaction in terms of the underlying structures which characterised the home subcultural experience of the children and the sub-cultural learning (acculturation) required of the children in order to successfully adapt to the school environment. The theory generated to explain this complex problem was adapted from a theory sometimes termed script theory, or schema theory. It was developed into a framework which could deal with both children's present school experience and the children's past experience of the structure of meaningful social interactions. The results showed that the underlying structure of patterns of interaction (schema) which the children brought with them from home to school did indeed cause failure for some children at school. The children's experience of patterns of interaction in the homes which were like school patterns of interaction correlated 0.91 with achievement in school. The greater the variety of school-like patterns of interaction occurring in the homes the greater a child's achievement rate was likely to be. This study has implications for classroom organisation, for the structure of classroom patterns of interaction and for young people who come from home ecological environments which are significantly different from the present classroom environment. It is argued that children are our nation's most important resource and we need to examine with great care what we are doing to promote alternative classroom environments.",,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/1066",,,,"en",,,,,"University of Canterbury.

The main goal of the thesis was to gain an understanding of their ways of coping and a second goal was to explore whether their participation in up to five mindfulness infused counselling sessions had influenced their ways of coping.

A qualitative research methodology was used to guide the thesis. Participants were interviewed about the major events in their life and how they coped with them. They were then invited to participate in five sessions of mindfulness infused counselling. Approximately five weeks after their final session had ended they were invited to one final interview to explore the influence of the sessions on their ways of coping.

Interviews were recorded and transcribed and research notes were taken of the mindfulness infused counselling sessions. Max van Manen’s method of phenomenology was adopted to interpret the narratives of the youth. Three main themes emerged from the data analysis and these are described as essences of lived coping experiences. The first captures their strong sense of community back in the refugee camp. The second presents the sense of resilience that exists among the Bhutanese former refugees. The third essence indicated the inner strengths of the participants which they said helped them deal with the challenging circumstances that life cast in their direction. This meant that their first experience of an earthquake was not considered the biggest event in their lives.

After attending the mindfulness infused counselling sessions’ participants reported positive benefits from giving non-judgemental attention to their thoughts and feelings and they found themselves dealing with their issues proactively. For some participants their ‘accepting’ attitude facilitated better control over their emotions while others reported being able to form deeper connections with nature and other people as a result of being mindful. Other participants reported being able to make peace with the events in their past and even found that they were able to forgive those who tormented their community. However, in the absence of any major event in any of the participants’ lives in the time period following their final counselling session, the research was not able to definitely conclude that using mindful-based counselling facilitates better coping in the face extremely stressful events.

There is currently very little research that focuses on the experiences of former refugee youth within New Zealand and how they utilize their capacities to deal with adversities. When this thesis commenced, the Bhutanese were the newest refugee community to be accepted for resettlement in New Zealand.

event such as a natural disaster. Young children may be at an increased risk for such mental
health problems as these catastrophic events may coincide with developmentally sensitive

symptoms have been explored, with nature-based interventions offering a potential
alternative based on two different theories that uphold the stress reducing benefits of natural
environments. To date, there are a limited number of experimental studies that have explored
the use of nature-based interventions with children, and no known research that has used a
simulated nature experience with child participants. The purpose of this study was to
investigate the effects of a simulated nature experience on the physiological and behavioural
responses of children with post-traumatic stress symptoms that experienced the Christchurch
earthquakes. A single-case research design with repeated measures of heart rate and teacherreported

that specifically investigate health care services as they are accessed by this group in
Indonesia. For policy-makers there is, therefore, a gap in vital information. The aim of
this qualitative study was to explore the experiences of nine women with disabilities
aged 18 years and older in accessing healthcare services; to find out what the impact is
of their disabilities on utilisation of healthcare services; and to enquire how information
regarding healthcare utilization can be used to identify problems with healthcare
services in Yogyakarta, Indonesia.

To capture the data, individual semi-structured interviews were conducted to elicit
women’s understandings of the description and construction of disabilities and
healthcare services in the Yogyakarta region of Indonesia. The interviews were
transcribed and analysed using Thematic Analysis. This process sought to categorise
meanings underpinning participants’ experiences, which were then drawn together as
eight key themes that highlighted inadequate healthcare system and services,
stereotyping and stigma regarding disabilities from healthcare personnel and from
society, barriers and challenges leading to exclusiveness, and positive image and selfempowerment
of women with disabilities.

The findings support previous studies finding that women with disabilities are still
marginalized in terms of access to healthcare services. It confirmed that negative
impressions within society did not impede their ability to be independent. Participants
who accepted their disabilities and received family support faced the economic,
productivity, economic, education, and health challenges, compensating through
personal achievements. This study recognized the challenges faced by women with
disabilities in accessing healthcare services and described how they manage these
challenges. Government facilitation toward healthcare services for disabilities is found to be wanting but showed some progress with the development of new programs
enhanced by the meaningful involvement of disabled people’s organizations.

The study concluded that women with disabilities must be actively involved in strategic
efforts to mainstream people with disabilities and participate in the creation of policies.
Further, the public’s perceptions of disability, as a concept requires investment in public
education to adjust society’s behaviour toward people with disabilities. Also, the
research urges the government to facilitate participation through improving access to

The purpose of the research was two-fold, first, to create a developmentally appropriate methodology for obtaining children's perceptions of character strengths, and second, if children had the capacity to talk about character strengths, to discover how they did so. Seventeen five-and-a-half to six-year-old children participated in individual interviews at their school. After a review of the methodological issues involved with obtaining children's voices in research, four developmentally appropriate strategies utilising a story, puppets, a photo and direct interviewing strategies were created. The four strategies were tested in a pilot study, revised, and then utilised in the main study. The strategies created were found to be developmentally appropriate, and assisted children to varying degrees to talk about their perceptions. At least one character strength was able to be inferred from all children's responses. Affiliation, kindness and self-regulation were the most identified character strengths. Results indicated the children were on the cusp of developing their sense of self and the ability to verbalise their positive internal attributes. Differences in the way children talked about character strengths are discussed in reference to child development and the social nature of character strengths.",,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/1068",,,,"en",,,,,"University of Canterbury.

However, the literature reviewed, revealed a growing need for finding empiric frameworks for ascertaining the materialisation of these perceptions.    Attempting to address the identified need, the study adopts ethnomethodological notions, complemented by Structural Analysis approach, to produce an alternative analytic frame called the Event Centre (EC) approach for the study of online discussion forums.  The theoretical framework chosen in this study enables the investigation of online discussion forums as systems of relations rather than aggregations of individuals. The EC approach enables the visual representation of networks of people interacting with each other and at the same time presenting the content discussed in each interaction.      Applying the EC approach to a set of 131online discussion threads, enabled the discovery of social dynamics occurring within the discussion threads. Preliminary investigations of these visually represented dynamics revealed two overarching patterns. One depicting uni directional interactions in which all participants referred to a single message and a second one depicting sequences of interactions organised in chain like patterns. The study suggests that these overarching patterns may imply different perceptions of knowledge as enacted by the participants, and hence possibly reveal different perceptions of teaching and learning through which it may be possible to detect collaborative and social constructivist processes.    The study suggests that the visual patterns introduced should be perceived as abstractions of particular events, implying their generalisability and hence possible application to different data sets.",,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/1051",,,,"en",,,,,"University of Canterbury.

Girls aged 5 to 12 years were asked who they chose to look up to, how significant their role models were to them, why they had chosen them and if they thought they thought that they could achieve their chosen model‟s achievements. Socio-cultural framework provides a useful perspective for understanding the significance of role models as they act as powerful transmitters and reinforcers of the tenets of socialization. In Social Cognitive Theory, it is claimed that children largely learn through modelling, observing and imitating significant others. Interview and task sessions including a field-mapping activity and the sorting of peer-generated photographs were conducted with 12 girls aged from 5 to 12 years from one urban school. In analysis of the interview data, it was found that family members or family substitutes were the most significant people that these girls chose and, despite the alleged pressure from popular culture, young girls in this study were able to make discerning judgements about the „hollowness‟ of characters of popular culture. They identified skills or attributes that their role models demonstrated rather than physical attractiveness, their popularity or the amount of money their fame had brought them. This study is a valid representation of what mattered to a group of young girls at one specific point in time and could indicate the value of further investigation of how to maximize the benefits of role models for young girls.",,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/1566",,,,"en",,,,,"University of Canterbury.

"1399","10092/806",,,,,"Lankshear, Colin",,,,,,"1979",,,"It is generally acknowledged that educating children entails limiting their social freedom, (or liberty), to some extent. The question is, how far can children's liberty justifiably be limited in education, and on what grounds? One approach to this issue adopted in recent educational philosophy involves the idea that development of 'free' persons constitutes a key educational ideal, if not the educational ideal itself. It is argued that children's liberty should be regulated in accordance with the ideal of developing 'free' persons. After arguing in Chapter One that freedom may be construed both as a relationship obtaining between human beings and as a form of personality development, I examine philosophically the connection between children's liberty in education and the development of 'free' persons. Some educational philosophers identify 'free' persons with rational, (autonomous) persons, and suggest that the development of reason is consistent with - and may actually presuppose - considerable restrictions on children's liberty. In particular, development of 'free' persons may require that children be initiated into the rational disciplines. Given the analysis of ""social freedom"" which I advance in Chapter Two, this requirement can be seen to constitute a serious curtailment of children's liberty. I argue that there are good reasons for challenging the view that to be a 'free' person consists in being rational, and then advance an alternative account of ""free persons"". This has quite different implications for the social freedom of children in education from those of the 'rationalist' view. Indeed, I conclude that whereas the 'rationalist' account of ""free persons"" is well-suited to justifying a considerable degree of unfreedom for children, mine more obviously lends itself to a positive end: namely, suggesting ways in which children may be offered increased social freedom by comparison with much current educational practice.",,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/1067",,,,"en",,,,,"University of Canterbury.

First, what is the range of racialised discourses that constitute the subjectivities of some Pakeha ('white'/European) women? Second, can an examination of racialised discourses be useful for present social justice and antiracist pedagogy? The research examines and analyses a range of discourses of Whiteness that contribute to the constitution of contemporary Pakeha women as racialised subjects. Central to the thesis is an analysis of dominant discourses and the contemporary challenges that analyses of racism and aspects of identification present in Aotearoa/New Zealand. The study is qualitative and draws on insights from discourse analysis theory, critical Whiteness theory and feminist approaches to theories on racism and 'white' supremacy. The analysis is located in the historicised context of contemporary Aotearoa/New Zealand where a Treaty, Te Tiriti O Waitangi, which was signed by some hapu, the tangata whenua of Aotearoa, and representatives of the British Crown in 1840, underpins current socio-cultural politics of biculturalism. The thesis argues/contends that racialised discourses, in particular various discourses of Whiteness are available to contemporary Pakeha women. The analysis is grounded in both a preliminary focus group and individual interviews of 28 Pakeha women ranging in age from 24 to 86 years, the majority of whom were aged between 40 and 55 years. With few exceptions, participants revealed that they were constituted within discourses of Whiteness through their communication choices and discursive strategies in the interviews in two distinct ways: firstly in their perceptions expressed in their narratives and recollections, and secondly in the discursive forms used in participants' interactions during the focus group and interviews. These 28 women, some of whom had participated in antiracist education such as Treaty of Waitangi workshops, utilised discourses that exposed the pervasiveness and significance of racialised discourses as they attempted express how they learned to be 'white'. Participants maintained and reproduced discourses of Whiteness that had gendered and some class influences contained in their perceptions, talk and significantly in their silences. The analysis shows how remnants of essentialist ideologies of 'race' based in the nineteenth century imperialism are constantly reworked and are seemingly invisible to those constituted within these racialised discourses, apparently giving these outdated representations no chance to fade away. Based on the analysis, critical pedagogies of Whiteness in education that incorporate an epistemic approach are suggested, which have the potential to facilitate Pakeha women's ability to conceptualise their racialised discursive location. As an outcome of this understanding, the thesis maintains that Pakeha will have the capability to strategically reconceptualise their discursive constitution in order to address the complex forms of identity, understanding of difference and representation. Furthermore, these reconceptualisations have the potential to reveal the central relationship between dominant discursive formulations and social norms and structures, a vital constituent in contemporary social justice education.",,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/1050",,,,"en",,,,,"University of Canterbury.

"2120","10092/806",,,"Strathdee, Robert Craig",,,,,,,,"2000",,,"This thesis is located within recent debates and controversies concerning the relationship between schooling and the labour market. It assesses the contribution made by the State through the National Qualifications Framework in helping poorly qualified, male school-leavers make efficient school-to-work transitions. To explore this issue the study draws on data generated in semi-structured interviews conducted with: 23 male, senior secondary school students and their parents; a selection of educators in secondary schools and private training establishments; and senior officials from Skill New Zealand. By comparing and contrasting the school-to-work transitions of the students with those of their fathers, it is shown that social networks formerly provided poorly qualified, male school students with a way to make efficient school-to-work transitions. However, economic changes of the last two decades have reduced demand in the labour market for semi-skilled and unskilled, male workers, and led to a growing number of poorly qualified, male students remaining in education as ""discouraged workers"". The emergence of the ""discouraged worker effect"", as it is referred to in the literature, suggests that the value of social networks has decreased. This decrease is problematic for the State because it has raised debate about the legitimacy of the State education system. It also suggests that traditional ways of organising schooling and structuring school-to-work transitions are no longer effective. In this context it is argued that the National Qualifications Framework is an intervention designed by the State to replace those functions previously performed by social networks. This thesis shows that the attempt to replicate these functions has increased levels of state intervention and that social networks have become commodified.",,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/1790",,,,"en",,,,,"University of Canterbury.

"2220","10092/806",,,,,"Wilson, Debra Susan",,,,,,"2001",,,"In 1973 two trial pre-registration nursing education programmes were piloted in New Zealand polytechnics. These represented an alternative to traditional hospital-sited schools of nursing. The establishment of nursing education in the tertiary sector marked a radical challenge to the cultural heritage of apprenticeship-style nursing training associated with paternal and medically-dominated health institutions. This thesis offers a Foucauldian and feminist poststructuralist analysis of discourses employed by fifteen senior nursing educators in the comprehensive registration programmes between 1973 and 1992. The women employed to teach in the comprehensive programmes faced unique challenges in establishing departments of nursing, in developing curricula that would promote a reorientation of nursing and in supporting candidates to attain their nursing registration. Through semi-structured interviews and discourse analysis methods, a set of unique characteristics shared by this group of early leading comprehensive nursing educators has emerged. The women's narratives were underpinned by discourses that centre around the valuing of education as a vehicle for emancipation and an upholding of a legitimacy of difference in nursing educators' work. The participants upheld the importance of clinical practice skills and drew on their own student nursing experiences as incentives for reforming nursing education. These nursing educators conceptualised an idealised type of graduate, and commonly employed an heroic metaphor to describe their experiences as senior comprehensive educators. Their engagement with such discourses and their shared characteristics demonstrate unique re-constitutions of power, knowledge and relations with their colleagues and clients throughout the education and health care sectors. I propose that these traits characterise the women as strategic and astute professionals who successfully negotiated the construction of comprehensive nursing programmes as a legitimate and transformative preparation for nursing registration.",,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/1845",,,,"en",,,,,"University of Canterbury.

Professionals and families have been encouraged to work together to resolve issues for children with disabilities. However, little information is available to families and professionals about how to negotiate and achieve authentic partnerships. This thesis makes an important contribution to current knowledge about partnerships by investigating how a group of people (a parent, teacher, paraprofessional and teacher/researcher) make sense of working together to support the inclusion of a student with ASD in his regular school. It is hoped that our descriptions of how we have worked together may help other professionals and families in similar situations. In saying this, the lessons we have learned are ours and are peculiar to the context in which we worked. In New Zealand partnership between professionals and families of children with disabilities is usually enacted through the Individual Education Plan (IEP) process. This study utilises an alternative partnership model, the Quality Learning Circle (QLC). The participants’ learning journeys are described and the experience of partnership for the participants is discussed. Data are drawn from a range of sources to identify those strategies that support, and barriers that hinder, the development of authentic partnerships. Findings identify those conditions that were essential for the partnership in this study to work effectively. Within this research I contrast the key dimensions of the IEP and QLC, showing the IEP process to be wanting. I suggest a partnership model that embraces a dual focus on both the student and those supporting him/her is a more effective tool for supporting the inclusion of children with disabilities. It is argued that there is a lack of recognition in current funding criteria for the difference an effective partnership can make in supporting the inclusion of students ii with severe behavioural challenges.

"2100","10092/806",,,"Boereboom, John",,,,,,,,"1999",,,"The introduction of the National Qualifications Framework and the associated assessment against Physics Unit Standards represents a major paradigm shift in senior secondary school assessment. The trend away from norm-referenced external national exams towards internal standards-based assessment has significant implications for curriculum delivery, student learning and assessment and moderation practices. The New Zealand Qualifications Authority claims that the National Qualifications Framework is a technically sound and publicly acceptable alternative to the established system. Moderation is a key plank of the Framework which aims to establish and maintain national consistency of assessment across different providers, improve assessment practices, assist in the development of assessor expertise and establish public confidence in the new qualifications. Critics have expressed doubts that the perceived national consistency and public confidence in national examinations may be lacking in internal assessment against Unit Standards. The Post Primary Teachers' Association has expressed concern that the workload associated with the assessment, reassessment and administration of Unit Standards will adversely affect the quality of curriculum delivery and student learning. The present research is an attempt to evaluate these claims and counterclaims. In this thesis the assessment and moderation of the Physics Unit Standards is used as a context to answer the question: Is assessment against the Physics Unit Standards a valid, reliable and manageable way of assessing the achievement objectives of Physics in the New Zealand curriculum? A range of qualitative and quantitative techniques was employed to monitor the quality assurance of assessment and moderation of the physics Unit Standards over a three-year period and describe its impact on teachers and students. The research established that assessment against the Physics Unit Standards was generally valid but that doubts remain about its suitability to assess conceptual learning, the micro-definition of learning outcomes and the lack of recognition of different levels of achievement. The moderation action plan was found to be effective in establishing and maintaining satisfactory comparability between schools. After the initial implementation period the workload was manageable for teachers but concerns remained about dual assessment and excessive administrative requirements. Teachers felt that the resources provided by the NZQA were generally adequate. The research identified a number of areas for improving the quality of assessment against the Level 2 Physics Unit Standards. Chief recommendations related to the incorporation of higher level skills, a broadening of the performance criteria, the recognition of levels of achievement including excellence, the elimination of dual assessment and a reduction in the amount of assessment.",,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/1765",,,,"en",,,,,"University of Canterbury.

The survey showed that schools are using a wide range of fiction, non-fiction and short story titles and these include a mixture of texts from the Western literary canon and texts by modern authors. While the quality of writing proved to be the most popular criteria for the selection of new texts the HODs also mentioned that books were being selected because they were written by New Zealanders and/or that they portrayed strong female characters, thus addressing some of the culture and gender issues raised in the English curriculum.

This research sought to evaluate an established New Zealand adolescent counselling programme (Adventure Development Counselling), and to shed light on factors associated with successful treatment outcomes. A mixed-methods research design was adopted to meet the unique challenges of studying adolescent behaviour in a community-based clinical setting. The design included administration of standardised measures of mental health and other individual and contextual variables immediately prior to, after, and six months following, treatment. In addition, qualitative data (observations and interviews) were collected on a small group of clients as they progressed through an ADC programme. Results from a series of repeated-measures analyses of variance indicated that ADC clients (n=42) achieved significant improvement on multiple indices of mental health, improvements which were largely maintained six months after completion of the programme. Further analyses identified several client factors (severity of problem behaviour, number of previous interventions) and contextual factors (parent/caregiver involvement, community support) as being significantly associated with treatment outcome (programme completion and level of improvement in mental health). The qualitative enquiry revealed the importance in the early phases of counselling of a client's readiness to make changes, and a developmentally appropriate and acceptable client-counsellor relationship. However, once youth were committed to making changes in their lives, approaches such as wilderness therapy that were action-orientated, intensive, challenging, enjoyable and group-based were perceived as particularly helpful. This thesis has contributed to the pressing need for research that clarifies the real-world applicability of counselling interventions for youth. Further, it is among the first such study applicable to the New Zealand context, contributing to improved understanding of factors associated with successful treatment outcomes for this country's youth.",,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/1791",,,,"en",,,,,"University of Canterbury.

This research set out to examine if differences existed between the practices of Christian and non-Christian therapists and the consequences if they did. A uniquely constructed questionnaire was sent to a number of therapists, but a very low return rate was received from non-Christian therapists possibly reinforcing the underlying anti-religious hostility expressed by this group. From the total of twenty seven returns received, liberal and nominal Christians were combined with the non-Christians making a (renamed) non-committed group of fifteen therapists. Twelve remained in the (renamed) committed Christian group. Data obtained from the questionnaire indicated a number of differences between the two groups. Differences were found in styles of therapy, religious beliefs, and ethical practices. Following the questionnaire, two therapists from each group were interviewed to gain further insight into the results and responses obtained. Both Christian and one non-Christian therapist were supportive of the research, but for different reasons. Christian therapists felt it was needed to educate others whereas the non-Christian therapist used it to educate herself. The remaining non-Christian therapist expressed marked hostility toward the research perhaps reflecting the opinions of the majority of therapists who did not participate in this research. Six clients also returned a questionnaire, enabling some insight from a client's perspective to be gained. This indicated that what therapists stated they would do and what either actually happened or was believed to be happening, did not always match.

"2117","10092/806",,,,,"Newcombe, Barry Stewart",,,,,,"2000",,,"When young children do not acquire language skills at an appropriate rate before entering school, the delay can impact detrimentally on later learning opportunities. Particularly during the preschool years the children's immediate caregivers, usually the parents, are likely to have the most frequent opportunities to interact through language with the children and are therefore recognised as significant intervention agents in cases where delay is evident. A review of studies which had involved training parents in the use of language facilitation skills found that training programmes are generally successful in assisting parents to acquire new skills, that parents can maintain their use of skills for some time after the training has ceased and that parents use of new skills can have a positive impact on the language development of their children. The effect of the setting in which training takes place on all of these factors has not been systematically evaluated. The present study was designed to compare the effects of home-based and centre-based training on parents' continued use, after the completion of training, of particular conversational behaviours, and on their children's language development. Parents were trained to use enthusiastic expression, scaffolding questions and scaffolding contributions of new information in conversations about past events with their children who had delayed language skills, as strategies for extending the time spent in conversational interaction with their children. Eight parent-child dyads participated in a training programme. Four received training in their homes and four in a clinic. Data on the parents' conversational skills were collected via analysis of audio-tapes of conversations carried out in generalisation settings in the home prior to training, during the training phase and after training. Data on children's participation in conversations was also obtained from the recorded conversations. The children's language development over the duration of the programme was assessed. The findings suggest that the parents who received home-based training may show greater maintenance in use of the trained skills in conversations with their children, in the weeks following the completion of the training programme, than the parents who received clinic-based training. The children of the home-trained parents generally showed the strongest improvements in their language development. These results are discussed in the context of research on the relationship between quantity of language experienced by children and their language development.

"2119","10092/806",,,,,"Smith, Richard John McKenzie.",,,,,,"2002",,,"This thesis investigates the state's education accountability organisation, the Education Review Office (ERO), as a New Public Management (NPM) agency in transition. The period for 'reviewing the reviewers' covered its creation in 1989, through its various metamorphism until the agency's last external review 2000/2001. The ERO was a 'contested' agency established in competition with other central educational agencies to provide policy advice to the Minister. The analysis is based on an extensive study of the ERO's documentation and interviews with key informants and stakeholders. The ERO's methodology, which claimed consistency and validity through an explicit position that treated all schools the same, was examined against their own data. These data represent 1,477 of the ERO's reviews over a two and a half year period and this comprised approximately 30 per cent of all the ERO's review outputs from 1996 to 1998. Findings exposed major differences in levels of compliance between rural and urban schools, between schools in lower and higher SES deciles as well as some differences between school types. An over arching finding was that a level of inequity in the current system was due to the differential impact of the ERO's reviewing system on schools. This was manifest in the variables of the geographical location of the ERO Office, school location and school size. This belies ERO's own claims to national consistency in their evaluation of schools across the country and gives rise to question the validity and reliability of the ERO's own methodology. It also examines the Office's claims to independence, impartiality and objectivity, and outlines that these are ideological assertions, which require scrutiny. Examined from a multi-theoretical perspective using state theory, neo-marxist and managerialist discourses, the concept of accountability was shown to be a movable feast having been established, firstly, in terms of professional standards, and then in terms of fiscal imperatives following NPM principles. The ERO's application of accountability has promoted market mechanisms and in conjunction with their review procedures, these have acted as control mechanism over schools, forcing them into examining short term outputs on compliance issues rather than educational improvement outcomes for students. A central theme throughout the thesis followed Offe's claim that the state was constantly seeking to resolve tensions between democracy and the economy. The ERO, as state agency, extended its designated domain of authority beyond its statutory authority which raises constitutional issues for democracy in Aotearoa/New Zealand.",,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/1789",,,,"en",,,,,"University of Canterbury.

"5707","10092/806",,,"Wright, Jocelyn Gaynor",,,,,,,,"2010",,,"Historically the early childhood and school education sectors in New Zealand have been viewed as different, since each is positioned separately in terms of Government policy and legislation. Children and families experience sector difference during transition from early childhood to school. National and international research studies point to a view of transition to school as a period of transformative change. Transitioning experiences have the capacity to transform positively and negatively according to a child’s reaction to, and their ability to cope in, a new setting. 

Research studies suggest that sectors’ transitioning practices need to focus on providing children and families with support as they adapt to the new learning environment. Environmental and relationship familiarity have dominated the direction of the support provided by teachers to date. Less attention has been given to supporting children’s continuity of learning. The fact that the two sectors operate under distinctively different curricula suggests the existence of difference in approaches to teaching and learning. This research study set out to learn about the influence of sector difference on children’s learning during transition to school and to gain insight into the ways in which teachers might support children’s continuity of learning.

The study was set in the professional development context of a group of early childhood and primary teachers participating together with a focus on early literacy teaching and learning.  The group was to look closely at the learning experiences of a group of transitioning children, while discussing and learning about curriculum practices in each sector. Constructivist perspectives underpinned this study as meaning and understandings emerged through participant conversations and interactions. The study draws together teacher insights and understandings with children’s experiences to propose ways that sector complementarity could more effectively support children’s continuity of learning. 

The questions raised in this study point to a need for practitioner research studies to be undertaken, where teachers can investigate local solutions as they strive to improve the ways they support transitioning children and families/whānau and progress implementation of the New Zealand Curriculum (2007).",,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/5299",,,,"en",,,,,"University of Canterbury.

The research was based on a collective case study with embedded cases. Data was collected from a survey using a mind map and questionnaire, as well as semi-structured face-to-face interviews. A descriptive narrative derived from the interviews with five of the participants is presented as well as cross case analysis for more than five participants. Overall the students' accounts revealed complex, inter-related and disparate data regarding their perceptions of computing. The data revealed confusion with language and terminology; a perception of variance in levels of knowledge and abilities in specific courses; stereotypical perceptions of computing; and differences in experience, relevance and choices within the computing context. The study highlights issues related to the association of computing with science and mathematics; girls' perceptions of the relevance and content of computer courses; genderrelated issues with computing; apparent lack of knowledge of computer careers and how schools label and describe their computer courses.

"2304","10092/806",,,,,"Petelo, Lorraine McAlpine",,,,,,"2003",,,"This thesis explores the ways in which students of Samoan background experience their education within the University of Canterbury. The focus is on two interconnected concerns: firstly the significance and effects of discourses in the act of constitution and subjectification of these students, and secondly, the constitutive effects of power relations that institutional policies and discursive practices produce and reproduce, in the university. In particular, I engage with feminist poststructuralist theory to explore how acts of constituting and being constituted shape these participants’ experiences, including the ways in which they resist discursive practices that constitute them as the Other. I also use this theoretical framework to attend to the interconnectedness of race, ethnicity, gender, class and culture. A further key facet of this research centres on methodological issues which arise from undertaking qualitative research, particularly in a cross-cultural setting. These include issues of theoretical position, the politics of positionality, and the contradictions and complexities of fieldwork. The findings highlight the ways in which dominant discourses and discursive practices constitute these participants as students and position them in multiple ways, within their inter-relationships of family, church community and the university. In the academy, the discourses of equal opportunity and equity have normalised the exclusive nature of the university rather than encouraging an inclusive institution. The experiences of the participants illustrate the exclusive and isolating effects of power relations, processes of normalisation, regimes of truth and power -knowledge. The four themes of collectivity, resistance, choice, and the “ivory tower” draw our attention to the possibilities for disrupting and reconfiguring dominant and interwoven discourses that have shaped these participants lives. Additionally, the concept of intersectionality moves the analysis beyond the politics of difference. Finally, although this thesis recommends that the University of Canterbury implement some practical initiatives, it proposes that the University move beyond the “barriers” approach to create a more inclusive academy, which acknowledges its role within the Pacific.",,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/1972",,,,"en",,,,,"University of Canterbury.

Use is made of literature on the labour market and the contribution of the official discourse, to develop an assessment of the current position of secondary school teachers and to provide a basis for qualitative research and analysis. It is suggested that secondary school teachers are currently being relocated within the labour market through the implementation of these reforms, although there are signs of resistance to this process. Teachers' time appears to be increasingly occupied by the tasks to do with implementation of the reforms. The new arrangements are such that student learning and student care appear to be negatively affected. This trend has been noted by teachers who are working longer hours in an effort to minimise those outcomes. In an attempt to provide a more efficient and accountable system, teachers appear to be suffering from crises of health and morale and it seems unlikely that the current situation of work overload can, continue without personal burnout or system failure.",,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/1971",,,,"en",,,,,"University of Canterbury.

"2302","10092/806",,,"Belcher, Vivienne",,,,,,,,"2006",,,"This research project examines how new entrant children and their parents experience and interpret the transition from early childhood education to primary school learning of numeracy. It investigates children's numeracy experiences in the context of the Early Numeracy Project (ENP) and within the constructivist environment of a numeracy classroom focussing on achievement of prescribed outcomes. This setting contrasts with early childhood education, where there is a greater focus on socio-cultural learning. The research reported is a qualitative investigation and uses a multiple case study approach. The participants are five children from a new entrant classroom and their parents. The main sources of data are participant observation in the classroom and unstructured interviews. The interview discussion is stimulated in some instances by photographs taken by the children and on other occasions by children demonstrating to parents the use of numeracy equipment to support their learning. The study illustrates how teacher beliefs and knowledge of numeracy pedagogy impact on the children's interpretation of numeracy learning. The findings suggest that the ENP is limiting the range of meaningful numeracy experiences in the new entrant classroom and that the Numeracy Development Project should provide further information on the pedagogy of numeracy knowledge which could bridge early childhood and primary school numeracy learning. The findings also suggest that professional development in the form of coaching should support teachers following their introductory year of ENP. In this study the primary school teacher and parents had little opportunity to explore the philosophy and discuss the content of the children's early childhood education and experiences. Consequently the children were making the transition to school without the adults in their lives understanding the extent of the children's transition. This study's focus is the transition to learning school numeracy. The study also finds that during the children's first term at school parents gauged the content of the numeracy programme from the children's play at home. Parents were impressed with their children's enthusiasm and progress. During this period communication with the school about the children's numeracy learning was largely initiated by parents and there was no opportunity for them to be involved in the numeracy programme at school.",,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/1970",,,,"en",,,,,"University of Canterbury.

Participants with varying functional asthma severity were recruited at age 5 from a larger community study (the Children’s Learning Study).

"2230","10092/806",,,,,"Okamura, Yasuko",,,,,,"2008",,,"This thesis explores the experiences of Japanese native speaker teachers teaching Japanese in New Zealand. The main purpose of this study is to analyse and understand their experiences, to evaluate the extent to which their experiences endorse previous research in the area, and to identify aspects of their experiences that may be universal to immigrant teachers in general or specific to Japanese immigrant teachers in the New Zealand context. 

This study therefore adopts a qualitative research approach. Findings emerge mainly from the analysis of interviews with twenty-five Japanese native speaker teachers and are supplemented by fifty-two written survey responses. Major themes include ways that the teachers’ backgrounds influenced their career development decision-making process; differences that teachers expected and found in teaching in New Zealand; difficulties that teachers encountered in New Zealand schools; adjustments that teachers made to fit into teaching in New Zealand; adaptation strategies that they adopted to work effectively in the New Zealand cultural environment; and the teachers’ perceptions of working well as Japanese language teachers in New Zealand.   

The main findings reveal that the teachers confronted difficulties and challenges similar to those of all beginning teachers, but in their case, specific values they held enabled them to develop useful teaching strategies peculiar to them and make successful adaptations to the New Zealand teaching environment. This successful outcome was influenced by their additional learning experience of having gone through the complexity in teacher development as immigrants. 

Previous research demonstrated that teachers’ experiences and their values influenced curriculum making, the teaching process and classroom organisation. My research extended these findings by describing more specifically the values and strategies that my participant teachers adopted to teach New Zealand students. In addition to the suggestions made for other teachers, several recommendations are made for future research. This study concluded that immigrant teachers need to continue their learning, utilise skills previously acquired in their own countries, and participate in the new society to make successful adaptation.",,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/1905",,,,"en",,,,,"University of Canterbury.

"2245","10092/806",,,,,"Henderson, Jacqueline Mary Therese",,,,,,"2001",,,"This thesis reviews the literature on the development of infant sleep to
establish whether relevant criteria for planning primary preventive intervention of
infant sleep disturbance (ISD), derived from Mrazek and Haggerty's (1994) criteria
for evaluating prevention interventions, have been met. It concludes that the
methodological and conceptual limitations of this literature have prevented the two
most critical criteria from being met. These are, when preventive intervention should
occur, and what specific infant and parent factors should be targeted.
In order to address these criteria a prospective longitudinal repeated measures
design was employed. Parents of 75 normally developing infants, 52 from the age of 1
month, and 23 from the age of 2 months completed sleep diaries for six consecutive
days, each month until the infant had reached 12 months of age. All night, infra-red,
time-lapse video recording (TLVR) was also obtained for the purpose of reliability.
There were two separate studies. The first challenged traditional definitions of
sleeping through and demonstrated an 8 hour criterion to be behaviourally meaningful
and developmentally realistic. It then investigated the norms for this developmental
task. The results indicated the optimal time for prevention to be within the first 2
months. By six months two discrete group of infants were identified, one group with
emerging sleep disturbance and the other demonstrating settled sleep. Stability in
infants' relative sleep scores was demonstrated across the first 12 months although
many parents intervened.
The second study tested the predictions from a developmental model (France
& Blampied, 1999) which suggested the proximal parent and infant risk factors that
precede and predict lSD. At 1 month a discriminant function analysis identified 3
variables that correctly classified 90.4% of the infants into either a group of infants
with emerging sleep disturbance or a group without sleep disturbance at 6 months of
age. Two of these 3 variables also predicted group membership at 12 months.
This research has filled some critical gaps in the research base by identifying
parent and infant factors to be targeted, and the optimal time for prevention. It
empirically supports and extends the developmental model, thereby providing a
framework for planning primary prevention of ISD. Several directions for future
research are presented.",,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/1897",,,,"en",,,,,"University of Canterbury.

"1388","10092/806",,,,,"Hussain, Hanin Binte",,,,,,"2007",,,"This thesis explores two problems: (1) how early childhood teachers can manage professional development and change in their own settings, and (2) how to create a thesis. Both facets of the thesis emerge from the professional development in Active Movement that the teachers and I co-constructed at our early childhood centre between April 2005 and June 2006. This thesis sets out to test the main idea that having a theory of change for teachers' professional development can help teachers negotiate complex change and craft their own professional development solutions. It uses stories as a key facet of its methodology and presents stories of professional development and change related to five inter-weaving learning journeys. The learning journeys relate to (1) my learning journeys as a professional development coordinator and (2) as a researcher, (3) the overall learning journeys and (4) & (5) teachers' collective learning journeys to implement two different but related practices in Active Movement. The stories provide a range of professional development solutions and change at individual and collective levels from which different theories of change can be derived. From these stories, I identify three theories of change as well as the complex changes we negotiated and the professional development solutions we crafted. In identifying the theories of change, the complex changes and the professional development solutions, this thesis supports the main idea and argues that teachers can develop a theory of change to manage professional development and change in their own settings. This thesis argues that a theory of change is a set of strategies that address the local conditions. It suggests that the process of developing a theory of change can include articulating local conditions and creating strategies that support and guide the change in ways that address these local conditions. It also suggests that recognising what counts as local conditions and strategies can help teachers develop their own theories of change. In creating the strategies to support the change effort, it is important to identify the purpose of the strategies, their underlying values and relationships, and the day-to-day realities that constrain the change effort. At the same time, it is important to identify how different strategies inter-relate to help us manage the tensions that can arise from these relationships. This thesis argues that theories of change can include multiple and embedded theories of change, that we can create theories of change as plans or explanations of change or as dynamic theories of change that emerge from the inter-play between plans and explanations. This thesis also argues that there are different ways to articulate our theories of change and that there are limits to the extent to which we can or should articulate them. It also argues that the theories of change we create and use for our change efforts depend on the nature of the change. A theory of change that embodies the process of emergence is useful for managing professional development and change efforts that have a high degree of complexity and uncertainty and whose end goals are initially unknown. This thesis also suggests that creating the role of a professional development or change coordinator can help centres manage the knowledge used and created in the professional development or change effort in ways that benefit individuals, groups and the centre. This thesis also argues that (1) the thesis investigation is my personal professional development and represents my learning journeys to create a thesis, (2) the thesis report constitutes a theory of change for the thesis investigation, and (3) the thesis is experimental in the way that it is reported. This thesis proposes other possible investigations related to the idea of theories of change; (1) to develop an Active Movement community of practice within the wider early childhood sector, and (2) to investigate the role of theories of change in everyday teaching and learning. Finally, it uses the notion of value creation to suggest ways to create added value for the teachers and the Centre, for Sport and Recreation New Zealand and for myself.",,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/1056",,,,"en",,,,,"University of Canterbury.

"2455","10092/806",,,,,"Hardie, Gillian",,,,,,"2005",,,"Sleep disturbances are extremely common among children with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) and are reported to occur more frequently than in typically developing children. These sleep problems are likely to be highly stressful for family members and may have adverse effects on the well-being of both the child and parents. Unfortunately, there is a paucity of research investigating the development and efficacy of behavioural management strategies to treat the sleep disturbances of children with ADHD. This study used a multiple baseline design across participants to examine the effects of individualized behavioural family interventions in treating the inappropriate bedtime behaviour and sleep disturbances presented by four children (aged 5-11 years) diagnosed with ADHD. Assessment data suggested that sleep disturbances were reinforced and maintained by parental attention. The behavioural strategies implemented to treat the sleep problems were comprised of standard extinction procedures involving differential reinforcement of inappropriate and appropriate behaviours, positive reinforcement programmes, a structured positive bedtime routine and a response cost procedure. Results showed that the multiple sleep problems presented by these four children, including bedtime disturbances, sleep onset delay, night wakings, bedtime non-adherence and co-sleeping, were reduced as a function of their respective individual behavioural interventions. Sleep and behavioural improvements were mostly maintained at 3 months follow-up. Generalized positive effects on the child's daytime behaviour, changes in parental mood, increased parental sleep and increased confidence in parenting skills were also reported following completion of the sleep intervention programmes.

The study used both qualitative and quantitative methods. The qualitative component consisted of six questions presented to caregivers at individual or couple interviews. Major themes identified in the response to these questions indicated that participants are generally feeling under-supported and disrespected by social services staff, overwhelmed by the range, severity and difficulty of their children's behaviours, isolated in their role, unable to access relief care and a lack of provision and support for training in local areas. Participants also indicated a desire for training on the etiology and management of difficult child behaviours, managing birth family contact and legal issues relating to allegations and permanency. Areas of current support that caregivers indicated are useful included the support provided by Caregiver Liaison Social Workers, school and early childhood education staff, general practitioners, and other caregivers  The quantitative component consisted of a survey covering basic demographic information. A modified child behavioural checklist, containing selected items from the 'Child Behaviour Checklist' and the 'Assessment Checklist for Children' was constructed to assess the range of problematic child behaviours caregivers are experiencing and how prepared they felt in dealing with them. Findings indicated that the participants are experiencing a range of severe behaviours well outside the normal experience of parents but are consistent with those reported in the international literature for children in care. The PSI was used to assess caregiver's stress levels relating to their parenting role. Participants reported high levels of stress particularly in the child domain of the PSI with sub-scales in the high to clinical range across this domain. Implications of theses results are discussed including implications for the caregivers, social welfare practices and the development of future training packages for caregivers.",,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/1061",,,,"en",,,,,"University of Canterbury.

Based on a mix of internal and external assessment against achievement standards, it represents a complete break away from previous norm-reference based qualifications. NCEA was first introduced in 2002 starting at Level 1, involving Year 11 students in their first year in senior secondary school education.    The implementation of Level 1 NCEA related assessment changes involved a considerable mind shift in assessment practice for teachers, especially for those with no previous standards-based assessment experience. The use of achievement standards impacted not only on how teachers gathered evidence and made judgements in relation to student work, but also on the ways in which they conducted recording and reporting, and managed procedures such as reassessment and moderation.     Change of this nature by necessity, at least short term, was always bound to give rise to implementation concerns and challenges. The focus of this research is on investigating geography teachers' perceptions regarding the implementation of the Level 1 NCEA related geography achievement standards.

investigate how students with disabilities experience the
academic and personal support services at the University of
Canterbury and what changes, if any, students would like to make
in order to have their personal and educational needs better met.
Five students with disabilities were interviewed in order to
identify the issues confronting students with disabilities and
incorporate these into a questionnaire. All 295 students who
identified as disabled at the tertiary institution were sent the
questionnaire and 70 students responded. Individual meetings were
held with four staff members and publications on provisions for
students with disabilities at the University were reviewed to
establish what the University claims is available so that this could
be compared with students' accounts of their experiences.
The information from University staff and the promotional
material showed that there were a variety of resources and
procedures in place in order to meet the needs of students. Thus
the University indicated an active willingness to meet the needs of
students with disabilities. The majority of students with
disabilities reported that most of their academic and personal
needs were met at the University. However the majority of
students also put forward recommendations regarding changes that
could be made so that their needs could be better met. Students
adopted strategies to cope with the barriers that confronted them
at University. This research found that students with disabilities felt personally
responsible for the barriers that confronted them. This was
evidenced by the strategies students used to confront these
barriers and the medical model of disability which influenced
resource provision for students with disabilities. I argue that a
social model of disability needs to be adopted if the underrepresentation
of students with disabilities is to be addressed and
the University's legal obligations to provide for these students is
to be fulfilled.",,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/2293",,,,"en",,,,,"University of Canterbury.

including 'skills training for employment', promotion of 'lifelong learning', and 'second
chance learning'. It poses the question: ""Is TOP training a place of opportunity or a
'collecting house for end of the line students'?""
Eighteen TOP trainees were surveyed over a six-month period to elicit their perceptions of
opportunities, if any, in TOP. Four semi-structured interviews, which were tape recorded
and transcribed, tracked the trainees' progress and career pathways on their vocational skills
courses and beyond.
Features that were perceived as opportunities were the appeal ofvocational skills, structure,
routine, social interaction and a financial security, personal and vocational challenges, these
factors increased confidence and self-esteem. Tutor and training centre networking with
employers was the greatest single factor which aided people into employment. Trainees set
and achieved a wide range of personal and vocational goals.
The study identified limitations in government policy for TOP when compared to the
trainees experiences, and itemised barriers to the promotion of lifelong learning and
opportunities for second chance learners. A considerable amount of positive personal and
vocational trainee development was not identified in the conventional indicators of success
used for reviewing courses.
The study goes on to suggest ways of building on current government policy to maximise
opportunities for TOP participants and alternative measures for reporting course results to
more accurately reflect the trainees progress on TOP courses.

"2698","10092/806",,,"Lewis, Patricia Anne",,,,,,,,"1998",,,"This study investigated the art process in early childhood education in two early
childhood centres in Christchurch, New Zealand. The purpose of the study was to
examine the provisions teachers made for children in the early childhood art area, to
observe how they guided children through the art process and to find out what
eventually happened when an art product was completed.
The study employed a qualitative design. It involved unstructured interviews with six
qualified early childhood teachers. Settings for participant observations included, a
childcare centre, a kindergarten, and the Early Childhood Support service. Relevant
documentation was also collected. Three themes eventually emerged for consideration.
The themes were, planning for art experiences, verbal and non-verbal expression of art
and the product.
The first section of results dealt with teachers' involvement in programme planning,
setting up the art area and providing materials and activities. The contribution of Te
Whaariki (1996) in the planning process used by the teachers was also discussed. The
second section concerned the participation, of both the teachers and the children, in art
expression. It examined the dialogue the teachers used when talking to children about
art, how the teachers worked with the children in the art area, and the skills the children
demonstrated when involved in the art process. The third section of results concerned
the final product, and the value and meaning placed on the children's work of art by the
teachers, the parents, and the children themselves.
The results of this research suggested that the teachers predominantly used
developmental theory in their work with children in the art area. Teachers attempted to
imitate some of the elements found in the Reggio Emilia preschools, but did not appear
to have complete knowledge of the theoretical underpinnings of the Discipline Based
Art Education approach used by these schools. Teachers were aware of the importance
1
of including Te Whaariki in their planning of art experiences, in centres, and used the
document as a guide, to facilitate their work. Implications were for increased in-service
training for teachers in the area of art education theory and practice.
The early childhood teachers in this study expressed a variety of views, both implicit
and explicit, about artistic expression and children's learning. Their practice in the art
area, generally confirmed connections with the theories they articulated and revealed
gaps in art education in early childhood. The implementation of Te Whaariki has
impacted early childhood teaching throughout New Zealand and has been instrumental
in shaping teachers' practical work in the art area. Specific training in the area of art
education may serve to enhance teachers abilities to teach art to young children at a
developmentally appropriate level, and may give them the confidence necessary to
provide art programmes which contribute to the richness of children's experiences.",,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/2294",,,,"en",,,,,"University of Canterbury.

"2705","10092/806",,,"Wood, Pamela Janet",,,,,,,,"1992",,,"School inspectors were key figures in the
development of education in New Zealand. This thesis is
a study of the North and South Canterbury inspectorate
from the establishment of a national system of primary
education in 1877 to the transfer of the inspectorate
from Board to Department control in 1916. It focusses
on the inspectors' professional role rather than
attempting a group biography.
This thesis argues that the four decades of the
inspectorate's history fell into three distinct periods,
characterised by turmoil in the first, stability in the
second and rapid change in the third. The kinds of men
considered suitable for holding inspectorships changed
in each period.
Inspectors were uniquely placed to influence
educational policy and their two annual visits to each
school, for inspection and examination, enabled them to
see it implemented in the classroom. Despite the
intention that Board inspectors would carry out the
wishes of the central Department, a legislative anomaly
allowed them to interpret Departmental regulations as
they saw fit.
Foucault's ideas of disciplinary power through
hierarchical observation and normalising jUdgement
provide a framework for locating inspectors within the
education system. In their role as annual examiners
3
they were unwilling agents of disciplinary power,
resisting the Department's measurement of educational
success solely through examination statistics. Yet
their annual unannounced visit to each school, their
close inspection of the teacher's records and of the
school's tone, discipline and cleanliness, brought both
children and teachers firmly within an extensive and
permanent field of surveillance.
This thesis examines these two aspects of the
inspectors' role in detail. It describes their ideas of
reasonable efficiency in teaching and the preparation
and continuing education of teachers. It explores their
role in creating a safe and healthy educational
environment for training intelligent and loyal citizens.
And it analyses their success in guiding the educational
development of their districts.",,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/2292",,,,"en",,,,,"University of Canterbury.

"2695","10092/806",,,"Elsworth, Elizabeth",,,,,,,,"2003",,,"This qualitative study investigates how ten parents and six teachers of children with a
disability negotiate and enact partnership in New Zealand primary schools. In-depth
interviews were conducted to examine their experiences of working together and to identify
the factors that they considered essential for supporting an effective partnership. Data were
also drawn from school policies and documents describing the New Zealand Special
Education 2000 policy documents.
Since the inclusion of children with disability in regular classrooms there has been an
increased recognition of the important role of parents as partners in their child's education.
The New Zealand Special Education 2000 Policy Guidelines have clearly articulated a vision
of partnership between parents/caregivers and education providers. These guidelines promote
partnership as a means to overcoming barriers to learning and ensuring successful learning
outcomes for children with a disability. For parents, these guidelines potentially signaled a
new way of working with their child's school. Parents had high hopes that a partnership,
which involved them in sharing knowledge and decision-making, could contribute to better
resources and learning opportunities for their child.
While the teachers and parents in this study viewed partnership as a desirable outcome, many
found the process of negotiating partnership to be problematic. Frequently they were
challenged by their different understandings and positionings, and the knowledge/power
dynamics in their interactions. Parents found that their knowledge was not sufficiently valued
and that there was little clarity about how to work in partnership with their child's class
teacher. Teachers were required to meet a diverse range of educational needs, and to fulfill the
expectations of parents and the Ministry regarding partnership. However, many found that
they lacked training in working with parents, and few had any training that supported them to
understand and meet the special needs of children with disabilities.
This study shows how multiple discourses of partnership and of disability shaped
teacher/parent interaction and created barriers to achieving effective partnership. While the
Special Education 2000 policy documents reflect a democratic discourse, through promoting
the democratic participation of parents, this study shows that professional discourse continues to dominate interactions between parents and teachers, and maintains barriers to achieving
effective partnership. Through professional discourse, teachers tended to position parents'
knowledge as secondary to their own. Parents found that their child's particular learning
needs were not always recognized by their class teacher and the necessary conditions for their
success in learning were not always provided. Parents had found that, when their views
differed from teachers, there were few structures that enabled them to negotiate different
perspectives. Partnership, for these parents, had been a stressful experience, involving
considerable personal cost.
While this study identifies barriers to forming effective partnership, it also highlights the
factors which parents and teachers found helpful in achieving an effective partnership. Parents
wanted a partnership with clearly stated roles, responsibilities, systems and procedures so that
they knew what they could, or could not, reasonably expect from the school. They wanted the
school to be the proactive party in initiating meetings. Parents also wanted the school to make
their child's learning programme and progress more visible, and to value the knowledge they
wanted to share about their child.
This study shows that teachers need to recognize the position of power they hold in
relationship to parents and what steps they can take to minimize this power differential. For
parents and teachers to work effectively together, the many dimensions of partnership need to
be recognized, made visible and critically examined by each school. The negotiation and
enactment of partnership may continue to expose different perspectives between parents and
teachers. However, these differences can be viewed as a valuable opportunity for learning
how to achieve better partnership. Through such a partnership, the educational needs of
children with a disability could be more effectively met.",,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/2290",,,,"en",,,,,"University of Canterbury.

Use is made of socialist-feminist and labour market
theories in order to develop a qualified reserve army of
labour thesis which along with an analysis of the various
ways in which power can be exercised, serves as a theoretical
base to guide empirical research.
Empirical study using historical documents and
journals to trace the implications of state policy for women

as to why women teachers in the primary service have
minimal access to power and decision-making.
It is suggested that women's access to power within
the primary education system is obstructed by problems
relating to personnel and structure within the school
itself, the primary teachers' professional union, and at
the level of the state. In order to overcome these problems,
affirmative action is needed to promote the interests
of women teachers. This needs to be pursued simultaneously
with efforts to alter the power structure within the
primary schools.
By moving towards a more democratic form of school
organisation, present inequalities in the access to,

"2423","10092/806",,,,,"Surtees, Nicola Jane",,,,,,"2006",,,"This qualitative study explored teacher talk and practice about and around sexuality in early childhood education. The study focused on the operation of
teacher discourses of sexuality within early childhood centres, and the  subsequent regulation of sexualities.
Open-ended individual interviews and a group interview were conducted with three teachers. In an analysis of the interview findings, the teachers' talk and practice about and around sexuality is placed within a wider framework of
heteronormativity. The context of heteronormativity serves to create barriers to, and/or narrow options for teachers' talk and practice about and around sexuality, while reducing opportunities for acknowledgement of diverse identities. Any such reduction sits uneasily alongside both prevailing liberal discourses demanding recognition of difference and diversity, and the inclusive ideals central to the national early childhood curriculum: Te Whaariki: He Whaariki Maatauranga moo ngaa Mokopuna 0 Aotearoa. Early Childhood Curriculum (Ministry of Education, 1996b). Connections between teachers' talk and practice, heteronormativity, and Foucault's concepts of power, surveillance and normalisation are explored. Three key findings are discussed. The first key finding suggests that children/bodies and sexuality are centred as normal by and through discourse. The second key finding suggests that the teachers' talk and practice consciously or sub-consciously, takes up, enacts and is governed by particular discourses as a form of regulation of sexuality. Regulation of sexuality transpired through the practice of specific management strategies. The third finding draws attention to the endpoints of discourses that centre and manage - the marginalisation, resistance towards, and silencing of sexuality in early childhood education; and, the marginalisation of children/bodies. These endpoints highlight absences that make problematic both teachers' talk and
practice focused on children's learning about sexuality, and the expression of,
and honouring of, sexualities. The study findings, in troubling notions of sexuality and accepted pedagogical
practices in early childhood education, raise questions about the implications
of discourses that are productive of marginalising endpoints and absences. A
case is put forward for 'being bad' and risk taking for both the teacher in the
early childhood centre, and within pre-service teacher education, in order to
create new possibilities for inclusion and to enable a way forward in relation
to sexualities matters.",,,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/2061",,,"en",,,,,"University of Canterbury.

It considers the aims of these programmes and describes the ways they illustrate aspects of biculturalism. It examines the concerns faced by those developing and administering such programmes in contemporary New Zealand society. As well as an extensive literature review, data was collected through interviews with interpretive practitioners involved in both long-standing and recent programmes, museum ethnologists,
Department of Conservation staff, and archaeologists as well as others with specialised skills in this area. Analysis is based on examination of the ways in which interpretation is affected by the policy, values and practices of their context. The effects on interpretation of assimilative practice are contrasted with an emerging bicultural practice. Models of assimilation, market ethos and biculturalism are examined in terms of Freire's analysis of oppressive and liberating societies. Case studies highlight some of the issues raised when pursuing bicultural practice within an increasingly market dominated
society. Findings indicate that such programmes are beneficial as an aspect of bicultural education in heightening the visibility of Maori for the general public, and introducing values, processes and a different way of approaching material from what has been accepted by many as the monocultural
norm. Furthermore and importantly they can represent the return of provenance to material and ownership of material and sites to Maori. However the study indicates there are differing perceptions on the part of Maori and Pakeha interpretive agents in relation to priorities over issues, cultural values, and ways of viewing material.
Furthermore the demands of an increasingly market driven economy places pressures on the development of such interpretive programmes.",,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/2060",,,,"en",,,,,"University of Canterbury.

four themes curriculum, socialisation, professionalism and power.
Two methods of data collection were used: the in-depth interview, the
principle research method, which produced critically reflective
dialogue, and structured questionnaires which provided a chance to
generalise the data to the wider nursing student population.
This study differs from previous studies of professional
socialisation by addressing the subjective experiences of nursing
students as they complete their education. It emphasises the influence
both formal and informal education has on the students' perceptions of
nursing. It is contended that explicit acknowledgement of this
influence is critical in order to understand the development of these
perceptions.
The results of the study revealed constraints experienced by the
students within their nursing education. It demonstrated that the
environments in which this education takes place influence nursing
students' interpretations of their social worlds. Contradictions reported
between the idealised, client centred objectives of the nursing courses
and the actual practices of nurses within bureaucratic institutions,
exemplify a socialisation process which promotes acceptance of
institutional constraints on professional practice. The evidence
suggested that the dominant ideologies, or hidden curriculum, of both
the polytechnic and the hospital systems socialise the nursing student
into existing hierarchical structures.
It is argued that both nursing educators and students need to
openly acknowledge the relationship between the overt and covert
aspects of the curriculum, if nursing education is to encourage
graduates to be critically reflective of their professional practice. Lack
of acknowledgement of the hidden curriculum exacerbates the
difficulties students encounter when attempting to challenge existing
institutional practices. Discussion is made of the study's implications for
programme and curriculum development and suggestions for further
research are identified.",,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/2427",,,,"en",,,,,"University of Canterbury.

My specific focus is to make connections between policy and practice in relation to the inclusion of students with disabilities in a secondary school setting. Through using an ethnographic qualitative methodology I am able to gain an in-depth understanding of the perspectives of participants at all levels within the state education system, (students, school staff, parents, support agencies and state representatives), particularly those directly involved within the school. Data was collected by way of participant observation, semi-structured interviews and document analysis. Data analysis was ongoing throughout the study, through a method of modified analytic induction. My analysis draws on the theoretical perspectives of interpretivism and radical humanism, both of which are underpinned by a social construction epistemology. This provides the necessary theoretical link for understanding the connections between macro- and microlevel social action in terms of policy intentions and classroom practices. My findings serve to highlight the inconsistencies, contradictions and points of congruence between the New Zealand Curriculum Framework and Special Education 2000, the intentions of the policy makers and classroom implementation. Six themes emerge from the findings. These are Walking The Tightrope: issues of contestability; Privileged Knowledge; Blurring The Edges; Power Struggles; Maintaining Normality; and Excluding The Included. These themes demonstrate that a shift by the state to utilitarianism diverged from principles of inclusion that were simultaneously being promoted in the curriculum documents. The conflicting messages at a state level were being replicated within the school, and thus the status quo was maintained because the only inclusion models the school had available to them were those based on traditional special educational ideologies. The result was a context of continued exclusion, which continued to permeate through to daily classroom practices.",,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/1065",,,,"en",,,,,"University of Canterbury.

The study considers the nine student teachers' own experiences and views, and bases the points of reflection around their contextual experiences in schools during their one year post-graduate course of study at the Christchurch College of Education. It examines the skills and knowledge bases that the selected cohort of student teachers and their respective associate (supervising) teachers view as being essential for effective teaching and learning to occur in the secondary music curriculum. It also compares these responses to the competencies stated in the Music Education course outlines for the Secondary Programme at the Christchurch College of Education. The Music Education courses were taught by the researcher, and so a critical action research approach was employed. The research method involved the student teachers in completing three questionnaires, one after each practicum experience. The questionnaires determined each student teacher's perceived confidence with specific course competencies. Changes during the course of study are discussed and individuals are compared. Each student teacher also participated in a semi-structured interview after each practicum where they reflected on their teaching experiences in more depth. At the end of the course, the student teachers shared their views and reviewed the Music Education courses within the context of a group video, and through written course evaluations. Associate teachers, who supervised individual student teachers during their teaching practices, commented on student teacher progress through written reports. Other local secondary music teachers participated in a questionnaire aimed at investigating connections in perception between the ""expert' and the ""novice"" music teacher.
This thesis is based on a three dimensional conceptual model for teacher education: a
personal dimension, where the student teachers articulate their beliefs, backgrounds
and philosophies about music teaching and learning; a practical dimension, where
pedagogical content knowing is put into operation; and a political dimension, where
social, and cultural factors are considered in relation to their beliefs and practices.
Tensions between these dimensions are discussed and analysed.
Conclusions drawn, and recommendations made, focus on this construction of
professional knowledge through the convergence of personal and ecological
frameworks, and a vision for teacher education curriculum courses is given.",,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/2095",,,,"en",,,,,"University of Canterbury.

Using qualitative research methodology, two semi-structured interviews were conducted across two urban sites with ten young lesbian women between the ages of fourteen and twenty-five. Various feminist theories and contemporary adolescent developmental theories were drawn on to provide a context within which the participants' experiences could be situated. The research revealed that with one notable exception. Secondary schools do little to support young women who do not conform to the heterosexual norm. As a result the participants felt marginalised and excluded both within the school curriculum and from their peers and teachers. Many felt compelled to suppress their sexual identity.

"2480","10092/806",,,"Cowan, Stephanie",,,,,,,,"1991",,,"The study investigated the contribution of information leaflets to
advice and practice in infant care within the wider context of parent
learning. Two leaflets about reducing possible risks of cot death
were of particular interest. The practices selected for study were
infant feeding, sleep position and warmth assessment choices. As well
the clothing, bedding and heating arrangements of babies in bed at
night were described and compared with practices of Christchurch
parents in 1986.
Ninety seven maternity patients at Christchurch Women's Hospital were
interviewed in hospital and 53 of these, who were new mothers, were
interviewed again at home when their babies were about three months
old. The hospital interviews gathered information about promoted
behaviours, sources from which written and verbal advice were received,
women's perceptions of written and verbal advice received and their
intended choices for infant feeding, sleep position and warmth
assessment. The home interviews gathered information about written and
verbal advice sought and received since the baby's birth, women's
perceptions of this advice and of their learning experiences, actual
infant feeding, sleep position and warmth assessment choices. Evidence
of behaviours was obtained by three consecutive days of diary recording
for infant feeding and sleep position, and by observation for infant
warmth assessment. Details of clothing, bedding and heating
arrangement for babies in bed at night were also gathered. Promoted behaviours were breastfeeding , the side sleeping position, and
to a lesser degree, feeling the torso to assess an infant's warmth.
These behaviours were consistent with those promoted in the cot deathrelated
leaflets. Doctors in particular, and health professionals in
general were women's most trusted sources for advice about infant care.
Written information reported to have been seen was generally reported
to have been read by hospital subjects and readers were representative
of the total sample. Materials in the Plunket information pack were
well read and more than half the home subjects reported reading most of
the materials. The cot death related leaflets were amongst those most
often reported to have been read (by more than three quarters of
subjects), perceived to have been helpful and thought worth
recommending to other parents. Hospital subjects' intended choices of
infant care were breastfeeding for 85, the side sleeping position for
89, and feeling the torso to assess infant warmth for 34 subjects. By
the time their babies were three months old a significant number of
home subjects had changed from their intended practices. Twenty five
women had changed from fully breastfeeding (chi²=26.0, df 1, p<O.OO5),
16 from intending the side sleep position only to including the back
(chi²=21.0, df 1, p<O.005) and 31 subjects changed to feeling the torso
to assess infant warmth (chi²=40, df 1, p<O.005). Knowing that the
prone sleep position was a risk factor for cot death was the reason
given by 17 of 19 experienced mothers for changing from choosing the
prone sleep position for their last baby to choosing the side or back
for the new baby. There were significant changes in clothing and
bedding practices for home subjects compared to practices in 1986 with
1990 parents more likely than 1986 parents to have used 6 or less
layers of total coverings on their infants in bed at night (chi²=20.9, df 1, p<O.OO5). Readers of the cot death related leaflets were
representative of the total hospital sample and were more likely than
non-readers to have had an intended warmth assessment method (chi²=9.3,
df 1, p<O.OO5). Actual infant sleep position and thermal care
practices of readers of the two leaflets were consistent with those
promoted in the leaflets.
The study's findings suggest that information leaflets have made a
useful contribution to advice and practice in infant care. In this way
leaflets have the potential to contribute to reducing infant deaths and
they deserve an important place in education programmes to improve
infant care and prevent cot deaths.",,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/2125",,,,"en",,,,,"University of Canterbury.

"2525","10092/806",,,,"Mills, Colleen",,,,,,,"1991",,,"This study explored the nature of the learning approaches used by a group of
tertiary students when learning from text and their associated written test
outcomes. Ninety second year university students were studied in two
separate situations and the findings from this study were used to predict the
learning behaviour of a sub-group of 23 in a third situation. The method
employed reflected a second order perspective, incorporating the Approaches
to Studying Inventory (Ramsden, 1983) and written retrospective reports on
learning behaviour.
The combination of the learner's motive, focus and the degree of strategy
elaboration emerged as the most effective means of describing students'
learning approaches. Six distinct learning approaches were identified by
considering each participant's reported learning behaviour in relation to
these dimensions. An analysis of reported learning approaches using this
classification scheme revealed considerable intra- and inter-situational
variability in learning approach. However, some forms of stability within
this variability were identified suggesting that a student's learning approach
can exhibit both variability and consistency.
Four distinctive learning outcomes were identified from the written test
responses. These differed in focus, level of elaboration, degree of integration,
extent of overview, evidence of rote learning and extent of personal
synthesis. When each students' test outcome was compared to their reported
learning approach to learning discrepancies were found which suggested that
approach was not the sole determinant of learning outcome.
When the data from the Approaches to Studying Inventory were compared
with that from the retrospective reports made by students no consistent
patterns emerged. This is consistent with the conclusion that learning
approach is an individual, context specific response which is not able to be
described using instruments which assume uniformity in approach. From the findings of this study a nascent theory of tertiary student learning
behaviour when learning from text and an 'effective learner' profile were
developed.",,,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/2175",,,"en",,,,,"University of Canterbury.

workforce and computer training. The sample comprised 29 Canterbury employers
and 140 trainees from the Training Opportunities Programmes (TOPS) aged 19 to 69.
The Questionnaire survey of Canterbury Employers was designed to obtain
information about the impact an ageing workforce may have on businesses, the value
of older workers and the influence of computer training in the workplace, as this has
been seen as a significant issue in the employability of older workers. The
Questionnaire survey of TOPS Trainees was compiled to obtain information about
trainees' views on work and computer training. Both questionnaires were sent to the
participants by post.
Results indicated that Canterbury employers (N=29) did not envisage that
there would be a significant impact on their organisations in the short term as a result
of the ageing workforce, however, they expected positive influences of the ageing
workforce on their organisations. Responses also showed that Canterbury employers
valued the skills and attributes of their older workers and they were willing to provide
computer training courses that were job-related. Older workers are regarded as having
useful experiences, being loyal to the organisation, having low absenteeism and
having a strong work ethic.
Responses from TOPS trainees (N=140) were divided into two groups: the
older trainees (40 years of age and older) and the younger trainees (less than 40 years
old). 84% had previously been in full-time work. Older trainees had more work
experiences, primarily as either labourers or office workers. Findings indicated there
was no significant difference between older and younger trainees on the General
Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12) in terms of psychological health. On the Work
Aspect Preference Scale (WAPS), older and younger trainees differed significantly in
the Life Style, which measures the effect that employment might have on where and
how one lives, and Altruism, which measures a concern for assisting others. Although
older trainees were found to have less computer experience than younger trainees did,

"2496","10092/806",,,"Jeffery, William Edgar",,,,,,,,"1995",,,"This thesis closely studies the career of James Jeffery as a
teacher, teacher politician and newspaper columnist from the earliest
days of the national system of primary education (1879) through to his
retirement in 1914, and beyond. It outlines his relationship with his
school committees and the inspectorate, showing him to have been an
innovative, articulate teacher, actively involved in the educational
controversies of that era, but ultimately much less successful
professionally than his early promise suggested he might have been.
Recruited newly certificated from Victoria along with others who
came to occupy significant positions in the Otago Education Board's
schools, he was promoted early (1886) to the headmastership of a
suburban Dunedin school. An inveterate proselytizer, self-educated
through omnivorous and life-long reading, he aimed at preparing
pupils for citizenship by having them think for themselves and form
their own conclusions. He advocated and practised studying the world
beyond the classroom - the events of the day, their background and the
world of nature. As an extension of these aims he conducted two longrunning
weekly newspaper columns which dealt with those worlds, and
which consequently provide an insight into the interests and opinions
of Victorian and Edwardian New Zealand.
Throughout he sustained an active role in teacher affairs, being
twice president of the Educational Institute of Otago, and of the New
Zealand Educational Institute 1904-1905. He was an important and
combative figure in many contemporary Otago educational
controversies, and nationally in the battle to gain a superannuation
scheme for teachers.
This combativeness, coupled with his inability or unwillingness
to contain his teaching within the confines of inspectorially approved
systems and syllabuses were factors contributing to his failure to be
promoted and to his early retirement, aged 56, in 1914.
Wartime secretaryship of the Otago institute, technical college
teaching, and patriotic work followed, and finally a brief foray into
local politics as a city councillor.",,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/2155",,,,"en",,,,,"University of Canterbury.

"2792","10092/806",,,,,"Slade, George Horton",,,,,,"1998",,,"In its report to the Government of the day, the Taskforce to Review
Education Administration in New Zealand (The Picot Committee) made a
number of proposals for administrative reform of the primary and
secondary school system. It made the following claims as to the benefits
which would flow from the adoption of its recommendations:
1. Parents, students, teachers and administration support staff would
receive overall educational and social benefits.
2. Local institutions would have discretion over spending 94.5% of a
budget of $1,937.7 million.
3. Central organisations would have discretion over the remaining 5.5%
of expenditure.
4. Efficiency gains of $93 million would be returned to local institutions
for educational use.
This study assesses whether these benefits did in fact accrue by looking at the
schools in one electorate, the old Lyttelton Electorate. It looks in particular
at their financial statements. It asks whether schools in fact did have greater
control over their finances, specifically whether the greater discretionary
spending which was supposed to flow from decentralisation in fact occurred.
The years 1993 and 1994 were selected so as to provide a snapshot of schools'
financial situation four years after the Tomorrow's Schools reforms took
place. It appears that, in the period in question, census data indicative of
socio-economic status of the parents of children in the schools, when linked
with schools' accounts, show that the Tomorrow's Schools reforms created
less discretionary income for schools at the lower end of the socio-economic
spectrum than the reform promises implied and that the greater degree of such income at the higher end of the spectrum was created not by the
reforms but by the parents' capacity to generate income additional to
government grants.",,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/2425",,,,"en",,,,,"University of Canterbury.

"2734","10092/806",,,"Nuttall, Jocelyn Grace",,,,,,,,"1992",,,"The operation of childcare centres for profit has long been a contentious issue
in early childhood circles. Research in New Zealand and overseas has shown
that staff in non-profit centres, compared to those in private centres, tend to
receive higher average wages, have lower rates of staff turnover, receive more
benefits, are more likely to have paid breaks and non-contact time, are more
likely to view their work as a career, express greater job satisfaction and
commitment, are better trained in early childhood care and education and are
more experienced in childcare.
The present study surveyed 32 staff in five Christchurch childcare centres; two
of the centres were privately owned. Staff were asked about qualifications,
work history, their motivations for working in childcare, the most and least
favourable aspects of their work, differences between their current centre and
other centres they had worked in and how they saw their future in childcare and
the future of childcare in New Zealand.
In addition, four childcare workers were interviewed in depth; three of them
were working in privately owned centres. The interviews mainly focused on
the women's relationships with their employer(s), including the pleasures and
difficulties of their work situations.
Workers in privately owned centres were found to be generally experiencing
poorer conditions than their colleagues in non-profit centres and several gave
accounts of harassment by their employer, including direct threats and
intimidation.
The results of these surveys and interviews are considered in the light of the
historical context for childcare in Aotearoa/New Zealand, including important
social trends such as the feminist resurgence of the 1970s. Significant theories
which have impacted on social attitudes to women and childcare are also
described and their relevance to the trends indicated by the present study is
outlined.
The study argues that, despite significant advances in the unionisation and
'professionalisation' of childcare workers in recent times, women who work in
this field are still overwhelmingly motivated by the intrinsic rewards of their
work. This trend, it is argued, stems from the persistence of the 'cult of
mothering' which developed in western capitalist societies in the late 1800s,
which has led to the overwhelming 'feminisation' of childcare work.
The study concludes by briefly considering the unresolved questions raised by
the study, and the possibilities for change in the way society values the work of
caring for and educating young children as proposed by socialist feminist
analyses.",,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/2355",,,,"en",,,,,"University of Canterbury.

…But we’re still fucking peasants as far as I can see.
A working-class hero is something to be…”
(Song sung by Marianne Faithfull, 1990).
The quote above illustrates the conflict highlighted by this study between workingclass
struggle (and possible middle-class exploitation) and working-class hopes and
aspirations for a middle-class future. It also reflects the uncomfortable sense of being
“between two worlds” and “belonging nowhere” that is described by the mature,
working-class women university students in my study. This feeling of being not quite
one thing or another is expressed in Lucey, Melody and Walkerdine’s (2002) phrase
“uneasy hybrids”. It encapsulates the struggles, conflicts and successes faced by the
four women in my study as they attempted to juggle family, study and work
commitments, dealt with relationship break-ups, unexpected academic successes, and
learned how to adapt to a middle-class environment. The project involved five case
studies (although in the end only four were fully used) using a semi-structured
interview and additional focus group discussion approach. My participants were four
mature working-class women who were currently studying at a New Zealand
University. Little research has been done on this demographic, particularly in New
Zealand, despite interest generated by the 1980s British film Educating Rita. I
compared my findings, in which the key themes were alienation, overwhelming
struggle, strategising, and unexpected advantages and successes, with the issues raised
in the film. There were some similarities in terms of relationship-break-down and not
belonging being part of upward social mobility. However, it appeared the reality of
changing class is less tidy, speedy and comfortable than Rita’s filmic ending, where
she successfully incorporated her original working-class and new middle-class
identities. The literature appeared to support the experiences of my participants who,
despite their academic successes, talked about an on-going, disturbing sense of feeling
“like a fraud”.",,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/2361",,,,"en",,,,,"University of Canterbury.

"2650","10092/806",,,"Henderson, Christine Ann",,,,,,,,"2008",,,"The purpose of this study has been to provide a rich description of the role of the literacy leader in two primary schools. Through this study I was seeking to identify what the role of the literacy leader is and how this role is enacted. The role has been described from the perspectives of the literacy leader, a principal and five members of two school’s teaching staff. The desire to better understand the role of the literacy leader is important to those in the role and those they interact with. This is particularly so for those in my position as a professional developer, working alongside both a school and its literacy leader as they undertake in-depth literacy professional development.

Literacy leaders have assumed greater responsibilities within schools since the 1999 Literacy Taskforce report which suggested a range of initiatives to better support literacy learners in New Zealand. Since this report there has been a governmental priority on literacy as a foundation learning area. Interest in literacy success for all stems from both international and national assessment knowledge. This information highlights the strength of New Zealand students in literacy but also identifies a group of students who do not perform well and continue to underachieve in literacy into adulthood. This underachievement limits the opportunities they have as adults for employment and participation in society. 

There has been no formalised role description for literacy leaders or how they might enact this role. The purpose of this study therefore has been to identify the role and how it is enacted. The literacy leader role has been analysed from multiple perspectives. Participant observation and in-depth interviewing have provided a rich picture of the role and how it is enacted. It is from these insights that some clarity has been gained about the characteristics of the role, how it is interpreted by the participants and then enacted by the two leaders. The findings indicate the role identified by those participating in this study and the reality of how it is enacted, are closely matched. 

The tasks of a literacy leader are complex and their dual role of classroom teacher and literacy leader adds to this complexity as they manage both positions simultaneously.  This study identified that being a literacy leader requires a central focus on improved student achievement. It requires literacy leaders to provide strong leadership in literacy professional development/learning. This study also suggests that literacy leaders are seen as learning partners during the in-depth literacy professional development/learning focus where all involved are learners. The final role they play is in supporting the development of a collaborative professional learning community where all of the learning occurs.

It raises issues and questions for those who interact with the literacy leader both within the school and those outside the school in how they can support them in this role. It also surfaces the need for schools and professional developers to address how the structures they are operating within can be reorganised to afford the time needed to be effective in this role.  Finally when schools, advisers and Ministry of Education enter into a partnership of learning openly demonstrating that each will learn from the other, then capacity is built across all levels of the education system in meeting the goals of improved student outcomes.",,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/2261",,,,"en",,,,,"University of Canterbury.

"2733","10092/806",,,"Mizusawa, Risa",,,,,,,,"2003",,,"Sleep problems are frequently reported in children and studies indicate that
approximately 15 to 30% of children experience some form of sleep difficulty (Partinen &
Hublin, 2000; Richman, 1981; Zuckerman, Stevenson, & Bailey, 1987). Children's sleep
problems often impact on family members, in particular parents, causing a considerable
amount of stress and frustration. Difficulties with sleep are a common problem for typically
developing children; however, research indicates that the incidence of sleep problems is even
higher in the disabilities population (Didden, Korzillius, van Aperlo, Overloop, & de Vries,
2002; Espie & Tweedie, 1991; Richdale, Francis, Gavidia-Payne, & Cotton, 2000; Saxby &
Morgan, 1983). This has implications for families already under considerable amounts of
stress and pressure of having a child with a disability.
The present study aimed to treat persistent sleep problems in children with disabilities
using family behavioural intervention methods. A range of behavioural strategies was utilised
to reduce sleep problems such as bed refusal, sleep onset delay, night waking, co-sleeping,
and nightmares. Techniques such as a positive bedtime routine, reward systems, the parental
presence programme, standard and modified extinction were used. In one case, a short-term
decremental dose of a mild sedative (trimeprazine tartrate) was used in the initial stages of
implementing a behavioural intervention to reduce child and parent distress. A ""fear busting
and monster taming"" programme (White, 1985) was employed in conjunction with other
behavioural techniques to reduce the occurrence of nightmares in another child. The results
indicate that behavioural family interventions are effective in treating sleep problems in
children with disabilities. The majority of the sleep behaviours targeted for intervention were
eliminated or reduced to low levels of occurrence with 9 out of 11 target behaviours rated as
showing a substantial improvement. These positives changes were maintained at follow-up
with the exception of co-sleeping in Case Study Two. The social validity for the programmes
was high and caregivers reported satisfaction.",,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/2358",,,,"en",,,,,"University of Canterbury.

over a long period of time been promoting the benefits of this style of

Research based on the practical experience of educators using this approach
in the United States has indicated that;
- pupils/students tend to have a much more positive relationship
with teachers and are more interested in what they're learning; the
learning environment is considered safe and is learner-centred;
- the teacher / facilitators role is much more complex and requires
individuals to be able to move quickly between three different modes
of operating, giving direction, working co-operatively, and promoting
self direction in learners;
- experiential education is process oriented, is active and dynamic and
is based on a set of working principles.
The author has been involved over the last 4 years in developing an
experiential process for teacher education and this approach is the focus of
this study. The authors professional studies tutor group were given a
written survey while two co-tutors were interviewed to gather information
on their experience with this approach to teacher education.
The results of these surveys and interviews are considered in the light of
what characterises this experiential learning approach for teacher education
and explores how this differs from mainstream teaching and learning.
Because the literature on competency based teacher education and
experiential education is extremely limited the author has relied on
anecdotal evidence and experiential practice and has sought the views of
students and colleagues
The study promotes the principles of experiential education and puts
forward a case for the use of these practices as key tools for teaching. It also
highlights some of the problems faced by beginning teachers wanting to use
this approach when they start their teaching career. Experiential education
does conflict with many of the traditional practices that currently exist in
schools and tertiary institutions. This provides both challenges and obstacles

subject, English, as a site of ideological struggle. Its main premise is
that the struggle for 'ownership' of the subject is not a new one but has spanned
over a century. The argument endeavours to explore the idea that English is
unlike any other curriculum area in that it has, since the mid to late nineteenth
century, been regarded as a subject which has the potential to effect social transformation.
This issue of social transformation or 'social engineering' is at the
heart of much of the current criticism which surrounds English pedagogy. The
thesis shows how the framework for the arguments associated with social engineering
or social transformation can change depending upon certain social,
political and historical variables.
Because I am a feminist educator I have set my arguments against a background
of the personal locations which I believe have contributed to my interest in the
topic. Next, I place my ideas in a theoretical and political framework and look at
some of the current attitudes to English and its teachers. Following this I explore
the history of the subject in order to show how criticism and struggle are
typical of the subject's development. Finally, I examine contemporary approaches
to English teaching in order to demonstrate how and why the ideological
struggles which English has wrestled with have reached a new stage of

"2730","10092/806",,,,,"Christmas, Lois Helen",,,,,,"2009",,,"For over two decades, New Zealand primary schools teachers have been confused and stressed about assessment. Research carried out between 1998 and 2000 showed that teachers were not assessment literate. They didn’t have a good understanding of assessment theory. The political and educational purposes of assessment were in conflict with each other. Teachers were getting mixed messages about what they should be doing. The research found that teachers prioritised summative assessment and assessment for accountability although most teachers could see the considerable educational benefits of adopting formative assessment practices. They appeared to lack an understanding of how to translate such approaches successfully into classroom practice.
Since then most teachers have had opportunities to participate in extensive professional development which has emphasised the place of assessment. Little research has been carried out about how teachers’ assessment practices have changed as a result of this and very few studies include the perspective of students.
This study aimed to address this gap in research by establishing how four dynamic, committed teachers, in four different primary school settings, have changed their practices. It looked at how they currently view, understand and manage their assessment practices. The study included interviews with the school assessment leaders to establish the importance of the professional context in which the teachers work. Interview responses from the four teachers were compared with the responses of small groups of children from each teacher’s class to probe the related understandings and experiences of the students.
The findings indicated that the teachers had made considerable shifts in their beliefs about assessment in the last six years. They attributed the reason for these changes to be largely the result of professional development and changes in the culture of the schools in which they work. The results of this study showed that the case study teachers had clear understandings of assessment theory, they prioritised formative assessment, they had become proactive in determining what assessment practices were worthwhile and they had reconstructed their classroom cultures to involve students in the assessment process. Each teacher had developed her own personalised assessment programme that included her own unique mix of strategies. They had successfully married their extensive use of formative strategies with the assessment requirements of their schools. They had become more critical assessors who were not prepared to undertake any assessment that they deemed lacked purpose. The case study teachers were enthusiastic about the changes they had made and felt they were better teachers now because of these changes.
Similarly, the students who were interviewed for the study were also enthusiastic about and interested in their learning. They were able to talk about what assessment was for and able
to explain the ways in which the assessment processes in their classrooms were helping them learn.",,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/2362",,,,"en",,,,,"University of Canterbury.

education under Israeli military occupation. Confidential
interviews, currently available field research, and a
theoretical background form the basis from which the author
has constructed a picture of the nature of Palestinian
education under occupation.
The major topics covered include a political history of the
Arab-Israeli conflict including the adoption of the internal
colonialism theoretical perspective; an analysis of the
relationship between colonialism and education; the special
significance of education to the Palestinians and the
Israelis; an outline of Palestinian education under occupation
with particular reference to the post-1967 era; an account of
Palestinian life under military occupation which details the
inhumane treatment of Palestinian residents of the Occupied
Territories by the Israeli military authorities and settlers;
the revolutionary nature of the intifada; the targeting of
Palestinian university staff and students by Israelis for
especially harsh treatment; the massive Israeli crack-down on
Palestinian formal and informal education and the implications
for the Palestinians of the widespread and prolonged closures
of Palestinian schools and universities.
The author concludes that the Israeli authorities have
specifically targeted Palestinian education as an area which
they want to maintain close control over. The Israelis desire
the Palestinian population (particularly in the occupied Territories) to have only limited, token educational
opportunities, in order to keep them ignorant, and passive.
During the intifada then, the Israelis have severely disrupted
all levels of Palestinian education. Widespread school and
university closures have been used by the Israelis to
collectively punish the Palestinian community and hinder their
chances of developing a strong independent Palestinian

"2521","10092/806",,,"Crawshaw, Peter John Roberts",,,,,,,,"1993",,,"This project arose out of a desire to see if computers were starting to fulfil their
potential in engaging higher order thinking skills in pupil users. The.choice of
educational software to evaluate was prompted by the availability of a wide
ranging series of teacher-written, easily-available HyperCard-based
courseware collectively called ""HyperEd NZ"" for the Apple Macintosh computer.
These titles have been acclaimed overseas, and there are equivalent
HyperCard-like platforms being developed for other computer families.
To establish which titles of this series were being used in New Zealand schools
in 1992, and to what extent their users thought they were achieving worthwhile
learning outcomes a teacher attitude questionnaire was sent out to a number of
schools with Macintosh machines.
It was seen that 20 titles of the 28 had been used in at least one class. One title,
""School Certificate Mathematics"" was reported on by seven classes, all to useful
effect.
Other responses showed that in some cases teacher directed activities through
specific tasksheets improved the possibility of positive learning outcomes. A
significant number of titles involved the pupils in elements of simulation,
transferring of knowledge to other work and other higher order thinking skills. In
a few cases less successful learning outcomes could be explained by
unfamiliarity with the then-new computer environment or inadequate direction
from teachers.
Overall, however, the HyperEd series was seen to be well-designed and useful
courseware, providing many useful examples of interesting and worthwhile
supplements or alternatives to other learning experiences.
The titles are good examples of hypertext-based courseware.
This feeling was reinforced by pupil attitude questionnaires and a limited case
study carried out using ""Hype-Poet"" with two 6th Fom Certificate English classes
using the pre-test and post-test model.
Some of the doubts expressed by teachers regarding the use of HyperCardbased
software were allayed by the study. For instance, the slow response to
buttons noted by many reviewers was not seen as a problem by most pupils,
even on the larger titles such as 'Hyperf-oet"". This was especially so if they
were paired and using a suitable task-sheet.
Instructions were sometimes unclear, but never enough to deter learning. The
software was generally 'well-behaved' in the hands of pupils and navigation
tools were sufficient and suitable. Most pupils were in pairs or greater numbers
and in keeping with earlier research the pairs and trios seemed to achieve
higher learning outcomes than individuals.
Pupils tended to see the courseware as better tha.n an equivalent textbook, .
while teachers were more circumspect in this comparison. Some gender
differences were found in the copmpletion of tasks and pupils' opinions of the
programme. Females tended to complete the tasks set more often and males
were more inclined to be critical of the programme look and feel.
Both teachers and pupils found the courseware highly motivational - many
mentioning the novelty or innovative factors.",,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/2170",,,,"en",,,,,"University of Canterbury.

The class situation of academic staff is defined according to two indices: market situation (including salary levels, promotion prospects and job security) and work situation (including issues of autonomy and collegiality). Factors which supported the privileged class situation of academics, as well as historical details about how academics have won organisational advantages are also discussed. The evidence shows that the class situation of academics has clearly deteriorated. Salaries have dropped in absolute terms and in relation to average New Zealand incomes. Promotion prospects also appear to have deteriorated, and tenure or job security appears to be threatened. Since 1982, a secondary labour market of part-time, untenured teaching assistants expanded disproportionately. Organisational advantages have also been eroded. In the late 1980s and ear1y 1990s, the State appears to be undermining the control over university life gained by the academic profession in the 1960s and 1970s. This situation, and recent evidence that points to a tighter relationship between the universities and the market in the near future, suggests that the academic profession could lose control over what is taught and researched in the universities. Despite these trends, the academic profession still retains significant economic and organisational advantages. This is born out in a series of in-depth interviews of academic staff at the University of Canterbury where there appears to be general satisfaction with economic and organisational features of work (other N.Z. universities may be different). The prevention of further erosion of conditions appears to be the main rationale for the widespread support of unionism at this university. Other factors which may limit the deterioration of the class situation of professionals are discussed in the final chapter.",,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/2424",,,,"en",,,,,"University of Canterbury.

towards road safety measures, to driving, to traffic enforcement
and personnel as well as the general involvement of male students
in the driving of motor vehicles, motor vehicle ownership, accidents
and self-reports of actual behaviour on the roads as pedestrians,
cyclists and motorists.
A random sample of 1,184 male secondary school students at all
grade and ability levels was drawn from secondary schools in North
Island areas of New Zealand which have a high population of Maoris
and Polynesians. Questionnaires for licensed drivers, unlicensed
drivers, non-drivers and youths under-fifteen years were administered
to all male youths and a Semantic Differential Attitude Scale was
administered to male students of or over fifteen years only. The
results were analyzed by the ethnic groups Maori, Pakeha and Polynesian
and also, where applicable, by driver groups including the under-fifteens
where appropriate. A factor analysis of the Semantic Differential
Attitude Scale scores were carried out for drivers.
In respect to attitudes the results suggest that regardless
of ethnic affiliation or driver group, youths in general are essentially
conventional and conformist. And regardless of ethnic affiliation,
students are very much involved with the driving of motor cars both before and after the minimum licensing age and that the motor cycle
is not as popular, either owned or driven, as one might expect. However,
whilst ethnic groups appear more alike than different in most respects,
considerable differences exist between licensed and unlicensed drivers
on measures of exposure and between drivers and cyclists in their
compliance with intersection laws.
In respect to accidents, though the results are tentative for
reasons discussed, it seems that unlicensed drivers may contribute to
young driver accident statistics.",,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/2485",,,,"en",,,,,"University of Canterbury.

research into the teaching of spelling. In New Zealand, the teaching of spelling is embedded
in the whole-language classroom programme. Evidence suggests that the level of
achievement in spelling in children's writing is of current concern (Flockton & Crooks,
1999).
The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of the addition of daily ten to fifteen
minute SRA Spelling Mastery lessons had on the spelling of six-year-old children, in
their daily process writing. In addition, the extent of generalisation of both the phonological
skills and the specific spellings of high frequency irregular words taught to the children's
writing were analysed.
A single-case, combined multiple-baseline and reversal design was used to compare
differences in spelling performance during baseline conditions and treatment (SRA Spelling
Mastery) conditions. During baseline, the children continued participating in the whole language
classroom programme. In the treatment phase, the children participated in a daily
SRA Spelling Mastery lesson as an addition to the baseline procedures.
Seven, six-year-old Year Two children, from a regular classroom, four boys and
three girls who met the criteria for teaching at SRA Spelling Mastery Level A (based on the
SRA Spelling Mastery Level A Placement Test) and who had no identified difficulties or
special needs nor were receiving programmes additional to the classroom programme,
participated in the study. Gentry's (1981, 1982) stages were used to determine the children's
spelling development. The results showed that the children's phonetic spelling accuracy increased during
SRA Spelling Mastery, indicating a treatment effect; however, minimal change occurred in
the level of orthographic spelling accuracy. When the number of different words written
without a prompt, and ortho graphic and phonetic spelling accuracy were compared, a
possible treatment effect occurred. The high frequency irregular words taught generalised to
the children's writing. There was a possible gender effect during the SRA Spelling Mastery
conditions favouring girls. The children rated SRA Spelling Mastery as more preferred than
process writing.",,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/2478",,,,"en",,,,,"University of Canterbury.

"2899","10092/806",,,"Pahud, Marie-Thérèse",,,,,,,,"2008",,,"A significant proportion of worldwide research concerning adult refugees has investigated
clinical perspectives and emphasised the impact of pre and post-migration experiences as key
factors affecting their mental health status. Nevertheless, a clear understanding of their mental
health problems and psychiatric morbidity is difficult to obtain due to major prevalence
variations and discrepancies between studies. Further, recent studies in New Zealand have
underlined the limitation of health providers' abilities to meet refugees' mental health needs.
On the other hand, despite the acknowledgment of refugees' endurance abilities to overcome
traumatic events during both their pre-migration flight and in their first asylum countries,
relatively less is known about their capacities to show positive adaptation to life's tasks in the
course of resettlement in a final host country and how this impacts on preventing mental
health problems. The current study, therefore, was undertaken to develop a theoretical
understanding to describe and explain adult refugees' coping processes in overcoming
resettlement difficulties and adjusting to life in New Zealand. This was achieved by using the
grounded theory methodology where qualitative data were collected from twenty-six former
refugees coming from war torn countries namely Afghanistan, Burma (Myanmar), Ethiopia,
Kurdistan region and Somalia who are now living in Christchurch and Nelson.
Participants described the basic social process of obtaining a social position as being the main
goal which motivated them to develop their coping skills and behaviour. They explained that
this was underpinned by the inter-relationship of their personal resources and gradual personal
achievements which were influenced by encouraging external support from resettlement
services providers and ""caring"" New Zealanders. Data collected during this study suggest that
this dynamic process, in which personality and environmental factors interacted in a
reciprocal and transactional relationship, appeared to be the condition sine qua non to
negotiate and manage resettlement challenges. Indeed, participants frequently emphasised that
if this interaction was not activated they faced greater difficulties in coming to terms with
their new environment and in their adjustment to life in New Zealand, thus leading potentially
to adverse mental health outcomes. Additionally, quantitative socio-economic data were
collected so as to describe participants' characteristics. The study’s findings underline the complexity of adult refugees’ coping processes as well as
some of the institutional constraints hindering their adaptation progress which can result in
mental distress. These issues require responses which are beyond the health sector on its own.
The implications of supporting the development of personal abilities so as to guide pragmatic
support and encourage multisectoral collaboration are outlined and discussed. Areas for
further research are highlighted as well as strategic issues which need to be addressed for
improving the current situation of refugees resettled in New Zealand.",,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/2513",,,,"en",,,,,"University of Canterbury.

Zealand's social fabric, this thesis explores the complex and contradictory
relationship between a group of indigenous students and a mainstream
institution of higher learning. Presented as 'stories within stories' it tells the
stories of eleven Maori students' experiences at the University of Canterbury
between 1996 and 1998. In doing so it tells of the struggles they faced and the
strategies they employed to realise their dreams in an institution that did not
reflect who they were. This thesis then, despite the diverse ways in which they
grew up Maori, is a victory narrative of the students' struggles to maintain their
own sense of being Maori in a mono-cultural institution.
The topic arose out of my own experience of being a Maori student in a
mainstream university and my endeavors to make sense of our institutional
invisibility on campus and the silencing of our voices. Indeed, the questions that
I was left asking spurred me on to become a research student. Therefore, this
thesis is as much about my journey to becoming a kaupapa Maori researcher as it
is about the journeys of the students into and within the University of
Canterbury. Positioned outside of the prevailing scientific traditions, the
kaupapa Maori phenomenological based study I conducted took for granted
Maori cultural practices, values and aspirations. I drew on traditional ways of
knowing and being, as well as contemporary narratives to understand the lived
realities of the students.
When I began to write my thesis it became clear that an orthodox account of
Maori students' experiences was inconsistent with the way I had conducted the
research, and the values and practices that underpinned it. I began to rewrite my
thesis, and in the process wrote back to the academy in a way that better
reflected not only who I am but also the Maori community within which the
research was conducted.

"3090","10092/806",,,"Byres, Jan",,,,,,,,"2006",,,"This dissertation explores the positioning, construction and assessment of visual art and
the influences on these. The perspectives of nine primary teachers were investigated
through informal interviews.
The fields of visual art, visual art education, assessment and curriculum were analysed to
provide the background and context for the study. This analysis was ongoing and
informed the research questions and the research processes. All these fields are complex
with underlying tensions. Major changes in educational administration, assessment and
central curricula in New Zealand since 1990 were relevant to the study.
The research question was 'How is primary visual art positioned, constructed and
assessed at the operational level and what are some of the influences on these?' A
qualitative design was selected in order to find out teachers' views. A grounded theory
approach was used in which key themes emerged from the data. Nine teachers from nine
different primary schools were selected through purposive sampling for a range of
characteristics including teaching experience, age of class, school characteristics and
particularly interest in visual art. Content analysis was also used to investigate The Arts
in the New Zealand Curriculum. Processes of analysis and interpretation were ongoing
with critical reflection, discussion and reading ofthe literature throughout. The final
dissertation is a 'bricolage' of the participants' stories, voices from the literature and my
story. Social constructionism was selected as the overarching theory that gave the study
coherence.
The initial finding that influenced the direction and framing of the study was that these
teachers and schools actively constructed curricula. They did not passively receive and
deliver a given central curriculum. Woven through the findings chapters were key
themes of complexity and context. Differences and similarities between the schools and
the teachers illuminated the significance of context. Constructed visual art curricula were
a complex interaction of influences and some significant tensions emerged including the tension between summative and formative assessment. The relationship between
assessment and curricula was complex.
The operational visual arts curricula of the teachers in this study were constructed as
making and doing artworks using a range of media and skills, mostly in isolation from
social, cultural or historical contexts. These teachers' visual art was non-controversial
and predominantly PakehalEurocentric. The positioning of visual art within wider
operational curricula varied between the teachers and the schools. In some of the schools
visual art was positioned at the margins of the operational curricula. In all of the schools
literacy and numeracy were prioritised. This was hegemonic and questions were not
asked about their construction or what their priority meant for other subjects. The
increasingly overcrowded curricula of separate subjects, requirements for summative
assessment, constant time pressures and teachers' workload were very significant issues ..
Breadth of curriculum coverage was occurring at the expense of depth.
The Arts in the New Zealand Curriculum was only one influence on the construction of
operational visual arts curricula. The teachers used it selectively if at all. Teachers'
personal experiences were also relevant. An unexpected finding was the significant role
and power of the schools through long-term overviews and curriculum programmes,
assessment requirements, timetables and organisational structures. In this study there
was almost no evidence of political and ideological influences in teachers' discourses
despite the dominance ofthese in the New Zealand literature.
Assessment was dominated by discourses and practices of summative assessment, which
is consistent with the literature. All of the teachers told of collecting much more
assessment data than was needed for reporting to school managers or parents and
caregivers. Assumptions were made about the meaningfulness of the information
collected and assessment of creativity and processes in visual art was problematic.
The teachers considered much of the assessment they had to do had no purpose, added to
their workloads and did not benefit children. Despite the importance placed on formative
assessment in the literature and the stated commitment to developing formative assessment in the Ministry of Education's assessment strategy, it was often not
understood or valued.
I asked why summative assessment continued to be so dominant. Some possibilities
included the hegemonies of accepted discourses and practices, the underlying but often
unstated importance of the accountability function supported by the Education Review
Office (ERO), the Ministry of Education and the political ideology of the New Right, and
school managers and leaders who imposed the requirements but did not understand
assessment.
The dissertation concludes by considering the implications of the findings for visual art
as a subject, for school managers and for teacher agency in primary schools. The future
of visual art as a subject seems uncertain in an overcrowded curriculum of separate
subjects in which literacy and numeracy are prioritised. Its positioning within operational
curricula, whether at the margins or not, depended on a complex interaction of influences.
Principals and other school managers need to understand the purpose, rationale and
impacts of their decisions on teachers and operational curricula. Teacher agency is
important for teacher efficacy, morale and interest, and in order to interrogate change.
Operational visual art curricula assessment and teacher agency were contextual and very
complex. Complexities and tensions were evident at all levels.
This study contributes to understandings about primary visual art education, primary
teachers' issues and experiences, and the construction of operational curricula in primary
schools.",,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/2701",,,,"en",,,,,"University of Canterbury.

The proj ect examined how the students used concept mapping as part of the cooperative
inquiry process. Higher order (metacognitive) leaming outcomes ofthis integration were
analysed. Implications and recommendations for future teaching and leaming were also
identified.
Findings demonstrated that while concept mapping, the students used the concept map as

adjustment of information links and organisation in the evolving concept maps.
One student demonstrated an aware level of metacognitive thinking during the concept
mapping process. Three of the students demonstrated an aware level of as a result of
questioning during post-unit interviews.
The case study group performed as a cooperative leaming group throughout the inquiry.
They demonstrated commitment to each other and to the group's success. It is probable
that well developed cooperative skills had a positive impact on the cooperative concept
mapping process and the role of the concept map as a Mindtool for the group.
In this study the classroom teacher demonstrated trust in and had high expectations for
the behaviour and learning of the students in the case study group. These students
increasingly managed their own time and the necessary resources for completing the
inquiry. They were often given choices about when and where to work and often worked

However there is a need for further research to reveal to what extent teachers of
mathematics and other subjects are actually making use of computers. This is because
since the release of the National Strategy no nationwide studies, specifically related to
mathematics, have been carried out to investigate the achievement of its goals in the
field of secondary mathematics teaching. Now, three years later, this present research
attempts to fill that gap, and to provide government, educators, and all concerned people
with deeper insight into current practice and application of computer use in the daily
teaching of secondary mathematics. This research aims to contribute towards a solid
foundation for further research and future planning.
This research attempts to answer these questions:
- To what extent and for what purposes are computers being used in secondary
mathematics teaching?
- How do teachers envision the use of computers in the classroom teachinglearning
process?
This research explores consistency between computer usage and Ministry goals as stated
in MiNZC and other official statements on Information and Communication
Technologies in teaching and learning.
This research reveals that actual use of computers in classroom processes for the
teaching and learning of mathematics remains small, comprising less than 1% of actual
teaching time. Their use tends to be devoted to extending or practising pre-taught
material, and serves mostly the statistics strand within the curriculum. Students seem to
have unequal opportunities for use of computers. Junior students' teachers are, in
general, more likely to use computers than senior students' teachers. The higher thinking
mathematical process skills such as reasoning, exploring and discovering are unlikely to
playa vital role in the use of computers. Results also indicate that a large majority of
teachers have positive attitudes and perceive a constructive role for computers in the
teaching of classroom mathematics. However, they remain cautious and are mindful of
barriers to computer usage such as hardware availability, accessibility, software
suitability, and professional training.
The Ministry of Education hopes to achieve several goals from its computer initiatives.
The most important of these is to provide opportunities for students to gain confidence
and become competent users of computers in mathematical contexts to prepare them for
a technology permeated future. On present evidence this goal is not currently being
achieved in many classrooms.
In summary, this research indicates that the use of computers in classroom teaching of
mathematics is not fully meeting the governments' goals. To clarify and overcome
obstacles, and to align classroom practice in using computers to teach mathematics with
government goals, still requires further research, debate, cooperation, and determination.",,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/2767",,,,"en",,,,,"University of Canterbury.

telecommunication technology has been described as increasing the flexibility and the
capacity of the tertiary institutions to meet student needs more precisely and conveniently.
Capper, Fitzgerald, Weldon & Wilson (2000) believe this will lead to a ""significant
change over the next 20 years resulting in complete reconstruction of the notion of what a
'teacher' is"" (p.l0). Many of the decisions in introducing a new course are made in the
interests of students or the educational institution but it is the teachers who play the
critical role in implementing the changes and the success or failure often rests upon what
they think and do. This research project was undertaken to look at the perspectives of a
group of teachers as they struggled to understand and negotiate their part in implementing
a new strategy for delivering course content.
The planned introduction of a distance course at the college of education where I am
employed provided an opportunity for investigation. A phenomenological model was
used, as the intention was to find out about the participants' feelings, behaviours, or
attitudes (the insider's view). A research paradigm that enabled the discovery of interrelationships
between people was therefore necessary. A case study using individual semistructured
interviews was used to gather the initial data and find emerging themes. The
data was triangulated through written review and a group interview.
This research identified one of the fundamental concerns of teachers, and perhaps the
biggest barrier to introducing change, as the teacher's present workload. Without time and
space to learn about the technologies and to reflect on implications for pedagogy, teachers
will be unable to deal with the complexities of change. Educational institutions
introducing major changes need to remember that it is the teachers who will be
responsible for implementing the changes.",,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/2770",,,,"en",,,,,"University of Canterbury.

more content with utilizing items that were readily available in the kindergarten, and
made items that were safe, which I interpreted as, objects they knew the teachers
would like. Findings indicate that boys can be helped to realize ways of being

levels of personal ICT skills and confidence on a comparable level to those who had
completed three years of ICT PD. Differences in the cohorts were apparent in the amount of
time teachers attempted to integrate ICT into their programmes for student's use. It appears
that:

"3203","10092/806",,,"O'Sullivan, Monique",,,,,,,,"2006",,,"Recently New Zealand schools have faced an ongoing climate of
Education Reviews with many schools being restructured or closed as a
result. For schools faced with the reality of possible closure, it is
imperative that they explore other alternatives to maintain choice for the
local community which they serve. One such alternative has been to
develop a merger between two or more schools where the schools involved
merge onto one central site, often establishing a new school identity at the
same time.
This research project explores a case study of a merger between a large
urban primary school and a small two teacher rural primary school in New
Zealand, who took the concept of a merger between two schools, but
instead adapted the process where they operated under one name and one
shared Board of Trustees, but continued to operate from the two original
school sites with classes coming together for specific school wide events.
This study explores the leadership and management challenges that the
school leaders faced as they established their merger, and addresses four
key areas as a result - how to create a model and develop a vision for the
merger, staffing considerations, issues surrounding communication
systems, and the lack of support structures which is a dominant factor and
one that is also explored in relation to the other key challenges. The
findings are also related to current educational issues in regard to the leadership of small schools in New Zealand and the education review
process.
The issues and challenges raised in this research paper are intended to
provide information which address how such a merger impacts on school
management and leadership. As it appears that no similar studies have
been undertaken in New Zealand in this particular setting, it will be of
particular relevance for schools facing education reviews or for schools

many of their services. This qualitative case study focuses on the induction and
training of the Refuge volunteer advocates in one particular Refuge in Christchurch in
1998 - 1999. It examines the tensions inherent in a pedagogy of learning from
experience, which operates in a wider context of state funding and state surveillance
of the quality of services.
Within the Refuge, the notions of 'experience' and 'learning' were not neutral or
value free. What counted as learning within the Refuge context was not generalised
knowledge, but an ability to engage in certain practices and talk about these practices
in particular ways. Throughout their training volunteer advocates were learning not
just how to support women and children escaping violence in their homes, but how to
manage their identities as learners and workers within the institutional regimes of the
Refuge. The volunteer advocates had to learn to demonstrate reflexivity, and be
'honest,' but they also learnt to manage that honesty. They were learning about the
Refuge work, what 'experience' was valuable, and how to demonstrate that they were
learning in this particular environment by demonstrating a capacity for self reflective
talk about those experiences. In this respect they had to engage in 'experiential
learning' by overtly reconstructing their own actions, interactions and feelings.",,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/2887",,,,"en",,,,,"University of Canterbury.

hypothesise on students' invisible and visible behaviours in conjunction with their actions.
To examine the coping/managing strategies of learning, I worked with nine Senior Samoan
students at a state suburban high school in New Zealand over a period of over a year
following individuals and groups. Intensive observations of the student sample was
complemented and supplemented by fa'afaletui fonos (forums) and informal discussions with
parents, teachers and students' peers and cohorts. Data was analysed during the data
collection process, which covered a period of over four years. During this time, it became
necessary to broaden not only my understanding of what others were doing, but also
substantially to modify my own approach.
The cultural conflict faced by Samoan students in their learning has been defined as
""wavering"" or more specifically, ""content wavering"" which relates to students' interaction
with the content of the curriculum, and ""feelings wavering"" which relates to socio-cultural
and psychological factors. Samoan students search to overcome both forms of wavering by
way of: pacifying in apprenticeship; crafting in guided participation; and ascertaining in
participatory appropriation. The ways in which they cope reveal a process of ""nurturing
coolness and dignity"", a process that those involved in education need to be aware of and
utilise to help Samoans and/or Pasifika students to succeed in the New Zealand education
system, particularly in classroom learning.",,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/2886",,,,"en",,,,,"University of Canterbury.

All teachers are teachers of academic language, and while no child is born with school language as a first language, for some students the match between home and school is more closely aligned than for other students. Teachers are expected to be culturally responsive, ensuring the languages and culture of students is visible in the classroom environment and the classroom curriculum. 

Despite the increasing knowledge about the specific strategies and approaches that will most effectively support CLD students in classrooms, the teaching of CLD students within mainstream contexts remains far from ideal. Teachers need support to access the principles of effective teaching of CLD learners that are available, and importantly to transfer the knowledge into classroom practice.

Professional development and learning is linked to improved teacher practice and student learning outcomes. When teachers have opportunities to be engaged in successful elements of in-depth professional learning such as in-class modelling, observation and feedback, and co-construction of teaching and planning they are able to demonstrate improved pedagogical content knowledge. Their beliefs may also need to be challenged.

The study was conducted in two schools in a large city in New Zealand where I am employed as an ESOL and literacy adviser.  Using an action research method I was able to examine how a professional development and learning process shaped my own knowledge and practice as well as teacher knowledge and practice. 

The study fills a research space to gain insights into the effective professional learning processes that impact on teacher strategies and approaches with their CLD learners A central tenet of this research is that teachers can improve their practice of teaching CLD students and they can specifically learn strategies and approaches that are considered effective for them.",,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/2682",,,,"en",,,,,"University of Canterbury.

The research provided evidence that students gave a lot of thought to specific incidents

critical thinking and critical action are evident in the research. Students also reported
thinking about their sport involvement both from a participation point of view and also
about the nature of their involvement, for example helping others, in out of school

Ministry of Education regional office over the period 1989-1996. An institutional
analysis within a state theoretical framework is used to explore the shift from one logic
of administrative action - Old Public Administration - to another - namely New Public
Management. To be 'successful', a logic of administrative action has to ensure
congruence between the apparatus of the state and the state's political project - in this
case, neo-liberalism. Secondly, a logic of administrative action must also align actors
within the state so that the 'right things' are done in the 'right way'. The Management
Centre provides a case study revealing the uneven success in achieving both kinds of
alignment. The relative strength and weaknesses of the logics of Old Public
Administration and New Public Management and the eventual compromise in the form
of the latter are explained by factors at the micro-level of the Management Centre, the
meso-level of the public sector and the macro-level of the governance role of the state in
education. It is suggested here that a compromise in the form of New Public
Management was inevitable because of the nature of the state's governance role in
education and because of the institutional characteristics of the shift to New Public
Management. Through unpacking the 'black box' of the state this thesis explains how
the neo-liberal objectives of the state were realised unevenly within parts of the state
apparatus over the 1989-1996 period.",,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/2883",,,,"en",,,,,"University of Canterbury.

children's special needs, based on the social constructionism ideology and to capture the
essence of their experiences living in Christchurch, New Zealand. These experiences
have been presented with a narrative inquiry approach. The researcher draws on personal
and social interactions throughout the research in learning about this topic. Seven
Chinese families with children with special needs were recruited, four through word of
mouth and three through a special school. Mothers of these seven families were
interviewed using open-ended questions.
The open ended research plan led to four phases in this study. The first phase involved
carrying out a brief survey among practitioners in Christchurch to understand the
contemporary issues regarding working with Chinese families with children with special
needs. The second phase included investigation of the connotation of special needs in
Mandarin terms. The third phase consisted of recruitment and interviews with the first
four families, and then in the final phase, with another three families.
Themes emerged from the data included: Parenting practices, the role relationships within
the family unit, the perceived important skills for the child, parental investments, familial
support, social support and professional support. These themes were incorporated into
two parts: The primacy of the family unit, and Support.
The centrality of parenthood in Chinese society in terms of the cyclic enactment of
acceptance, and responsibility was highlighted. With one exception, the parents in this
study reported engaging in different activities including learning about the child's
disorder, carrying out intervention at home and adjusting the family lifestyle to the
child's needs. The parental investment indicated parental resilience in facing the child's

"3322","10092/806",,,"Robertson, Prudence Jane",,,,,,,,"2003",,,"The interweaving of two strands of inquiry forms the backbone of this thesis. In the first
strand (the 'what' of the thesis) I explore the qualitatively different ways in which
academic staff at the University of Canterbury, New Zealand experience the relation
between research and teaching and investigate the pedagogical implications of this
variation. In the second strand (the 'how' of the thesis) I focus on the process of coming
to know and to talk within the field of higher education. Here I chart my journey as a
learner through the writing of the thesis. The two strands are linked through their mutual
focus on learning, inquiry and the social construction of knowledge in which both
academics and students in higher education engage.
Theoretically I position myself variously within a hermeneutic and postmodern
framework, using the tension between these perspectives to both advance and interrogate
my work. I argue that this methodological tension mirrors the dilemma of the
contemporary university, caught as it is between traditional unities and postmodern
fragmentation. Ultimately I argue a case for a productive space at the intersection of the
hermeneutic and the postmodern - a space where the university and educational research
might flourish.
I locate my empirical study within a historical and contemporary, international and local
higher education context. In doing so I highlight the contemporary tension between a
traditional, scholarly, higher education culture and a market driven, performative culture.
This tension is evident both in the paradoxical nature of recent research and in the results
of my empirical study.
In terms of empirical work, previous quantitative research in the area of the
research/teaching 'nexus' has focused primarily on the co-relation between research
productivity and student evaluations of teaching and indicates little or no relation between the two. In contrast qualitative studies, which have focused on academics' experiences of
the relation, suggest a close connection between research and teaching with discipline and
level of teaching being the principal determinants of variation. I argue that the complexity
of research, teaching and the research/teaching relation has been ignored in institutional
discourses and in the co-relational research and under-appreciated in qualitative studies.
In order to reveal this complexity I explore the individual's experience as a coherent
whole or multi-phenomenal field, which embraces knowledge, research, teaching and
learning and their inter-relation. My analysis reveals significant variation in experience
of the research/teaching relation at undergraduate level from a weak relation to a total
integration of the two phenomena.
I open up the discourse of the relation at a detailed level through an exploration of the
metaphors academics use to describe their experiences of research, teaching, learning and
knowledge and of the research/teaching relation. Those academics experiencing a weak
relation use orientational metaphors which emphasise its hierarchical nature (research is
divorced from or at best informs teaching). Those experiencing an integrated relation use
metaphors emphasising the shared (teacher and student) construction of knowledge.
These outcomes raise important questions about structures of knowledge and the nature of
disciplinary inquiry, about networks of power and about the nature of the pedagogical
relationship which determines students' participation in a community of inquiry. There is
a direct relation between academics' experiences of knowledge (which are embedded in a
disciplinary context) and their approaches to research, teaching and learning. These
experiences may also be instrumental in shaping pedagogical relations of power.
In conclusion I advocate a higher education community based on the notion of shared
(academic/student) inquiry within disciplines and increasingly, at disciplinary
intersections. My study suggests that, to survive in the twenty-first century, the university
needs to harness its fragmentation productively by seeking not agreement but robust interdisciplinary
dialogue that might enable us to live beside and understand one other while
benefiting from our heterogeneity. I argue that such dialogue must enable us to use the
perspective of the other to reflect critically on our own positions and practices.",,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/2937",,,,"en",,,,,"University of Canterbury.

structure of advanced industrial society and of his
prediction concerning the resistance it will generate.
Comparisons are made between the thought of Illich and
selected themes of acknowledged post-industrial theorists.
I conclude that Illich and the post-industrialists are
in basic agreement regarding the structure of the power
elite, the alienation of the people and the function of
the education system. They agree too that the central
dilemma of advanced societies lies outside the political
domain. They also concur regarding the nature of the
resistance the power elite will generate. However Illich's
account of those likely to resist does not conform to that
of other analysts although it is rarely in direct conflict
with it. Therefore Illich, it is argued, is not to be
viewed as a lone critic of advanced industrial society
but as an exponent of the post-industrial perspective of
social forecasting.
I argue on the basis of these similarities that
Illich's social analysis stands and falls on the strengths
and weaknesses of post-industrial theory. Post-industrial
themes in Illich's work are extended to construct a
defence of his writings against the Marxist critique.
I suggest however, that the post-industrial themes render
him vulnerable to criticisms that have been levelled at
other post-industrial analyses of society. His analysis of
the resistance movement is also questioned both from within
post-industrialism and from without.
Finally it is argued that Illich's own analysis
helps to protect post-industrial theory from the common
criticism that it misrepresents the nature of service
agencies in advanced societies.",,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/2936",,,,"en",,,,,"University of Canterbury.

aspects that help and hinder that process, were explored within this research. Semi
structured interviews with seven adults, parentally bereaved as primary school aged
children, established a base for subsequent interviews with nine recently parentally
bereaved children, their families and teachers.
Findings revealed that parentally bereaved children, upon re-entry into school, feel
different, often describe themselves as being 'inside a bubble' and have a survival
tendency to daydream. Expressed strongly is their desire for normality at school,
within which a need for non-public nurture exists. School is often seen as a safe
place away from the trauma of the new home environment.
Effective two-way communication between the school and home needs to be
established by the school to effect the best re-entry and ongoing support for the
child. The teacher plays a key role in communication with the family and child and in
provision of initial support and ongoing monitoring of the child's well-being. The
majority of schools are seen as inadequately prepared for supporting parentally
bereaved children and need to consider staff training and pro-active planning in
order to facilitate the best re-entry possible.
The loss of a parent in a child's life is traumatic. Bereaved children who work
through the process with the best outcomes and have less chance of being at risk,
are those who are supported within an environment that provides love, respect,
security and open communication. The grief of our children deserves significant
input in order for those supporting them to achieve the most desirable outcomes.",,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/2935",,,,"en",,,,,"University of Canterbury.

The study took place over nine months, and consisted of 20-minute direct instruction sessions on phonological-processing skills and alphabetic knowledge and understanding, supported by other daily practice sessions as suggested by the programme's curriculum. Children were administered a range of tests on phonological-processing skills, word attack and identification, and reading comprehension and attitude at the beginning, middle and end of the study period. Comparisons and analysis of the data revealed that there were differences with all groups; i.e., those achieving in reading at, above, or below their expected level, with all aspects tested. Because of other interventions put into place by the classroom teacher, it is not possible to fully attribute the development of skills and understanding, and acquisition of knowledge, to the implementation of the programme.

totality of Life in the planet). Secondly, there is a
need for a ""down to earth"" theory useful to people
engaged in adult and community education which confronts
the difficulties of identifying and selecting an
appropriate theory of change. The difficulties arise
from the current confusion between the two major
conceptual frameworks: the ""Environmental Theory"" and the
""Ecological Theory"" . This thesis (centered on gender
analysis of hierarchy) scrutinizes their conceptual
differences within the global context of the ""hierarchy
of nations"" based on the sexual International Division of
Labour.
The ""Introduction"" examines the nature of REAL. It
explains the reasons why it is necessary to conceive a
theory on social, cultural and ethical change guided by
eco-feminist knowledge, consciousness and wisdom. It
identifies the difficulties of conceptual discrimination
between multiple theories and enables the selection of a
theory that goes beyond the reformist constraints of
""Environmentalist Theory"" and the internal contradictions
of ""Ecological Theory"".
The first chapter describes a case-study of
ecological adult learning in a Third World Country:
Venezuela (1977 - 1990). There, theory and practice are
being incorporated by the community to meet basic needs
in an environment of scarcity. The second chapter
evaluates a case study in the environment of abundance
and over-consumption of a First World country - New
Zealand ( 1982-1990) - under the rule of the Fourth
Labour Government. It focuses on the transition: from a
welfare state into a competitive free-market society
manipulated by the neo-liberal financial New Right. In
both case-studies, the achievements as well as the
constraints and difficulties encountered at ideological
and practical levels, are described .
Chapter Three follows the development of a theory
of change. Grounded on the practical experiences of the
1970's and the 1980's, it attempts to find new conceptual
guidelines for future educational work and action in the
community. Firstly, it highlights the differences
between two major theories that tend to be confused:
""Environmental Theory"" (which goals for change are low)
and ""Ecological Theory"" which aims to a total
transformation guided by ecological wisdom. The first one
is the context of ""Adult Environmental Education"" (AEE).
The development of REAL theory continues with the
analysis of three conceptual frameworks: the first two
are studied in the context of the ""Environmental Theory"".
They are: the ""Free-Market Environmentalism"" of the Neoliberal
New Right, and the Neo-Marxist ""Post-Industrial
Environmentalism"". The third framework of ""Eco-feminism""
is examined in the context of the ""Ecological Theory"".
To analyse the three conceptual frameworks, their values,
assumptions and main arguments, they are compared to try
to identify similarities and differences between them and
to establish their internal contradictions and
ambiguities. Eventually, one framework is selected and
integrated with a particular theory of Adult Learning, to
become REAL.
Finally, Chapter Four offers guidelines for the
practical implementation of REAL. These guidelines,
organized as a programme, are based on a theory grounded
on evaluation of past experiences which is integrated
with other significant key theories. Real Ecology Adult
Learning aims to challenge and to change the hierarchical
roots of exploitation, domination and manipulation of
People and Nature in 1990 and beyond, towards the new
millennia.",,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/3157",,,,"en",,,,,"University of Canterbury.

In order to contextualise the students’ narratives, data from primary school site personnel, the principals and Board of Trustees chairperson of the students’ schools were gathered. The research also involved interviews with Ministry of Education and Group Special Education personnel, to gain an understanding of the Ministry’s perspective on how it meets the differing needs of students, caregivers and schools. An analysis of the two schools’ policy and procedures, and relevant documents, with regard to stand-down, suspension and exclusion of primary-aged students was also undertaken.

Qualitative research methodologies enabled me to explore the lived experiences of these young people excluded from primary school, from the subjects’ own frame of reference. Data were collected using participant observations, document analysis, and in-depth semi-structured interviews. Kaumātua support for both the researcher, and the whānau involved, was sought with the aim of ensuring that the research proceeded in culturally appropriate and safe ways.

The research aimed to keep the students’ stories central to the discussions.

One of the key themes that emerged from the students’ narratives was the impact of being repeatedly framed by focusing solely on their behaviour. The impact of institutionalised racism evident within these educational life histories highlights the children’s struggle to persevere and survive in what they describe as hostile, racist, uncaring school environments. 

A key issue as outlined by the caregivers in this study has been the lack of understanding and support from or genuine partnership with their children’s education providers. The caregivers spoke of the effect that the disciplinary exclusion had on their relationship with their child and on their lives. Eventually the caregivers too become angry about, disengaged from and disillusioned with an education system that allows young people to be removed from schools, based solely on their behaviour.

The themes that emerged from discussions with schools centred on lack of support and follow-up from government agencies. School personnel were critical of the length of time it took to access support packages from the Ministry of Education. They discussed the impact of Tomorrow’s Schools, particularly the current legislation on stand-downs, suspensions and exclusions. School personnel suggest their ability to manage high needs students is further complicated by the existence of kiwi suspensions and geographical school zones.

This thesis stresses that it is critical for the students’ voices to remain central to discussions concerning their own education, so their creative ideas for possible solutions can help to create pathways forward.",,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/2851",,,,"en",,,,,"University of Canterbury.

experienced New Entrant teacher. She was initially interviewed about her perceptions of
the possible outcomes for a Year 1 male student exhibiting challenging behaviour and
this interview was followed by an assessment of the student's social and emotional
competence using the Reintegration Readiness Scale. The information from the RRS
assessment was then used to develop an Individual Behaviour Plan (IBP) for the student.
Following an eight week intervention, a second RRS and a second interview were
conducted. Despite a decrease in scores in the second RRS, results from the interviews
indicated that the teacher perceived the Reintegration Readiness Scale as helpful in
increasing her understanding of the student and his behaviour, which in tum, led to
improved communication with the student's parents. The teacher reported the RRS as an
easy-to-use framework from which to develop an Individual Behaviour Plan for the target
student. The teacher noted that the focus on the student's social and emotional
competency 'refreshed' her own professional development around managing challenging
behaviour. She also found the information the RRS provided useful for planning and
implementing a class-wide social skills unit on sharing and tum taking. Future research is

commonplace in New Zealand classrooms, the question arises as to what
teachers are making of the technology. The present study draws on the
responses from some 8000 teachers to a survey repeated over four years.
The survey sought information in teachers' ICT usage and skills prior to
entry into a professional development programme. The study found few
changes for the average teachers' use of lCT in the classroom between
1999 and 2003. Of the changes that occurred, increases in some of the
personal ICT skill levels of teachers are among the most marked. This
includes an increase in skills in file management, word processing,
emailing, and Internet use. For the average teacher, these skills have,
however, remained relatively basic. Within the classroom, these basic
skills are used mainly for administration as well as planning and
preparation, while some increases in skill levels was evident in the areas
of Internet use for accessing lesson ideas, assessment, reading official
documents, and other professional readings. There have been some
increases in the use of lCT for administration, in particular for
records/assessment, and writing reports for parents. Integration of lCT
into classroom teaching and learning remains unchanged and at a low
level during the years studied. Usage of ICT by students of the average
teacher have changed little between 1999 and 2003. Important changes
can be seen, however, in those teachers with a high degree of skills and
usage. Growth in their level of skills is occurring, although the numbers
are small.
That teachers use ICT mainly for administration purposes as well as for
planning and preparation, suggests ICT is currently being 'undersold' as a
tool for teaching and learning. Before ICT can be fully integrated by teachers, literature cited in this report points to the need for professional
development programmes to focus on pedagogical change.",,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/3155",,,,"en",,,,,"University of Canterbury.

mainstream Year 10 class, in a co-educational urban school. Many students in the
class displayed a lack of endurance with set tasks, and needed prompting to complete
a minimum amount of work. Some expressed a lack of confidence in their ability to
succeed in the subject, and were easily distracted. The teacher approached the
school's Resource Teacher: Learning and Behaviour (RTLB) to explore possible
strategies, that when delivered to the whole class, would be of benefit to all students.
Their subsequent collaboration involved the RTLB adopting the role of researcher,
while the teacher implemented an intervention designed to measure the effects of a
combination of strategies.
The students involved in this study displayed a lack of motivation and an apathetic
attitude toward mathematics work. They expressed frustration, and a sense of
helplessness in the classroom. This was indicated by a range of behaviour and
utterances, which included, ""How are we supposed to remember all that?"" ""What's he
going on about?"" They gave up on tasks readily, and had to be constantly reminded
to get on with their work. It was noticeable in the classroom that the teacher spent a
great deal of time responding to individual student's requests for help. Despite
students having the resources to help themselves, they did not do so spontaneously. It
was posited that using advance organizers might help them to regulate their own activities more effectively, enabling them to become independent learners and
improving self-efficacy levels.
Academic engaged time and student achievement were measured pre and post
intervention. Student feedback was sought in the form of a questionnaire and semistructured
interview. Results indicate advance organizers, in combination with other
strategies, are an effective tool that can contribute to improving student achievement
and can re-orient student effort in appropriate ways.
A number of implications for teachers and classroom practice were made, most
significantly, that when advance organizers are used in conjunction with other
carefully selected strategies, and presented to learners as part of a well-designed
classroom programme, learning is enhanced, and students report, more enjoyable.",,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/3014",,,,"en",,,,,"University of Canterbury.

when they are setting up learning environments and activities for cbildren. The
challenge for teachers is to develop realistic activities with which children can
engage and to encourage children to explore flexible approaches to problem-solving.

influences on the anxiety levels of pregnant women.
Subjects were 258 women (91 primi-, 107 dui-, and 60

92 were currently attending antenatal classes, 87 were
not currently attending antenatal classes but had previously

Subjects completed the Pregnancy Research Questionnaire

reactions were derived. A background information questionnaire
was also completed by each subject and was used
to obtain details on the subject's environment.
Two sets of analyses were undertaken. Firstly,
multiple regression analyses were used to examine the
extent to which anxiety measures could be predicted from
the set of environmental details. The results indicated
that anxiety and other measures were very difficult to
predict and that attendance at antenatal classes did not
make a substantial contribution to such prediction. The
most potent influence on anxiety levels (in terms of
proportion of variance accounted for) appeared to be
degree of financial security (with high anxiety associated
with low financial security). A multivariate analysis
of variance (MANOVA) was also used to ascertain the
characteristics which distinguished highly anxious
women from others in the sample. A variety of factors
differentiated these groups and among such factors, the
importance of degree of financial security was apparent.
A series of exploratory analyses (MANOVA's) were also
undertaken and the implication of financial insecurity
as an influence on maternal anxiety was again indicated.
The results were discussed in terms of the difficulties
involved in assessing environmental influences, the
implications for future antenatal course planning, and

the relationship, of certain factors thought to be associated with school
alienation. After completion of several pilot studies concerned with
developing valid and reliable instruments, a representative sample of
fifteen Canterbury secondary schools was selected and 674 fourth form
students from those schools responded to a questionnaire measuring
school alienation, perceived school bureaucratization, perceived conflict
of values, and achievement motivation.
Results indicated that school alienation is comprised of five
dimensions which can be subsumed under a single factor. Perceived school
bureaucratization consists of six dimensions which may be subsumed under
two factors: Bureaucratic Organisation and Development of Expertise.
The first of these factors contributed 20.63% to the variance of school
alienation and was positively related to that variable, while the second
contributed 5.48% to variance and was negatively related to the criterion.
Perceived conflict of values consists of five dimensions which may be
subsumed under the two factors of Conflict over Present-oriented School
Values and Conflict over Future-oriented School Values. Both factors were
significantly and positively related to school alienation, with the former
contributing 1.11% to variance, and the latter 1.23%. Achievement
motivation was not significantly related to school alienation. In all,
44.53% of the total variance of school alienation was explained, of which
28.45% was contributed by the experimental variable.s, and 16.08% by the
controls.
It was concluded that student dissatisfaction with school apparently
focuses on the perceived bureaucratic organisation of the school, and on
perceived student-school conflict over values which the student has about
school and the extent to which the school puts those values into effect.
Of particular interest was the implication that school has 'intrinsic'
meaning for students; furthermore, school experience seems to be
interpreted by students as being an inevitable part of life which has
important implications for future status.",,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/3511",,,,"en",,,,,"University of Canterbury.

or therapeutic interviews actually interferes with the counselling process. The few empirical studies of the
effects of recording are inconsistent in their findings and their methodological flaws preclude meaningful
interpretation of the literature as a whole (Goldstein, 1988). This qualitative research study focuses on one
aspect of recording counselling interviews; the perceptions of counselling students. Thirteen counselling
students enrolled on counsellor education programmes at five tertiary educational settings in Auckland and
Christchurch, New Zealand participated in interviews. They indicated that they perceived the process of
recording to be anxiety promoting, initially having an effect on their ability to be completely present in the
counselling interview. They also reported that recording was extremely beneficial to the development of
effective counselling skills. Counsellors perceived the process of recording to be a potential threat to the
developing relationship between counsellor and client but many were able to manage this concern by
establishing trust and rapport before introducing recording. The majority of the student counsellors
perceived that they became more confident with the process over time, moving from a state of anxiety in
initial recordings to a more relaxed style with practice. This has implications for future practice and for early
introduction to frequent recording in counsellor education programmes.",,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/3192",,,,"en",,,,,"University of Canterbury.

"4082","10092/806",,,"Anderson, Kathy",,,,,,,,"2003",,,"This thesis investigates understandings that secondary school art teachers hold
about assessment of year 11 students' artwork. My experience as an art educator
has lead to my interest in this area. Boughton (1997) also argues that there is a
need for more systematic investigation to underpin the practices of assessment in
art.
An analysis of the fields of art education and assessment provided the context for
the study and also informed the research process and research question. The
field of art and art education is historically and theoretically contested and this
influences curricula design and examination prescriptions creating a complex
field for teachers to be involved in.
A qualitative approach was chosen using unstructured interviews, participant
observations in classroom settings and document analysis. Three female and
three male teachers participated. The schools were similar sizes and included
state, private, co- educational, single sex and semi rural. All teachers were
trained and three were practising artists.
Kvale cited in Hill (2001) explains how unstructured interviews allow openness
to changes in sequences and forms of questions in order to follow up the answers
given and stories told by participants. This was important in this study as the
conversations of teachers refocused discussions during follow-up visits.
Assessment events were videoed and replayed to participants to stimulate
discussion. A qualitative approach was seen as appropriate for this project as the
field of art education that teachers work in is continually being redefined and
reconstructed.
The writing process continually evolved as I read the literature. Burr (1995:4)
provided insights into social constructionist methods describing how II our
current accepted ways of understanding the world is a product not of objective
observation of the world, but of the social processes and interactions in which people are constantly engaged with each other."" As my writing evolved, the
research question was redefined. Originally the research focus had been to find
out how teachers went about assessing art. This was refocused into how they
position themselves and are affected by the competing discourses in art
education. It seemed that the data analysis and writing processes informed each
other.
The findings revealed three interconnecting layers, which provided insights into
teachers' assessment practices. These layers included new assessment discourses
such as standards based and formative assessment methods, summative
assessment and national examination discourses, and traditional views about
intelligence. The teachers' assessment methods were dominated by summative
pressures, which resulted in professional concerns for teachers. These included:
knowing what was acceptable practice,; needing to have agreement; maintaining
standards; and establishing subject status for art education. The influence of
traditional ideas about academic intelligence also seemed important to these
teachers and contributed to maintaining the status of art education. These
teachers used ideas about academic intelligence to categorize students' abilities
and to inform assessment judgements.
The thesis concludes by asking why art teachers have continued to value
summative assessments, which have resulted in a narrow formalist approach in
classroom practice and continual controversy about assessment judgements. It
seems that the status of art education is validated through examination results. It
appeared from this study that positioning art within an academic examination
structure has compromised the curriculum basis for art education.",,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/3616",,,,"en",,,,,"University of Canterbury.

something the slower children needed to use, and grouping practices favoured
a whole class approach. Involvement in the Numeracy Project saw changes in
perceptions and classroom practice. Teachers were able to identify realistic
outcomes for children and showed a greater understanding of how children
learn the concepts associated with fractions, decimals, and percentages.
Flexible grouping, relevant use of concrete materials for all children, and
focused interactions were identified as areas of classroom delivery that needed
to be investigated further.

the use of drama in education as a significant means of

first to drama as an aspect of play, treating, a number of
theories of learning, and then to role and personality
theories. A synthesis of views is advanced as a model of
the way in which drama's use of interaction with others may
provide a developmental framework. It may enhance pupils'
stimulus-seeking and their need to experience effective
competence in dealings with their environment, so opening
a channel to heightened creativity and 'self-actualization'.
The hypotheses seek to confirm that junior secondary pupils
undertaking a drama programme will show enhanced scores on
certain personality variables when compared with non-drama
pupils. Concepts tested include self-acceptance and self-inconstancy;
conditions assessed are creativity, empathy,
extraversion/introversion and neuroticism. Experimental
and control groups are described, selection and creation of
tests detailed and a record of the experimental programme
is presented. The findings neither prove nor disprove the

of the First Four Ships in December 1850, to 1857: a year
which is notable tor the passing of the first Education

infancy of the New Zealand education system.
Knowledge of the facts about education in early
Canterbury is very inadequate. It is not known how many
schools existed, when they opened or closed, who their
teaohers were or how many pupils attended them. Knowledge
of what school books were used, what fees charged, or
what subjects taught is equally slight. For this reason
detailed accounts of the origins and growth of schools will
be given, and an attempt made to fill in some of these 
gaps in our knowledge of the vital facts or the period.
Alongside this there will be an attempt to see the
development of education during this period as something
dynamic, arising in the minds or the founders of the
Canterbury Association influenced as they were by mid-nineteenth
century ideas about church and school transferred
to the settlement, where the ideals were changed by impact
with the colonial situation, where the old problems which
the colonists had hoped to have left behind them appeared
again, sometimes in another form. Here the main emphasis

Students from Mainland China, one of the most populous countries in the world and, until quite recently closed to the rest of the world, have, in the past few years, made up the large majority of those who come to New Zealand to study. Those wishing to enter university after completing high school in China must acquire a specified level of English and successfully complete a two semester long Foundation Studies course, before being eligible for undergraduate study. Research into independent or self-regulated learning has shown that Western (mainly American) students are much more successful academically and enjoy their studies more if they are willing and able to self-regulate their learning. This research has occurred mostly in Western settings with Western participants. The present research using a mixed methods approach aimed to examine the self-regulated learning, epistemological beliefs, demographic factors and personality traits of  Mainland Chinese students studying in the Foundation Studies course and to determine whether any of these factors appeared to have any appreciable effect on their experiences in the course and on their final outcomes. The research found that while no one specific factor seemed to determine experiences and outcomes, it would appear that personality characteristics of face, optimism and other Dependability scores may mediate factors such as ability (measured by grades), length of time in the country, self-regulated learning and motivational strategies (such as organisation, time management, effort regulation and self-efficacy), and previous independent learning to influence these experiences and outcomes. While it appears that the North American theory of self-regulated learning is applicable to these students, it seems that cultural beliefs may affect which self-regulatory factor is most salient in their academic outcomes.

I have woven the stories of myself (pango), a Pākēhā colleague (mā), and our joint conversations (whero) into a discussion about current education. The project also reviews literature about Mātauranga Māori¹ in schools. This research addresses questions about key principles that makes Mātauranga Māori effective in the classrooms, the effectiveness of the teaching systems, and the factors that effect the achievement (and under-achievement) of Māori tauira. I followed Coates’ (1991) example and wrote an autobiography that explored my early learning and my life as a scholar and as an educator. I shared my autobiographical writing with a Pākēhā pouako colleague who has had her own personal experiences in education and an upbringing in an environment which is totally different to mine. I report on some important discussions that arose when we shared our experiences with one another and talked about our views on teaching and learning systems. This research suggests that when Mātauranga Māori is effective, it has a positive impact on the engagement of all Māori and Pākēhā tauira. Schools implementing a Mātauranga Māori approach need to examine the quality of the teaching systems and relationships within their schools and also with their whānau and hāpori (community) as these will have an important impact on the tauira, involving their experiences of whanāūngatanga² (belonging). The school’s principles, values and knowledge involving personnel and student relationships will shape the kind of environment where achievement can eventually grow. According to McAdam & Lang (2003), “The school is at the heart of the future of the community. It is the schools where tauira grow in knowledge, morality, their abilities to relate to others, their concepts of community and the ability to live life to the full. It is in the schools that the future of our societies gains formation and direction” (p. 50), and it is schools that are the core of this research study. But schools are also about people, primarily tauira, pouako, and those who carry out professional roles to assist with the dynamic functions of schools. This study considers two such professionals whose cultures are different, but whose philosophies about knowledge generally and Mātauranga Māori, are compatible.

"4071","10092/806",,,"Coates, Ainslee Claire",,,,,,,,"2003",,,"This thesis explores two teachers' perspectives and practice through making explicit the
various discourses they operated in. By exploring these discourses, teachers may be able to
understand the ways they conceptualise curriculum and consider how their own practices in
the classroom are informed by and reflect particular beliefs. It is hoped that through this
process opportunities exist to explore new ways of working that ultimately benefit children in
classrooms.
The purpose of this study is to investigate how change, loss and grief as a relatively new
learning context in Health and Physical Education in the New Zealand Curriculum (Ministry
of Education, 1999) is conceptualized and implemented in the classroom. The perspectives
and practice of two primary school teachers were used in a case study design to explore how
this particular aspect of health education is implemented.
The process of teaching and learning is extremely complex and exploring it brought many
challenges. The various discourses that seemed to guide, shape and determine the case study
teachers' classroom practice are examined. The dominant discourse of the teacher as an
'expert' was pervasive and was illustrated in many of the teachers ideas, beliefs and practices.
This discourse seemed to work implicitly to influence the way that these teachers
conceptualized change, loss and grief and how they then implemented this topic in the
classroom.
The implications of this study highlight the crucial role of specific and focused professional
development in enabling teachers to recognize and critique their own practice within their
existing teaching and learning belief systems. Through this process, teachers may be able to
explore new teaching pedagogy that could challenge the existing and dominant discourses that
operate in the classroom. The study raises questions about the effectiveness of existing
professional development programmes in changing classroom practice and suggests some
specific strategies that may more effectively close the gap between theory and practice.",,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/3595",,,,"en",,,,,"University of Canterbury.

"4021","10092/806",,,"Carter, Karen",,,,,,,,"2003",,,"Teachers who are itinerant contend with many factors that complicate their ability
to deliver programmes. This thesis investigates the experiences of one such group
of itinerant educators, Itinerant Teachers of Music (ITMs). They are responsible for
the teaching of instrumental music in secondary schools in AotearoalNew Zealand.
I used a case study to examine the phenomenon of itinerancy and considered the
experiences of ITMs and ITM Co-ordinators in the Canterbury region and the
views of the Heads of Music Departments (HoDs Music) with whom they work.
This included observing ITMs at work and interviewing ITMs, ITM Co-ordinators,
and HoDs Music about being itinerant. I consulted strategic documents such as
music education reports, curriculum statements and job descriptions to examine the
place of ITMs in official music education discourses.
A social constructionist perspective underpins the research. Social constructionism
emphasises the socially constructed reality of ITMs' experiences and raises issues
of power and access to those discourses that define itinerancy.
I argue that itinerancy as encountered by ITMs is characterised by three main
themes: temporality, invisibility and adaptability. Time dominates itinerant work.
Teaching is compressed into twenty minute blocks, travel times are minimised. An
ITMs day is intensive, with scarcely a wasted minute. This influences the quality
oftheir work and interactions with colleagues. Their present situation is affected by
historical discourses of itinerancy, their future determined by current restrictions.
To be itinerant, with multiple work sites and frequent travel is to be largely
invisible. This invisibility, as ITMs engage in their work, impacts on their identity,
status, relationships and place in schools and educational discourses. Adaptability
and flexibility are essential ITM traits. ITMs are required to conform to the
demands and expectations .of diverse school systems, HoDs Music and students, as
well as their own employers, as they work within systemic constraints. They are
multi-skilled musicians and teachers.

ITMs work in conditions intensified by itinerancy where temporality, invisibility
and adaptability are the criteria by which they are defined and they have defined
themselves. I conclude with nine recommendations for change that involve a
review of the operational structures regulating the practice of itinerancy in the ITM
programme and an examination of the resources allocated to it.",,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/3552",,,,"en",,,,,"University of Canterbury.

them is problematic. This study sets out to explore what Year Six children respond to in the
music they prefer and how this compares to their responses to examples of 'classical' music in
an effort to find areas of commonality and transferability.
A constructivist perspective underpins this study. In examining the children's responses to
music in their own words, their understandings about music and how it shapes their lives
becomes evident.
Case study is used to examine the listening responses of Year Six children. Children express in
their own terms what they listen to and for within music: music of their own choice, and then
""classical"" music. They share their expectations and give examples of ""good"" music.
The findings that emerge from this study fall into two broad themes: those relating to
children's choices, and those that relate to the nature and importance of the discourses about
listening to music within the educational setting. These findings have a number of implications.
Firstly, they indicate the importance of ""stories"" the children gained from the music listened to.
Secondly, they suggest the significance of the relationship children form with music. Thirdly,
they mark the importance of an awareness of the different perspectives and cultural settings
from which music listening and appreciation is viewed.

while it examines a single aspect of music education at this level, the implications may be
explored within other levels and curriculum areas.",,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/3597",,,,"en",,,,,"University of Canterbury.

"2731","10092/806",,,"Ichijima, Emiko",,,,,,,,"2009",,,"Introduction: Past studies have indicated that nursing support reduces parental stress and anxiety during a child’s NICU hospitalisation and therefore fosters the parents’ abilities to cope with the difficulties they are facing. The importance of parental support has been emphasised in numerous studies in Western countries, however the nursing support which is responsive to the parents may vary between different cultures. The cultural norms of medical and nursing care environments can affect parental stress-related experiences as well as nursing roles in the NICUs across different countries. The aims of this study are, first, to compare the medical and nursing care environments of the two NICUs. Second, the study establishes any similarities and differences in sources of parental stress in the two NICUs. Third, the study illustrates the underlying philosophy of Doane and Varcoe’s (2005) relational approach to family nursing and highlights the importance of relational inquiry in the process of determining the parental support which best responds to individual families’ needs in the NICU.

Methods: This study analyses the nursing roles that support parents of children hospitalised in a Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU). It is a cross-cultural comparison between two NICUs, one in Christchurch, New Zealand and the other in Tokyo, Japan, with both quantitative and qualitative components. Thirty-one families participated voluntarily in the study from each NICU (n=121). The three main sources of data were a NICU staff interview, parental interview, and parental questionnaire using the Parental Stress Scale: Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (PSS: NICU) (Miles, 2002). A thematic analysis was used in order to examine parental comments.

Results: The differences between the two NICUs in terms of the NICU care environment, including NICU regulations and routine nursing care, were identified by the staff interviews, highlighting the contrasting dominant ideologies of individualism and collectivism reflected in each culture. The three sources of parental stress, measured by PSS: NICU: Sights and Sounds; Baby’s Appearance and Behaviour; the Parental Role Alteration, were examined. The sources most responsible for parental stress differed between the four groups of parents. Overall, The Tokyo parents seemed to be most concerned about the infant’s condition. The Christchurch parents, however, perceived the change in parental role to be most stressful. Additionally, only the Tokyo fathers experienced stress in association with Sights and Sounds more often than other areas of stress. The infant’s medical/nursing care requirements, oxygen therapy and/or tube feeding, were associated with a high degree of stress for each of the parents’ groups except that of the Christchurch fathers. There was a positive relationship between parental NICU visiting and stress level among the Tokyo parents while this was not the case for the Christchurch parents. The infants’ and parental characteristics were found to be associated with stress level for the Tokyo mothers and Christchurch fathers only. The thematic analysis of interview data revealed three key themes of NICU parental experiences: Uncertainty, NICU contexts and Communication with staff. These themes were identical between the two NICUs.

Discussion: This study highlighted the influence of the norms of each NICU, particularly the NICU regulations and nursing care on parental stress-related experiences, and the importance of reflecting upon these norms to critique those professional beliefs which may hamper parental coping abilities. The areas of parental support needing attention were different between the two NICUs. These areas were: the establishment of oral feeding, and infants’ nursing care-related decision-making for the Christchurch NICU whilst parental information/involvement in the early stage of hospitalisation, the influence of visiting regulations, and  importing Western-based NICU intervention for the Tokyo NICU. In providing these areas of parental support, the importance of effective, meaningful communication between parents and staff was equally evident in the two NICU settings. In the light of the relational approach to family nursing, this study demonstrated that how nurses communicate with families is not universal: one way to reach across the differences is to listen to parents, and this, it is clear, is crucial to the role of nurses in NICU settings.",,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/2372",,,,"en",,,,,"University of Canterbury.

Universities and polytechnics in Aotearoa New Zealand will have to change in many ways before sustainability can be considered to occupy a meaningful place in the tertiary education sector.  However the change process that sees an organisation moving towards sustainability is complex, and agency for change can be considered on many different levels including the individual identities of staff and students, the identity of managers, and the programme and wider organisational identities constructed by the communities that comprise them. 

This qualitative research explores education for sustainability within the context of outdoor education using the Bachelor of Adventure Recreation and Outdoor Education (BRecEd) at the Christchurch Polytechnic Institute of Technology (CPIT) (the programme into which the author teaches) as a case study.  Participatory action research forms the overarching methodology for a multiple method approach to data collection.  The research leans heavily on the lived experiences of staff and students within the programme, is woven with my own reflections, and incorporates many examples of students’ work.  The weaving together of these experiences grounds the research and helps bring theory to life. 

The research reveals the complexity of change towards more sustainable ways of practising outdoor education in an organisational setting.  It explores the tensions that are encountered and mechanisms that have allowed for staff and students to engage in education for sustainability in a more meaningful way.  The key themes of the research explore the intersection of identity construction processes and change agency, and it is argued these processes are inseparable for those concerned with organisational change towards sustainability.",,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/3637",,,,"en",,,,,"University of Canterbury.

Given that over 85% of Māori students are currently in mainstream settings rather than Māori medium settings the Government has initiated and supported teacher professional development 
approaches in efforts to enhance teacher effectiveness for teachers working with Māori in mainstream settings. 

This investigation looks specifically at the practice of four teachers who have been on the Te Kauhua/Māori in Mainstream Pilot project in a decile1 5 Intermediate school in the South Island of New Zealand. An important aspect of this investigation is that it listens to and includes the voices and opinions of eight students who are in the classes of these teachers. Early on in the Te Kauhua project teachers at the school articulated that it was the lack of engagement from their Māori students that was the problem and they wanted to look at ways in which they could maximise Māori student engagement 
in the classroom learning contexts. 

The particular aim of this investigation was to look at specific strategies and practices that teachers used to successfully maximise Māori student engagement in the classroom curriculum. The results highlighted the importance of the quality of the relationship between the teacher and the students, the positive impact of the extra effort that teachers applied to engage their students and the students’ preferences for working in small groups. Underpinning these aspects of practice was the importance that teachers placed on developing their reflective practice and the participation in small learning professional learning groups.",,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/3479",,,,"en",,,,,"University of Canterbury.

The qualitative method of data collection for the study comprised of three focus groups, two with foster parents and one with grandparents. The focus groups were conducted using a modified Nominal Group Technique (NGT) where two questions posed to the participants sought to understand their views about behaviours they noticed in children in their care before and after contact with birth parents. In addition, a further question was asked to gain an understanding around their feelings on contact with birth parents.  
Findings of the study indicated that foster parents largely described children’s behaviour before and after contact to be distressing and stressful for them, with few positive benefits. Furthermore, foster parents mainly stated strong, negative feelings around contact with biological parents.

"18219","10092/806",,,"Gautam, Seema",,,,,,,,"2017",,,"The research reported in this thesis investigated cognitive-linguistic predictors of reading comprehension (both within and across languages) among multilingual primary school children in the Punjab region of India. The participants of this study learn three languages: Punjabi, Hindi and English; and are exposed to all three from the initial stage of literacy acquisition. Unlike English, the Punjabi and Hindi orthographies are written nonlinearly with a horizontal bar on the top of the aksharas that connects aksharas within a word, and include vowel symbols that have independent and dependent forms. Both Punjabi and Hindi are alphasyllabic orthographies, whereas English is an alphabetic orthography.

Over 400 trilingual school children in Punjab (India) from grades 2 to 5 completed a measure of text reading comprehension that comprised passages followed by questions about details in those passages. Reading comprehension levels were compared to the measures of listening comprehension, phonological processing, orthographic knowledge and speed of processing. Analyses indicated the Punjabi, Hindi and English reading comprehension levels were predicted by measure of listening comprehension and word decoding, with the latter being predicted by phonological and orthographic skills. Such findings were consistent with current models of reading derived from studies of English. However, in contrast to these models, measures of orthographic skills were also predictive of variance in reading comprehension independent of word decoding across Punjabi, Hindi and English models. Contributions of phonological processing and speed of processing were also observed in the English reading comprehension model, again independent of word decoding processes. Overall, Punjabi and Hindi reading comprehension was predicted by similar predictors, with English reading comprehension showing more variations in predictors.

Further analyses investigated the influence of Punjabi and Hindi cognitive-linguistic skills on English reading levels. The findings indicated that, in the younger cohorts of students who are more likely to have less reading experience, the influence of Punjabi and Hindi measures on English was limited to word recognition. However, once these multilingual children acquire more expertise in decoding skills (i.e., in the older cohort), listening comprehension, orthographic knowledge and phonological processing in Punjabi and Hindi influenced levels in English reading comprehension.

The overall findings from this thesis were used to derive three multilingual models of Punjabi, Hindi and English and one cross-linguistic model of English reading comprehension. These models suggest that a simple view of reading could be applied to Punjabi and Hindi orthographies in a similar way to English. However, additional influences of orthographic knowledge for all three languages (Punjabi, Hindi and English) in such multi-literate learners will need to be taken into account. Additionally, the influence of first and second language skills will need to be considered when developing models of third language reading comprehension. The proposed four models that includes the additional factors are discussed in light of previous research and theories/models in the field.",,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/14614",,,,"en","English",,,,"University of Canterbury",,,,,,,"http://library.canterbury.ac.nz/thesis/etheses_copyright.shtml","All Rights Reserved",,,,,,,,,,,,"Predictors of Punjabi, Hindi and English reading comprehension among multilingual children in the Punjab Region of India",,,"Electronic Thesis or Dissertation",,,"Education","University of Canterbury",,"Doctoral",,,"Doctor of Philosophy",,"2566522",,,"College of Education, Health and Human Development, University of Canterbury",,"Seemagautam1980@gmail.com",,,,,,,,,"Professor John Everatt"
"18220","10092/806",,,"Hasnat, Mahammad Abul",,,,,,,,"2017",,,"This thesis explores the engagement practices, understandings and experiences of parents and teachers in the rural context in Bangladesh. It investigates the underlying factors that create blocks to engagement. It examines the complex interplay of expectations, blame-giving, financial constraints and pervasive social problems within the context, and how that interplay both calls for and yet inhibits engagement. The thesis also reports one head teacher’s initiatives to overcome the blocks and to create space for engagement.

The study is a qualitative case study that utilises an emergent research design. This process of data collection offered me the flexibility to respond to contextual conditions and to capture rich data through group discussions and individual conversations with the teachers, parents and the community people. It allowed me to observe participants’ activities, review related documents and maintain a reflective research journal. The importance of place is highlighted throughout as my study sought to identify and report not only actual practices but the cultural, social and economic conditions that shape those practices. Place contextualises where policy decisions are to be implemented. Place is also a significant consideration in identifying the kinds of steps that might be taken to overcome barriers. Therefore, attention is given to describing the rural context of Bangladesh and its people in some detail.

The study begins with examining the reasons for importance being placed on parental engagement by policy, and reports the problems in implementing policy aspirations in the rural context through the lenses of parents and teachers. It found that teachers were frustrated by lack of parental response to invitations and by their apparent disinterest in their children’s educational progress. It also found that parental illiteracy and poverty were major factors in preventing parents from becoming engaged with educational matters. Additional factors were unsatisfactory communication processes, the complex nature of the cultural relationship between parents and teachers, and the politicised nature of schools’ public programmes. I found of understandings, by both parents and teachers of the concept and possibilities of engagement were largely very limited.

The thesis explores how cultural and socio-economic conditions shape dominant discourses and arbitrate access to cultural capital as well as posing practical problems. These factors impede parental engagement in education and are powerful indicators of why such engagement is needed.

Next the study reports the activities of one head teacher who is taking a different approach in the same context. It details his different and innovative strategies for reaching out to parents and creating space for them to be become involved with their children’s learning and with the school. It also identifies a number of key characteristics of his leadership that allow him to make a difference and suggests that these characteristics are ones that should be looked for and fostered in appointment processes, professional development and official support.

Finally the implications for policy and practice of the findings are discussed. Two models are offered: the first of the nature and possibilities of parental engagement in rural contexts of Bangladesh; the second of the processes needed to develop parental engagement in such contexts.

The study is a deliberately contextual one. However, some of the contextual factors may have resonances with other contexts and other countries. Moreover the analysis of how contextual factors impact on parental engagement may also be relevant to other contexts. Therefore while the focus in on parental engagement in rural contexts in Bangladesh, it is envisaged that the study will also have wider relevance.",,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/14615",,,,"en","English",,,,"University of Canterbury",,,,,,,"http://library.canterbury.ac.nz/thesis/etheses_copyright.shtml","All Rights Reserved",,,,,,,,,,,,"Rural parents’ engagement in education in Bangladesh: problems and possibilities",,,"Electronic Thesis or Dissertation",,,"Education","University of Canterbury",,"Doctoral",,,"Doctor of Philosophy",,"2566525",,,"College of Education, Health and Human Development, University of Canterbury",,"mahammad.hasnat@pg.canterbury.ac.nz, mahasnat83@gmail.com",,,,,,,,,"Professor Janinka Greenwood"

The impetus for this research came from a desire to retain much of the interaction, participation, and engagement that takes place in smaller classes when changing from small lectures to lectures with more than 100 students.

A pilot study demonstrated that the use of applications on personally owned devices (APODs) in the form of a text messaging based system or an application running on a smart phone could create a marked increase in student interaction, participation, and engagement.

This was followed by a more formal investigation using a pragmatic paradigm and a mixed methods research approach that was consistent with design-based research. This included interviews of lecturers and learning advisers, student surveys and student focus groups.

The findings conclude that the use of APODs during lectures has the potential to increase student interaction. The participation and engagement through the creation of a two-way feedback channel between lecturers and students, allows for student misconceptions to be identified and addressed in a manner that can make learning more enjoyable, authentic and effective. This potential benefit can be realised by addressing the pedagogical and technological issues involved in the use of APODs in lectures.

The main contributions of this research are the models that have been developed surrounding how to use APODs in a pedagogically sound manner; the importance of designing effective activities when APODs are being used; how to use APODs to cater for different groups of students; the benefits of using APODs; and how to address the challenges of using APODs.

whether emotions pose any special problems for the
educator; and so on.
The first chapter looks at the nature of
emotions, and attempts to draw some sort of conceptual
map of the class of things we call 'emotions'.
The second chapter discusses the ways in which
we can he more, and less, rational about our emotions,
and a number of specific educational aims are
outlined.
The third chapter argues that educators influence
children’s emotions. This influence cannot be
undone simply by an adherence to rationality, and
leaves the educator facing some difficult questions
about the direction and nature of that influence.
To a degree he can answer this with reference to
mental health, human happiness, and a necessary
minimal social morality. But though this may provide
him with general guidelines, it will not justify the
specific influence he has on children's emotions.
The fourth chapter attempts to provide some
answers to this problem. The argument is that just
as comprehensive knowledge and rational thinking protects us from being indoctrinated with regards to
our beliefs, so comprehensive knowledge and
understanding of the emotions and values of other
people (something gained through the ability to
empathize) protects us from being indoctrinated with
regards to our emotions.
The final chapter looks briefly at the skills
needed to understand our own emotions, and to empathize
with other people: the ability to express and
communicate our feelings effectively.",,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/3994",,,,"en",,,,,"University of Canterbury.

which teachers implement the curriculum and undertake their teaching of physical
education.
The purpose of this study was to investigate what has influenced the development of
curriculum value orientations of teachers of physical education in secondary schools and
to consider the implications of these value orientations for curriculum implementation,
and consider the influences for teacher development, and in-service professional
development. The research utilised 'an existing inventory to establish the value
orientations of nineteen secondary school physical education teachers. Interviews were
then conducted to collect data from six of the teachers who formed two groups of three
with different value orientations. Interview data was analysed using the process of
constant comparison.
Analysis revealed that influences. which have impacted on the formation of these
teachers' value orientations can be classified within the categories of life experiences
before teacher education, influences during teacher education, influences in the school
setting and reflective practice. Findings indicate that secondary school physical
education teachers have different value orientations and a range of factors has shaped
their value orientations. These include teacher philosophy, teacher education,
professional development, life experiences, curriculum, colleagues, schools and reflective
practice.
The discussion investigates how and to what extent these influences have shaped
teachers' different value orientations. The value orientations and their implications for
curriculum implementation are discussed and then the influences themselves are
considered. Finally, in view of the influences, the implications for teacher education and
in-service professional development are discussed.
Teachers in this study enter teacher education with a sense of what it means to be a
physical education teacher based on their own experiences in life, school and sport in
particular. The way in which they interpret these experiences leads to different beliefs.
These beliefs lead to the development of a value orientation, which in tum influences the
way in which teachers make curriculum decisions, plan, implement and deliver their
physical education programmes.
This research indicates the extent to which life expenences, teacher education, and
professional development impacts on value orientation is variable, but in order to create a
change in value orientations, a key component is the development of critical reflection as
a well established and ongoing habit. The study suggests that having an understanding of
and an awareness of value orientations will enable teachers to consider their beliefs and
the influences on these, and to make infonned decisions about curriculum and practice.",,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/3754",,,,"en",,,,,"University of Canterbury.

small group of students completing a one year course in secondary teacher
education at the Christchurch College of Education. Seven students were
interviewed, observed and surveyed over a period of eight months, to track the
development in their conceptions and the factors impacting on this
development. The phenomenographic interview formed the primary means
of data collection. Conceptions emerging from the data were categorised in
terms of their fundamental differences.
Findings are presented in two parts. Firstly a profile of each student is
constructed from the data gathered; each profile concludes with a brief
authorial comment. Secondly, conceptions of teaching and learning are
categorised and compared with existing categories of conceptions. While the
students' conceptions of learning are found to correspond closely to existing
categories, different categories of conceptions of teaching have been identified.
A model of conceptions of teaching is presented in which the categories are
considered to be complementary rather than hierarchical.
This thesis suggests that there is a close link between students' conceptions of
learning and their approaches to teaching; that prior educational experiences,
especially the influence of significant teachers, has a strong and lasting impact
on students' ideas about teaching and learning; that these ideas undergo
modification rather than substantial change as a result of pre-service teacher
education; that time constraints and the teaching approaches of some associate
teachers in schools may encourage students to adopt teaching methods which
encourage surface approaches to learning in their pupils; and that effective
teaching should draw on all three categories of conceptions of teaching
presented in the model.",,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/3747",,,,"en",,,,,"University of Canterbury.

"4235","10092/806",,,"Bell, Janice Raewyn",,,,,,,,"2007",,,"Numerous educational researchers have stressed the importance of children
learning to read. Achieving well in the New Zealand educational system
depends on a range of factors that are closely linked to the ability to read
effectively. Research has found that children who experience difficulties in
learning to read in the first years of schooling often face failure throughout
their school years and in adulthood. This in turn can restrict job opportunities
and make it more difficult to participate or benefit economically in society.
The aim of this study was to explore the perceptions of reading by
underachieving Year five and six students in a low decile New Zealand
Primary School. The study sought to understand what supports or barriers these
students' encountered in their acquisition of reading skills and how their views
may inform current school and home practices for more effective literacy
learning. The data gathered was shared with one of the participant's parents.
Little has yet been reported on this topic from the point of view of the learner.
This study was designed to hear their views and to see what they saw as
important in learning to read. The researcher used semi-structured focus group
interviews to determine the children's perceptions about how they learned to
read.
Learning to read is complex and a child's understanding of how they learn to
read is also multifaceted. The study concluded that children viewed their
parents or whanau as very influential in their achievement in learning to read.
The views expressed by the children and the parents reinforced the importance
of the home environment's relationship with the school. Parents play an
integral in the fostering of children's literacy development. It is important that
parents are aware of the critical role they play in their child's education because
as the study found children learn to read more effectively with the support of
their whanau.

Teachers also playa vital role in recognising the importance of reading and
preparing all students no matter what their proficiency for literacy learning. It is
the day to day work of educators that ensures the majority of children will learn
to read. The participants in this study did not appear to understand that they
were working below their expected levels in reading. They were aware of some
of the factors that were necessary in learning to read but these had not been
explicit. Teachers need to share this information with students. Students need to
be taught the skills and explicit strategies that allow and encourage them to
persevere, succeed and take control of their own learning to read.",,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/3753",,,,"en",,,,,"University of Canterbury.

"4453","10092/806",,,"Smart, Rosemary Frances",,,,,,,,"1977",,,"The possibility that teacher, classroom and school
factors were involved in the differential educational
placement of low IQ children in regular or special classes
for mildly retarded children was examined. The subjects
were 48 seven and eight year old children with IQs in the
50-80 range. Sixteen of the children (7 girls and 9 boys)
attended regular classes and had never been referred to the
School Psychological Service (N-R); 16 children (9 boys and
7 girls) had remained in regular classes after referral to
the School Psychological Service (R-SC); and 16 children
(9 boys and 7 girls) had been transferred to special
classes in the six months prior to the investigation (S-C).
Two studies were under-taken. Study 1 involved a comparison
of N-R and S-C groups, and Study 2 involved a comparison of
N-R and R-SC groups, and of R-SC and S-C groups.
Questionnaires were administered to the class teachers,
principals and supervisors of junior classes (STJCs) of the
N-R children, and to the class teachers, principals and
STJCs of R-SC and S-C children at the time of their referral
to the Psychological Service.
Teachers of N-R children, in comparison with S-C
teachers, showed higher ratings of their personal/situational
competence to accommodate low ability children, reported a
higher proportion of low achievers in their classes, rated
the subjects in their classes more highly in terms of
personal adequacy, and more N-R teachers than S-C teachers were married (Study 1). In Study 2, N-R teachers also
showed higher ratings on these measures than R-SC teachers,
and R-SC teachers tended to show higher ratings than
S-C teachers. Neither the N-R vs., R-SC nor the R-SC vs.,
S-C differences were significant, however. The STJCs of
N-R children believed more strongly than the STJCs of
S-C children that low IQ children in regular classes impede
the progress of other children, and that STJC/principal
support enables teachers to cope adequately with low IQ
children in regular classes (Study 1). Similar differences
were apparent in Study 2 with N-R STJCs showing stronger
beliefs than R-SC STJCs, and R-SC STJCs stronger beliefs
than S-C STJCs. Neither of these comparisons yielded
significant differences, however. At the same time, the
STJCs of R-SC boys believed more strongly than the STJCs
of S-C boys that the support provided by the Psychological
Service enables teachers to cope adequately with low IQ
children in regular classes, that low IQ children do not
place undue demands on the teachers' time and that the
presence of low IQ children in a regular class does not
impede the progress of other children. The principals'
beliefs regarding special class/mainstreaming did not
differentiate the groups in either study.
It was concluded that teacher, class and school
characteristics are involved in the differential
educational decisions involving low IQ children, and in
particular in the decision of whether or not a child is
transferred to a special class. The results were discussed
in relation to the mainstreaming versus special class issue
and the methodological problems encountered.",,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/3996",,,,"en",,,,,"University of Canterbury.

"4347","10092/806",,,"Allan, Janet K",,,,,,,,"2002",,,"The aim of this research is to explore the question of how farmers learn, in constructing
knowledge both in and for practice. It seeks to identify how they gain new ideas, make
changes, develop to a level of expertise and who and what contribute to this process.
The rapidity of change in a high tech environment, combined with globalisation, the
new economy and the knowledge age, means that farmers are living their lives in 'fast
forward' mode. There is so much new technology, research and development available
that the ability to identify information relevant to a particular farming practice and to
process it to knowledge is an increasing challenge.
Six central South Island (N.Z.) farmers were selected purposively as case studies. The
range of case profiles provides for comparison and contrast of the relative importance of
formal qualifications, differences between sheep/beef farmers and dairy farmers, levels
of expertise, age and experiences. The self-rating of the farmers enables a comparison
of lower and higher performers, identifying characteristics which enable insight into
why some farmers consistently lead new practice and why others are reluctant
followers.
The research is qualitative in design and approached from a constructlVIst and
interpretive paradigm. Socially and experientially based, it seeks to understand the
experiences of the subjects through in-depth interviews and observations.
This study identifies farmers as social learners although working independently, in
relative geographical isolation and often, social isolation. It concludes that these
farmers learn through participation in the practice of farming. This practice includes a
constellation of cOmInunities of practice, which may be resource-rich or resource-poor,
depending on the range and depth of the farmer's involvement. Through full and
committed participation in these practice communities and associate constellations, the
practitioner's identity evolves, encouraging new practices, ideas and innovation. This
study emphasises that expertise is not a permanent state but requires evolving identity,
knowledge and dispositional ability; for maintenance and growth within a culture of
practice.
Emergent grounded theory suggests that dispositional knowledge underpins
construction and use of all knowledge; that construction and use of high-order
propositional and procedural knowledge requires higher-order dispositional knowledge
and that mastery is developed through evolving identity, dispositions, leadership and
learning, socioculturally constructed through resource-rich constellations of
communities of practice.",,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/3867",,,,"en",,,,,"University of Canterbury.

"4293","10092/806",,,"Buckley-Foster, Philippa",,,,,,,,"2005",,,"What influences the evolution of junior school reading programmes in the classrooms of
beginning teachers?
Of all the classroom skills required of beginning teachers, those contributing to the
implementation of an effective instructional reading programme perhaps represent some
of the most complex and sophisticated challenges that will be encountered. Add to this
the critical importance to young children of successfully learning to read and the very
obvious picture of reading progress revealed by modern assessment practices, and the
result is an aspect of teaching that can assume a position of significant focus. This is
especially true for teachers working with junior school children.
This study investigated the current practices of three junior school teachers during their
first two years teaching, how these practices have evolved over time and identifies the
factors that have influenced each teacher. Participants' stories were gathered during
individual interviews to establish current practices and these were compared with a
typical sample of classroom reading instruction that had been captured on video prior to
the initial interviews. Each teacher also participated in an individual follow up interview
during which they were able to observe the sample video excerpt and comment
reflectively upon their practice in the light of their observations.
This study found that developing effective junior school reading programmes generated
considerable angst for these beginning teachers. While they were able to draw upon preservice
preparation when articulating their intentions, the transition from the abstractions
of theory to the realities of classroom practice challenged their teaching skills in this
fledgling stage of their career. Despite an apparent commitment to guided reading as
emphasized in pre-service literacy courses, each participant implemented round robin
reading as their initial teaching strategy. In order to implement reading pedagogy as
advocated within their pre-service experiences, the emergence of a professional
conscience appears to have been critical.
The way that teachers' understanding of literacy acquisition consolidates is greatly
influenced by their practical classroom experiences and the personal capacity that they
bring to the teaching role. The findings of this study support Berliner (1994) and
Huberman (1989) because each of the teachers could be placed on a trajectory of teacher
development. However stage related views of professional development do not fully
reflect the complexity of individuals combined with the uniqueness of their contexts. The
broader perspective highlighted in the work of Nias (1989) provided a framework more
accommodating of the realities encountered during this study.",,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/3799",,,,"en",,,,,"University of Canterbury.

"4329","10092/806",,,,"Couch, Michael Peter",,,,,,,"2004",,,"Ever since Socrates walked the agora of classical Athens, philosophy has involved thinking skills. Philosophy was a core part of education until the industrial revolution shifted the educational context towards specific skills/knowledge.

Although the current secondary curriculum in New Zealand constantly refers to building critical thinking skills, it is narrowly channelling curiosity due to its orientation to content and outcomes. International recognition of the educational benefits of philosophy started principally in select United States primary classrooms in the 1970s. Philosophy has since spread into many secondary school curricula, with particular success in Ontario and Australia.

There has been limited research in New Zealand in this area, and no equivalent call for or against a specific development of philosophy in the curriculum. International literature and educational research into philosophy in the classroom complement literature reviews and comparative studies, all grounded within an historical framework. A case study of Hagley Community College demonstrates the successful introduction of philosophy, while a consideration of psychological research indicates that it can support or oppose philosophy. 

Local research, based on ideas and opinions of students, teachers and lecturers, adds to the understanding of the support and challenges within the New Zealand educational environment. Questionnaire-based exploratory studies give a range of results that show student support for thinking skills and provide a range of responses that should both concern and encourage curriculum developers. 

Analysis of the historical and contemporary educational frameworks leads to the conclusion that philosophy has a viable role within New Zealand schools, and that there is extensive support for philosophy.

"18291","10092/806",,,"Davies, Lorna D.",,,,,,,,"2017",,,"The global discourse around sustainability in healthcare has increased exponentially in the recent years. Sustainable healthcare has been defined as the long-term maintenance of health and wellbeing of the human population. However, there is a paucity of research around midwifery as a sustainable practice.

Using a qualitative research approach, I set out to establish what ‘sustainability’, in its broadest sense, meant to three groups of midwives practicing in the South Island of New Zealand. My aim was to define the term in relation to midwifery practice within the context of a caseload model and to determine whether sustainability was embraced as a concept of value in their work.

Within a series of focus groups, over a fourteen month period, using participatory action research as my methodological framework, I worked with purposefully selected midwives who represented a broad range of practice experience. Actor Network Theory (ANT) was used as a theoretical framework and analytical tool that enabled access to the networks via historical sources and from the data generated from the study.

Analysis of the data indicated that the midwives had an understanding of the tenets of environmental, economic and social sustainability and were able to relate the significance of these elements to their practice. However, their primary focus was on sustainability within the context of professionalism. Further analysis using ANT revealed a number of barriers that the midwives perceived as challenges to the sustainability of their professional identity and prohibited them from engaging with the broader tenets of sustainability within midwifery practice. It transpired that the hegemony of neoliberalism was instrumental in undermining the values of sustainability within the NZ midwifery context.

Neoliberalism makes its presence felt in multiple ways within the network, for instance in the concept of consumerism, in the materiality status of technology, in the semiotic nature of the nostalgia expressed by the midwives, and in the professional issues identified. These elements demonstrate that the barriers that impact on the professional identity of the midwives generate a ‘siege’ mentality, and it can be concluded that they prevent the midwives from engaging with the concept of sustainability in their practice.",,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/14670",,,,"en","English",,,,"University of Canterbury",,,,,,,"http://library.canterbury.ac.nz/thesis/etheses_copyright.shtml","All Rights Reserved",,,,,,,,,,,,"Midwifery: a model of sustainable healthcare practice?",,,"Electronic Thesis or Dissertation",,,,"University of Canterbury",,"Doctoral",,,"Doctor of Philosophy",,,,,"College of Education, Health and Human Development, University of Canterbury",,"lornamidwife@hotmail.com",,,,,,,,,"Dr David Small"

and students make about their next school? The writer's experience as a past
contributing primary school principal and a current intermediate school
principal would suggest that the comments a teacher or principal makes about a
another school may influence parents and students in their selection of their
'next' school.
The study seeks to explore contributing school staff perceptions about the
school/s they contribute to, their knowledge about the school/s, how they gain
knowledge about the school/s, and the frequency they provide advice on school
selection to parents or students. A key element of the study is the focus on the
perceptions held by contributing school staff of the schools to which their
school contributes. The New Zealand school system is an increasingly
competitive school environment.
New Zealand compulsory education is relatively fragmented with a wide range
of schools being present within a self-managing framework overseen by a
central Ministry of Education. Each school delivers individually tailored
learning programmes based on a nationally mandated curriculum. This has
resulted in a system of schooling that is inherently competitive and where
parents have considerable choice about which schools their child may attend
although enrolment zones or enrolment criteria can at times restrict this choice.
The result of this environment is that many schools have to engage in both
direct and indirect marketing to ensure their survival. This marketing may
include a range of activities including open nights, community newsletters, a
glossy school prospectus, or newspaper advertising. Contributing schools often
act as information gatekeepers to prospective students and families,
interpreting, allowing or not allowing information to pass on to students
therefore the perceptions that contributing school staff have about a school may
influence the advice they give or the access to students that they allow.
A written survey was provided to all staff at three contributing schools. All
three schools contributed to the same two intermediate schools. The survey
contained multiple-choice questions, with a small number of open-ended
questions.
Staff in the case study schools showed little factual knowledge about the
schools to which they contributed. The majority of staff felt they had no views
for or against particular schools, nor were they asked directly for information
about the 'next school' very often.
The writer identifies an area for further study, suggesting a study involving
Year 6 students, parents of year 6 students, contributing school staff and staff at
the next school. This study would seek to compare the sources and type of
information students and parents had about 'next school' selection and the
influences contributing school staff may have on the type or content of
information available.",,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/4051",,,,"en",,,,,"University of Canterbury.

"4332","10092/806",,,"Jacques, Anne Roberta",,,,,,,,"2009",,,"With a new national curriculum, the New Zealand Ministry of Education has created a new learning area – Learning Languages. From 2010 all schools will have to show they are moving towards providing programmes for language learning for all students from Years 7 to 10. In preparation for this, primary and intermediate schools have been increasingly offering diverse programmes of language learning to their students, and high school language teachers have noticed an increase in knowledge and experience from their Year 9 entrants to language classes. This gives rise to the question of how teachers at high schools are able to manage language classes where students have a very diverse range of experiences of learning another language. 

This study is a case study from one high school on the phenomenon of language learning, as experienced and explained by nine Year 9 students. The students are asked to explore their current and previous language learning experiences in group interviews, and especially to discuss the issues which they have found in their classes.

The students are from diverse backgrounds, with different experiences of learning another language. Their discussion is honest and wide-ranging as they talk about their experiences, giving reasons for their language choice, and explaining what they like and don’t like about their learning. They offer opinions on co-operative learning, mixed-level classes and the difficulties and benefits of learning another language and they make suggestions about what helps them learn best. A recurring theme in their discussion is one of relationships – family connections which may make a particular language more attractive, teacher-pupil relationships which foster learning, and, more especially, the peer-relationships which support (or occasionally inhibit) learning, and provide social support and a social network of friends. Overwhelmingly, they say they would rather study with their friends in a mixed-level class, than learn in a class which is streamed to their own level. Analysis of data further reveals that identity negotiations, which may not be recognised by the students themselves, play a part in the learning process.

The study concludes with recommendations for practice and pedagogy, based on the students’ conversations. The four recommendations are about diversity – exploring the extent of diversity in the classroom, creating an environment which supports diversity, creating programmes which allow diverse students to learn together and creating opportunities for them to learn from each other.",,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/3833",,,,"en",,,,,"University of Canterbury.

"4371","10092/806",,,"Dabner, Nicola Jeanne",,,,,,,,"2010",,,"This study explores one aspect of the professional preparation of students graduating from teacher education institutions. A case study of one of the University of Canterbury College of Education’s initial teacher education programmes (the BTchLn (Primary) qualification) is the focus for this study. The purpose of the study is to illustrate what school employers from the Canterbury region, and BTchLn (Primary) graduates and teacher educators from the University of Canterbury, consider as important practices when preparing graduating-year students for the beginning-teacher employment process. This study addresses the lack of systematic research into the employment of beginning teachers within a New Zealand setting.

The study employs a case study approach and involves two stages of data gathering. Quantitative data is collected in Stage One to identify potential participants for the case study. More substantive qualitative data are collected in Stage Two through semi-structured interviews conducted with samples of school principals, graduates and initial teacher education lecturers from the Canterbury region.

The findings suggest that the decentralised system of employment in operation in New Zealand has made the employment process complex for teachers entering the profession because schools have developed their own individual practices and preferences in the employment-related area and advertise their beginning-teacher positions while students are still completing their programme of study. The findings also suggest that lecturers at the University of Canterbury perform an important and valued function when they prepare their graduating-year students for employment, although there are both strengths and weaknesses in their current employment-related programme and practices. This case study will inform course and qualification reviews planned at the University of Canterbury, and will be of interest to other teacher education organisations in New Zealand that prepare their graduating-year students for employment.",,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/3924",,,,"en",,,,,"University of Canterbury.

"4108","10092/806",,,"Lim, Elena Lynn Pei",,,,,,,,"2009",,,"Lead (Pb) is a known toxicant that affects young children. It is believed that old water reticulation systems are prone to lead leaching from the walls of lead pipes and fixtures where water is conveyed to households. Many households in Christchurch city particularly in the Northwestern and Central parts of the city contain old water reticulation systems thereby, putting children at considerable health risks. The purpose of this dissertation is to identify the hazards of lead exposure that comes from old water reticulation system of Northwest (NW) Christchurch water supply to households, characterize the health risks due to such contamination and, finally, to suggest possible ways to minimize the hazards. This is accomplished by conducting a systematic review of literature on the exposure patterns of lead from reticulation systems and a literature review of the possible dose response patterns of health effects of lead contamination from old water reticulation systems on children.  Thus, this dissertation involves a literature based risk assessment of lead contamination of drinking water supply in the Northwest Christchurch Zone and particularly, its effects on young children. The selection process of the research studies is based on whether they offer accurate and suitable information on the risk of adverse mental function in infants and young children due to environmental lead exposure; whether the studies have been peer reviewed by qualified scientists; whether the results are confirmed by other studies; and involves only human subjects. Future research may consider whether lead levels in drinking water are seasonal; whether these values are significant to health or, the possible role of the government in tightening product controls when monitoring the availability and health risk of high lead drinking water supply plumbing products available in the New Zealand market.",,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/3701",,,,"en",,,,,"University of Canterbury.

This piece of research examines the incorporation of the gifted learning model Operation Houndstooth within the setting of a primary school environmental programme in order to meet the learning needs of a group emotionally gifted students. The project was initiated after observing the capacity of the New Zealand Enviro Schools programme as a learning vehicle to allow this group of gifted learners the opportunity to participate in a problem solving process within the Operation Houndstooth model. Houndstooth itself derives from the Enrichment Triad Model for learning and is the work of the American educational psychologist Joseph Renzulli. The Houndstooth model has been designed to extend the co-cognitive skills of each gifted learner.

The programme itself was conducted within a primary school environment in which the researcher was employed as a teacher and the participants were members of the senior classes. The research was carried out as a qualitative study with a single-case study placed alongside action research. The completion of the project saw the emergence of a group of students who had developed their confidence as efficient communicators and capable problem solvers. The study argues for the development of gifted programmes that recognise emotional giftedness within the New Zealand primary school setting which incorporates Renzulli’s Houndstooth as a delivery model.",,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/8927",,,,"en",,,,,"University of Canterbury.

"4952","10092/806",,,"Thorn, Sandra Anne",,,,,,,,"2010",,,"As a physical education teacher educator and Olympic educator I have become conscious that many physical education teachers have heard of Olympism, but are confused about what it encompasses. Furthermore they are challenged to understand how to teach Olympism in their physical education programmes. The potential of the educative and social value of Olympism is, as yet, unfulfilled. My study is about the content knowledge teachers require for teaching Olympism, the successful pedagogies they use, and the meanings that students derive from putting Olympism into action within, and outside of, the gymnasium.
My qualitative case study uses teacher and student interviews, and observations to gather data as it follows the teaching and learning of Olympism in the Year 9 physical education programme of a New Zealand secondary school. In my attempt to understand what teachers need to know and do to make Olympism a reality in physical education programmes I have drawn on aspects of Shulman‟s (1987) seminal framework of teacher knowledge, to understand the content knowledge needed for teaching Olympism, the pedagogical content knowledge required, and the knowledge of students and their characteristics as they learn about Olympism.
My findings reveal that teachers require various forms of content knowledge to teach Olympism, such as knowledge of students and their needs, a clear definition of Olympism for the setting, Olympism as a personal life-stance, ethical situations in games, and a holistic physical education curriculum. Pedagogies that the teachers used were found to be the transformation of Olympism into manageable concepts for teaching, the use of experiential and social teaching models in games contexts, and the extensive use of questioning and discussion strategies to develop critical thinking. Evidence shows the range of the students‟ learning, and the development of deeper meanings of Olympism. The students regarded the teacher as a role model of Olympism, and varied in their ability to transfer Olympism understandings into their wider lives.
My detailed account of how teachers understand and teach Olympism, and the extent to which students apply their knowledge in class and beyond, offers a practical example of what Olympic education can look like when it has Olympism at its core. Such teaching I have named Olympism education.",,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/4537",,,,"en",,,,,"University of Canterbury.

However, the learning area of health and physical education (HPE) -previously called- physical education and sports (PES) has seen some radical reforms over the past 30 years. These reforms transformed the core objectives of PES, and the role of schools in promoting PA.

The aim of this study is to examine the discrepancy between the essential role that is attributed to HPE in the promotion of active lifestyles (Ministry of Education, 2007) and the decreasing numbers of senior secondary school students participating in extra-curricular physical activities (ECPA) (New Zealand Secondary School Council, 2010; Adolescent Health Research Group, 2001, 2008, 2012).

The relationship between what students do in HPE and what they carry over into their lifestyles is yet to be adequately investigated (Yelling et al., 2000.; Telema et al., 2005.; Shen et al., 2007; Haerens et al., 2009; Walhead et al., 20010;). Findings from this study could contribute to broadening the debate amongst both academics and practitioners about the relationship between HPE and ECPA and to enhancing their interventions.

Mixed research methods were used to collect data for this study. First a survey was conducted to gather demographic information about 162 year 12 students from five different high schools. This was followed by interviewing four individual students, four groups of students, and four heads of HPE departments about their perceptions of the 2007 HPE curriculum (2007 HPEC). Findings from this study indicate that it is very difficult to measure whether the core objective of leading students into active lifestyles is achieved or not. More research is needed into the reasons why students pursue PA in New Zealand and how it is possible to maintain their participation at the health recommended levels.",,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/14684",,,,"en","English",,,,"University of Canterbury",,,,,,,"http://library.canterbury.ac.nz/thesis/etheses_copyright.shtml","All Rights Reserved",,,,,,,,,,,,"An Investigation into the Influence of the HPE Curriculum on the Participation of Year 12 Students in Extra-Curricular Physical Activity",,,"Electronic Thesis or Dissertation",,,"Education","University of Canterbury",,"Doctoral",,,"Doctor of Philosophy",,,"2578434",,"College of Education, Health and Human Development, University of Canterbury",,"mouutrib3@hotmail.com",,,,,,,,,"Dr William O'Steen"
"18321","10092/806",,,"Blackney, Russell T.",,,,,,,,"2017",,,"The health and wellbeing benefits that result from exposure to natural environments through various outdoor recreational activities are the subject of ongoing investigation. Within the resulting interdisciplinary literature, the impact of specific outdoor recreational activities for men’s health and wellbeing is less well understood. This research examined the experiences of men who enjoy fishing and/or tramping in the New Zealand outdoor environments, and the role that these outdoor activities fulfilled in their lives.

A qualitative descriptive approach using semi-structured interviews and open-ended questions was used to document the experiences of 10 men who undertook tramping or fishing excursions on a regular basis. A thematic analysis approach identified five key themes in their responses. Participants experienced health-related benefits across the physical, mental/psychological, social, personal development, and self-actualization domains. The reduction of stress was a prominent experience for all participants. In addition, the early life influence of fathers, families, close friends, schools, and youth group programmes was found to be instrumental in men developing committed and enduring healthy attitudes to natural environments, and to their pursuit of outdoor recreational activities.

There are ample opportunities for further research into the significance of outdoor recreation in natural environments for men’s health in New Zealand.
Such research might employ longitudinal approaches to measure the permanence of improved health and wellbeing outcomes for men who regularly participate in specific outdoor recreational activities (e.g. camping, tramping, fishing, hunting, biking, diving, skydiving, water skiing and canoeing/kayaking). The accessibility and affordability of outdoor recreation for men warrants further investigation, particularly for men from lower socio-economic households, minority ethnic groups, and those with disabilities. Future research might also investigate the significance of regular early life exposure to outdoor recreational activities for the health and wellbeing of male teenagers, and whether any positive effects of early life exposure might transfer into adulthood. Research in these and related areas has the potential to deepen our understanding of the role that regular participation in outdoor recreational activities in natural environments can play for men’s health and wellbeing.",,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/14682",,,,"en","English",,,,"University of Canterbury",,,,,,,"http://library.canterbury.ac.nz/thesis/etheses_copyright.shtml","All Rights Reserved",,,,,,,,,,,,"Men’s experiences of outdoor recreation in New Zealand",,,"Electronic Thesis or Dissertation",,,"Health Sciences","University of Canterbury",,"Masters",,,"Master of Health Sciences",,,"2578429",,"College of Education, Health and Human Development, University of Canterbury",,"russell.t.blackney@gmail.com",,,,,,,,,"Associate Professor David Conradson"

"2528","10092/806",,,"Winkworth, Elizabeth",,,,,,,,"1988",,,"This study set out to investigate the quality of educational
provisions for Children with Special Abilities in a rural
area of New Zealand.
The West Coast of the South Island is a relatively isolated
area characterized by small rural communities separated
by long distances. Difficulties are experienced in travel
and communication with some parts of the area receiving
limited radio and television reception.
Schools are predominantly small, 50% being one-two teacher
schools. The area is administered by two different education
boards. Staff turnover is high and teacher qualifications
are lower than the national average.
A survey was carried out asking principals of West Coast
schools catering for primary levels to nominate children
with special abilities in their schools. Questionnaires
were then sent to the parents and to the children themselves.
A small group of experienced teachers was interviewed
in order to gain further in-depth information on
teachers' knowledge of and attitudes to children with
special abilities.
It was found that children with Special Abilities were
taught almost exclusively within their own schools. There were no withdrawal programmes available, transport
costs limited schools' ability to travel or to obtain
resources, mentors were not used to help cater for Children
with Special Abilities and the resources of the Correspondence
School Individual Programming Section were used by few
schools.
Teachers demonstrated a lack of confidence in their ability
to identify and cater for Children with Special Abilities.
Very few had received either preservice or inservice training
in this area. They were further unfamiliar with the range
of suggested identification procedures currently espoused
by the Department of Education. Children who were identified
from the survey were predominantly those demonstrating
one or more areas of high achievement at school. The majority
were also well-adjusted children who enjoyed school.
Data from teachers and parents showed that there was a
high level of agreement that children nominated were of
high ability. However, while parents were very involved
in assisting in their children's schools, their contribution
was at an organisational level and none had been asked
to assist in programmes to cater for children with special
abilities.
The difficulties experienced by West Coast teachers in
catering for their Children with Special Abilities are discussed in relation to the present 'mainstreaming' emphasis
followed by the Department of Education and the paucity
of resources provided. Implications for educational policy
and for further research are examined.",,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/2168",,,,"en",,,,,"University of Canterbury.

suitability of reference tests for moderating internally
assessed national qualifications at the upper secondary school
level. In a secondary analysis, the relative merits of two
alternative item formats, the open-ended and cloze, were
compared with the multiple-choice item, which has been traditionally
utilized in reference tests of this nature.
A series of short reference tests, based on the underlying
construct of developed abilities, were constructed in four core
subject areas (i.e. English, mathematics, science and social
studies), along with an additional test of scholastic aptitude.
The English, science and social studies tests consisted of a
vocabulary and reading comprehension component; while the
mathematics test had a more traditional content, relating to
the measure of general concepts. An essay test was added to the
English test analyses. Multiple forms of the developed abilities
tests were developed as separate multiple-choice and open-ended/
cloze formats, and to enable a multiple matrix sampling technique
to be employed.
The validity of the reference tests was evaluated by using
the performance of Christchurch fifth formers on the tests to predict
their corresponding School Certificate Examination class parameters
(i.e. mean and standard deviation). These analyses were based on
a sample of 18 classes, across four state, co-educational high
schools; covering a wide range of ability levels. A series of
mUltiple regression analyses were conducted to provide optimal
predictions of the respective class parameters.
It was found that each of the subject-based reference tests
predicted class ability levels (i.e. means) on the corresponding
School Certificate Examinations with a very high degree of
sensitivity. The multiple-R's generated were 0.97 for mathematics,
0.90 for English, 0.89 for science and 0.80 for social studies.
The predictions of the spread of ability for each class (i.e.
standard deviation) were found to be more difficult, although
the results were still sensitive enough for moderation purposes.
The addition of the mathematics or scholastic aptitude
test to the subject-based reference tests improved the multiple-R's
on both parameters.
The comparison of item types revealed no significant difference
in the prediction of class means. However, the open-ended/
cloze format failed to predict class standard deviations at a
statistically significant level.
The findings were discussed with reference to those
from earlier studies, to policy implications, to application at
a practical level and to the urgent need for further research.",,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/3497",,,,"en",,,,,"University of Canterbury.

a study was undertaken in fourteen Christchurch state secondary
schools to examine the nature, incidence, correlates,
etiology and treatment of 'difficult' behaviour. Classroom
teachers, senior staff, and 'difficult' as well as well-behaved
pupils contributed their perceptions of the problem.
The main research methods were rating scales and structured
interviews. Teachers nominated 210 pupils (116 boys and 94 girls)
(2.6% of the combined secondary school rolls) as so difficult
that they needed help to cope with them. Lower socio-economic
levels, Non-Europeans, children from larger families or solo
parent homes and children of lower scholastic aptitude were
over-represented. Persistent defiance and behaviours which
interfered with learning were the teachers' main concerns.
Sex, race, scholastic aptitude, and type of school proved
to be significant classificatory variables. Males, Non-Europeans,
those of low scholastic aptitude and those from
co-educational schools tended to engage more frequently in
the more blatantly anti-social misbehaviours. Sex interacted
with race, with Non-European females tending to smoke, flout
uniform regulations and use obscene language more frequently
than other groups.
While senior teachers saw family factors as important they
also acknowledged the contribution of the school curriculum and
organization. The most favoured solution was improved staffing
ratios to allow greater flexibility in providing for difficult
pupils within the school.
Difficult pupils were rated significantly lower in social
development and self-esteem than controls. However there was
considerable overlap in the pupils' self-descriptions, reported
perceptions of the opinion held of them by significant
others, definition of problem behaviour and suggested solutions.
In spite of this more of the difficult pupils
regarded themselves, and saw those in authority regarding
them, negatively. Their misbehaviours constituted challenges
to authority rather than being schoolwork-related. Both
groups saw the responsibility for control lying primarily with
teachers. A third of the difficult pupils expressed a desire
to change their attitudes and behaviour at school and to
achieve better family communication.",,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/3495",,,,"en",,,,,"University of Canterbury.

Wairuatanga permeated through the life and teaching of the participants who all expressed their
own sense of wairuatanga in different ways. The cognisance of mātauranga Māori, tikanga
Māori and insights into te ao Māori were identified and explored thus taking into account the
various ways in which the three participants extended the parameters of existing knowledge of
wairuatanga and how they promoted and created a climate within their own teaching context that
fostered the natural inclusion of wairuatanga. The findings will assist current teachers and
others to develop an understanding and appreciation of the different forms of wairuatanga that
may assist them to apply this value to their own classroom practice. It is hoped that the findings

"4545","10092/806",,,"Cairns, Carolyn Jane",,,,,,,,"2010",,,"This thesis explores the professional practice of two highly accomplished expert teachers, ‘masters’ of classical ballet, with the aim of providing an understanding of their expertise.
A qualitative case study methodology was used to illuminate the masters’ knowledge acquisition and teaching practices. Data collection comprised interviews with the masters and a sample of their students, and teaching observations of the masters at work. 
A metaphoric conceptual framework of a three-act ballet performance has been used to present the thesis. This dance-related metaphor was chosen: firstly, because it keeps the ballet context in focus; secondly, because it allows for the leading roles to be those of the masters, and their students, and; thirdly because it provides a fitting way to highlight key themes that emerged from the data analysis. Furthermore, just as an entire three-act ballet needs to be experienced in order to fully understand its story, so too, all three acts of the thesis ‘performance’ must be read in order to appreciate the complexity and inter-connected nature of the masters’ practice.  

Part One (The Programme) provides the foundation work of the thesis (introduction, literature review, methodology, and methods). Part Two includes The Performance, with the Prologue presenting biographic narratives for both masters and each of the three acts revealing key dimensions of the masters’ practice. Act One explores their knowledge acquisition, professional philosophies and beliefs. Act Two explores their professional orientations. Act Three illuminates their expertise in action, within the class and rehearsal environment. Important themes include the recognition that, for the masters, learning and teaching develop over a lifetime and are inspired by an immense passion and dedication for ballet and its teaching. Also, a master brings to the art- form his/her own individuality, and creativity, and actively contributes to ballet’s historical continuum through his/her professional legacy of practice. While some of the findings support aspects already described in the literature about expertise, the use of a domain-specific case study establishes this support, and illuminates a new perspective with much needed evidence.

A Grand Finale concludes the study, with the development of a prototypical view of the professional practice of a classical ballet master. Such a prototype has the potential to inform researchers of exemplary practice in other art forms, and more importantly, to highlight the essential characteristics of exemplary ballet masters.",,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/4052",,,,"en",,,,,"University of Canterbury.

"3234","10092/806",,,"McDowell, Craig R.",,,,,,,,"2004",,,"This study investigated exemplary teachers' perspectives on performance in order to
understand the complex human interactions that constituted teaching and learning of the
highest order. Theories explaining the complex nature of teacher excellence remain
limited. The purpose of this study was to shed some light on the notion of performance
from the perspective of exemplary teachers and answer key research questions: what are
exemplary teachers' perspectives on the notion of performance, and how do exemplary
teachers enact these perspectives?
The use of a case study research design allowed for a number of methods to be used to
explore the topic. Five teachers that had received National Excellence in Teaching
Awards were interviewed and observed. Two were videoed, and a group interview
concluded the data generation phase. Qualitative methodology was used to allow the
participants to describe, in their own context, how they perceived performance and to
provide further insight into the richness, complexity and range of teacher attitudes and
values. Perspectives revealed there was no single way of understanding performance;
rather this was determined to some extent by participants' worldview. The
phenomenological research approach used allowed participants to describe their
perspectives on performance in an open and enlightened way, thus successfully gaining
entry into their conceptual world.
The perspectives of exemplary teachers in this study revealed four key conceptual
themes as being relevant to the notion of performance: relationships and influences,
self-concept, reflection and renewal, and performance expectations. Prominent amongst
these findings was the conclusion that these teachers had an overwhelming passion for
learning and excellence in terms of expectations for themselves and the students they
taught, an ability to reflect in a self-critical and natural way, a genuine desire to interact
and engage with people, and above all, a caring disposition towards people and their
performance. These teachers saw themselves as learners, continuously developing, and
through a strong self-belief, changing as their knowledge changed. How and why they
made decisions was closely linked to their beliefs, assumptions and dispositions they
held. Participants' perspectives indicated that high performance expectations relied on
the relationship between these beliefs and attitudes, and students' achieving well, not
only academically, but also first and foremost, in all aspects of being a person.
Exemplary teachers in this study wanted to motivate students for life, to show their real
talent and potential.
In this study, exemplary teachers' perspectives on performance showed that they were
emotionally committed to learn, motivated, and through thinking and accessing
information in a variety of ways, were prepared to learn in a worldly way. They were
passionate about choosing to use their ability and skills to make learning exciting and
interesting for students in the context that they perceived students and society expected.
These exemplary teachers saw it as their moral responsibility to serve society, to fulfil a
need. What made a teaching activity so special for the exemplary teachers in this study
was the feeling they got from the activity itself. They had taken charge of their
conscious experiences and inner life.",,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/2846",,,,"en",,,,,"University of Canterbury.

"4786","10092/806",,,"Boyask, Ruth",,,,,,,,"2003",,,"As the title of this thesis suggests, this is a project of salvaging practice from the site of 20th
century art education in New Zealand, engaged in through research practice and its materialisation
into text. Through exploring this site I ask what makes art useful to educational practice,
using the voice of an embodied artist/researcher? The 20th century answers to this question
range from developing a visual literacy that can be applied to the image-saturated world of mass
media to the liberation of human potential through arts-based inquiries. My project includes the
critical interrogation of these positions, contextualised within an argument that value in the
practices of art comes from the contextual and contingent disciplinary understandings of art.
Whilst the predominant logic of the research is founded in a theoretical hybridism of art and
education, using the methodologies of art practice and narrative inquiry, each chapter represents
a different way of thinking about the initial proposition on the value of art practice, using representational
forms that are integral to their epistemologies. In the pursuit of the value of art
practice, I have explored a number of rich art educational contexts. These have included investigating
multiple depictions of the phenomenology of teaching and learning art as well as piecing
together constructions of historical art education practice and the representation of both of these
in academic discourse throughout the 20th century. The complexity of these contexts demands
complex and multidimensional analyses.
The significant findings of this text are the recommendations for recognition of the embodied
nature of art learning, whereby art meanings are actively constructed within thinking and working,
albeit contingent, bodies. This is a position that is undermined by a textualisation of culture
that positions bodies entirely as discursive abstractions, removed from their phenomenological
existence. I find that the re-examination of the significance of material effects to individual
subject bodies re-inserts positions f!om which to speak on the value and ethics of art education,
however, contingent subjectivities mean that an ethical art pedagogy needs careful consideration.
Examining critical and emancipatory practices in art provides a guide for how this may be
achieved.",,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/4314",,,,"en",,,,,"University of Canterbury.

Policies introduced to try to reduce consumption have been relatively ineffective either through the impact of social forces or lack of resources. Another suggested approach is enhanced parental engagement. This research aimed to identify the patterns of and attitudes to alcohol consumption among Sri Lankan adolescents, determine how selected national and local environmental factors are related to consumption and establish relationships between parental engagement and adolescent alcohol use.

As this is a largely un-researched area in Sri Lanka the study used sequential exploratory mixed methods comprising four focus groups (29 participants) followed by a cross-sectional survey of a sample of 15-18 years old students (N=549) randomly selected from Government schools in four urban areas to examine parental engagement and other factors associated with adolescent alcohol use and attitudes. The survey drew on both findings of the focus groups (particularly related to peer influences, reasons for drinking and sources of illegal alcohol) and the international literature.

Approximately 5% of respondents reported drinking alcohol, 4% indicated that it was OK to drink alcohol under 21 years of age and 71% reported seeing others under 21 drinking. While 77% of respondents reported that young people drink alcohol to have fun, nearly as many (71%) reported that young people drink because they are sad and depressed. Of parental engagement types, parental monitoring was the most frequently reported, with parental controlling and communication identified at much lower levels.

This research provided substantial new information on adolescent attitudes to and experience of alcohol consumption, the social context of their drinking and their perspectives on parental engagement. This will be relevant for policy development and improving local and family interventions to reduce alcohol consumption. This research will be of interest to those wanting to see alcohol use within the broader context of adolescent health policy, particularly related to mental health.",,,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/14907",,,"en","English",,,,"University of Canterbury",,,,,,,"http://library.canterbury.ac.nz/thesis/etheses_copyright.shtml","All Rights Reserved",,,,,,,,,,,,"Parental engagement and other factors associated with adolescents alcohol use and attitudes in Sri Lanka",,,"Electronic Thesis or Dissertation",,"Health Sciences",,"University of Canterbury",,"Doctoral",,,"Doctor of Philosophy",,"2586158",,,"College of Education, Health and Human Development, University of Canterbury",,"ythushara@yahoo.com",,,,,,,,,"Dr Arindam Basu"

However, a paucity of research on affective practice in movement has hindered diverse understandings of movement pleasure. This thesis therefore, addresses the research question ‘How is the joy of movement experienced in physical education?’ A traditional hermeneutical interpretation has been used, in place of a traditional methodology, to reveal findings of the ‘enfleshed’ body, the institutionalisation of movement and aberrations of spontaneity and playfulness in physical education. The thesis uses two dance moves, the ‘box step’ and the ‘dab’ to interpret these findings. Epicurean theory is used to understand pleasure and pain, the body and the void, and how ontology plays an important role in the joy of movement. Epicureanism is not just used as a guiding theoretical framework, but as part of the fabric of the thesis. Findings of playfulness, a disruption to performative culture, and a desire for expression in movement for pleasure, have led to a suggestion of a pedagogical framework. This framework aims to challenge institutionalised movement experiences, prioritise ontological structures of understanding, and liberate the ‘self’ from movement oppression. This pedagogy, called Enfleshed pedagogy, would allow a social action of ‘self,’ centred on disrupting the notion of the ‘Other’ in movement, celebrating fleshly difference, and prioritising sense-perception.",,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/14910",,,,"en","English",,,,"University of Canterbury",,,,,,,"http://library.canterbury.ac.nz/thesis/etheses_copyright.shtml","All Rights Reserved",,,,,,,,,,,,"The joy of movement in physical education: the enfleshed body",,,"Electronic Thesis or Dissertation",,,"Health Sciences","University of Canterbury",,"Doctoral",,,"Doctor of Philosophy",,"2586167",,,"College of Education, Health and Human Development, University of Canterbury",,"susierstevens@gmail.com",,,,,,,,,"Professor Ian Culpan"

"4625","10092/806",,,"Davey, Ronys Lee",,,,,,,,"2010",,,"This thesis aims to take a step or two towards a theoretical model of where teacher education ‘stands’ as a social practice, a career, a discipline, and a profession. It does this through the specific lens of ‘professional identity’, a concept often referred to in the teaching and teacher education literature but one that is also often ill-defined and seldom made the empirical focus of the studies reported.
Taking as its starting point a definition of professional identity as ‘the valued professional self’, the thesis recounts the findings of a phenomenological study of the professional self-image and identities of nine preservice teacher educators from six different institutions in Aotearoa New Zealand. The research involved a grounded analysis of the transcripts of some 39 extended interviews with the teacher educators, conducted over a five-year period. 
The period during which the thesis was written has been one of considerable educational change in New Zealand, and one little short of an upheaval in relation to the institutional structuring of teacher education nation-wide. During the period of the study colleges of education with a century and a half of history as independent, stand-alone and specialist institutions, have gone through a complex process of merging with their local universities, while neo-liberal reforms of all tertiary institutions have placed particular strains and constraints on the pedagogical structures and processes that are typically implemented in teacher education programmes. Being on the brink of a new era in teacher education has thus brought teacher educators’ identity - their place in the educational world and what it is that they and their field fundamentally ‘stand for’ - both into relief, and for some, into question.
The teacher educators in the study followed a path into teacher education typical in New Zealand but perhaps increasingly untypical in many other countries - from practitioner to academic - and in one sense it is an account of how they severally and collectively have come to terms with their own identities as professionals during that journey and at a time of considerable institutional turmoil. But the research also attempts to get beyond their individual stories to address broader issues of how one might best ‘get at’ a professional identity in the first place, as a matter of interview analysis and method, whether or not there are some distinctive but common elements that might distinguish the professional identity of the particular group we call teacher educators, and if there are, then what those distinctive characteristics might be.
The research studied the teacher educators’ professional identities through several related lenses or perspectives that taken together might be seen as constituting or covering the key facets of the phenomenon we call a professional identity. It interrogates their storied accounts of how and why they became teacher educators: their professional motivations, goals and career histories. It also examines through a snapshot in time what they saw as the occupational scope of their jobs and the various roles they undertook, and the relative emphasis or value priority given by individuals to each job or role. Through a third lens, it describes and theorises the particular knowledge base(s), pedagogies and professional expertise they felt they needed to do the job effectively, and what they saw as teacher educators’ distinctive ‘expertise’. Using metaphor analysis, it also explores the emotionalities associated with the various personae they found themselves ‘being’ as teacher educators - the highs and things that gave them ‘heart’, along with the tensions, incongruities and dilemmas associated with ‘being’ teacher educators. A final perspective explores their sense of collective identity as a professional community and the various other professional groups with whom they felt more, or less, collective affinity. 
The thesis concludes by proposing a conceptual model of teacher educators’ professional identity as an identity that overlaps with that of teachers in schools as well as with that of academics in other fields, but which is nevertheless distinguishable from both these. In particular, it is simultaneously more multifaceted in scope than the former and more performative in nature than the latter. The study suggests that teacher educators’ professional identity may be particularly characterised by the comprehensiveness of its specialist expertise, by a strong sense of ethical commitment and other-centredness, by a conception of teacher education as the embodied enactment of its own knowledge-base and expertise, and, ultimately, by an abiding ambivalence about teacher educators’ and teacher education’s place in the world - the professional discomfort that characterises working across ‘the spaces in between’.",,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/4146",,,,"en",,,,,"University of Canterbury.

"18405","10092/806",,,"Barraclough, Shanee Joanne",,,,,,,,"2017",,,"Limited research is available which directly investigates the lived experience of counsellors-in-training, and how it shapes both what it means to become a counsellor, and counsellor education. Conceptualisations of this process and related counsellor education are mainly limited to psychological and humanistic models of professional development. As a counsellor educator on a Master of Counselling programme, espousing a social constructionist approach to counselling, I was interested to both study the lived experience of counsellors-in-training and explore the possibilities of theorizing this process beyond the limits of available conceptual frameworks for counsellor education.

This thesis performs ethico-onto-epistemological shifts in relation with the matter, time and space of this project, from primarily post-structural to posthumanist ways of conceptualising the research process and the (post)human subject, along with considering implications of reconfiguring the counsellor-in-training subject for counsellor education. With a focus on mapping and theorizing the experiences of a small, diverse group of counsellors-in-training, I draw on data generated over the period of one year, primarily through the post-structurally informed methodology of collective biography. A shift to a posthumanist analytic focus enabled a move beyond the discursive to a mapping of the multiple, entangled material, affective and discursive force relations enacting the agential possibilities for counsellors-in-training. Engaging in a diffractive, rather than reflexive, process of data analysis, which marks a decentring of the individual subject of inquiry, and instead requires an opening up to the intra-active flows, matter, and material-discursive practices, I document how tears came to matter, both as an object of analysis, and for counsellors-in-training, in relation to the multiple forces enacting them.

Counsellor-in-training (and counsellor-researcher) tears, as both present and ghostly, are conceptualised in Karen Barad’s agential realist terms as material-discursive practices or phenomena (Barad, 2007). Data analysis entails a detailed mapping of tears as phenomena, which makes visible the multiple intra-active forces and encounters enacting them. Such analysis shows not just the complex and intra-active material-discursive forces at work in the materialisation of tears, but through tears, the forces at work then, also in the ongoing and iterative (re)(con)figuring of a counsellor-in-training as posthuman subject. In this way, a counsellor-in-training educative subject is re-imagined as an ethical, vital, moving embodiment of multiple affective-material-discursive relations, an enactment of “unfolding the self onto the world, while enfolding the world within” (Braidotti, 2016, p. 26). Such a re-imagining of this posthuman, educative subject necessarily invites a reconceptualising of (counsellor) education and its pedagogical practices.

This thesis concludes with an initial consideration of the kinds of pedagogical practices and challenges such a post-human re-imagining might produce for counsellor education. In particular, I draw on the posthumanist concepts of emergent listening and diffraction to conceptualise the group process participants engaged in, and reconfigure the posthumanist pedagogical possibilities of a shift from reflective to diffractive practice in counsellor education. Requiring an openness to the not-yet known, diffractive practice as pedagogy invites counsellors-in-training beyond known, habitual, and normative reproductions of identity and practice. I suggest that a collective, diffractive process, where posthumanist notions of entanglement, dynamic relationality, and difference underpin embodied and creative practices of telling and listening, affords both generative and disruptive possibilities for emerging counsellor identities and practices, and for counsellor education.",,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/14927",,,,"en","English",,,,"University of Canterbury",,,,,,,"http://library.canterbury.ac.nz/thesis/etheses_copyright.shtml","All Rights Reserved",,,,,,,,,,,,"Re-imagining the posthuman in counsellor education : entanglements of matter and meaning in the performative enactments of counsellor-in-training identities.",,,"Electronic Thesis or Dissertation",,,"Education","University of Canterbury",,"Doctoral",,,"Doctor of Philosophy",,,"2586156",,"College of Education, Health and Human Development, University of Canterbury",,"Shanee.barraclough@canterbury.ac.nz",,,,,,,,,"Kathleen Quinlivan"

The aim was to establish which assessments these teachers used and the extent to which the assessments influenced the IEP process and the teacher’s daily practice. The question was raised as to which assessments might provide reliable valid data to track the development of deaf and hearing-impaired students in New Zealand. The key findings from the study included that Teachers of the Deaf use assessments commonly used in deaf education more often than classroom assessments, but do make significant use of running records as well.  There were differences between the two Deaf Education Centres use of assessment, and also disparity in the ways teachers arrive at assessment decisions such as allocating a curriculum level to a learning area.  There was variance between the assessments used by a Teacher of the Deaf working in a satellite classroom, and the assessments completed by itinerant Resource Teachers of the Deaf. There appeared to be deaf students on Resource Teacher of the Deaf caseloads who were not assessed in mathematics by either the class teacher or the Teacher of the Deaf and the level of support by Teachers of the Deaf in mathematics is low. From within the complex picture of the assessment landscape for deaf students there are a number of signposts for future direction suggested by this study. These are: the need for a national assessment policy for deaf students; the need for data to be gathered nationally about the achievement of deaf students; sustained professional development around Teacher of the Deaf, common classroom assessments and national assessment tools; a closer look at the marking guidelines for Formal Retells and the need for student self-assessment practices to be further encouraged.",,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/4912",,,,"en",,,,,"University of Canterbury.

About 85% of 6 million inhabitants live in rural PNG where basic services are lacking or non-existent. Difficulties such as lack of infrastructures like road network and communication, geographical barriers like big mountain ranges, large rivers and swamps, shortage of skilled health professionals and higher concentration of health workers in cities pose great challenges in delivering health services effectively across the country. Telehealth may play an important role in reaching health services to the underserved population in PNG. As part of this study, it is essential to assess the potential of telehealth to enhance the delivery of health services. Specifically, this research aims to report the knowledge, attitudes and skills towards information and communication technology of health care providers in PNG. The study used a cross sectional method of health professionals working at the time of the survey. It collected 174 questionnaires from four hospitals and used SPSS (version17.0) to analyse the data. The results showed that younger male physicians, paramedics, those with gadgets, higher educational qualifications and exposed to ICT resources possess better knowledge and skills than female, older age group and those without gadgets or under exposed to ICT. Currently, the health care professionals in general have leap frogged the technology by focusing on handheld devices such as cell phones rather than landlines.

sector and courses are now offered in an online learning environment with variable success.
There has been a range of studies concerning online learning however there is little research
about the role of information technologies in promoting professional learning for teaching
practitioners. Initially courses were posted online using the resources from a face-to-face course
for the course members to download. Now the capabilities of the internet allow for a range of
technologies to be used to enhance the learning in an online learning environment.
Educational practitioners undertake professional development to either develop their skills and
knowledge to improve student learning in their classrooms or for promotional reasons.
Educational practitioners want to be inspired by their teachers when undertaking professional
development. Some researchers point to the relationship between the teacher and the course
members as being an important factor in the success of a course. As many professional
development courses are being delivered in an online learning environment the course members
never meet the teacher and the teacher needs to develop strategies to allow these relationships to
develop.
The aim of this study was to explore the perceptions of educational practitioners who are
undertaking an online professional development course. It sought to understand the teaching
practitioners’ expectations of the teacher in the online environment. A range of strategies was
used to collect the data including questionnaires, data gained from the online learning
environment, email correspondence and semi-structured interviews.
The findings from this study identify the importance of the teacher designing an online learning
environment to enhance learning, by having tasks and assignments related to the course
members’ own practice, and by having a range of interactions that provide reflection
opportunities to enhance thinking and learning. Other important findings included the importance
of the teacher taking an active role in the interactions. .",,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/4203",,,,"en",,,,,"University of Canterbury.

"18422","10092/806",,,,"McIlroy, Anne-Marie",,,,,,,"2017",,,"This research is about teaching, learning and assessment. It is about the belonging of disabled children at school. In New Zealand schools, the term ‘inclusive education’ is associated with the idea of disability. This research moves away from using the term ‘inclusive education’, towards the term ‘belonging’. The intention is to direct focus on all children and on community.

The national New Zealand Curriculum guides all teaching and learning decisions and requires that every child receives quality learning experiences that enable them to achieve (Ministry of Education, 2007, p. 39). New Zealand education policies and documents place children at the centre of assessment processes, where it is intended that their learning progress is recognised and ongoing learning trajectories planned (Ministry of Education, 2011a, 2014, 2016a). Assessment is understood to be critical to quality teaching and learning (Ministry of Education, 2011b). Quality teaching is challenged by assessment practices that fail to account for the learning and progress of some disabled children who are invisible in assessment data. Children may become marginalised within the rich curriculum available to their peers if their learning potential is unrecognised and unsupported (Florian, 2014b; Morton, 2012; Slee, 2011).

This qualitative research project explores the potential of narrative assessment to recognise the capability and learning potential of every child and their belonging in the curriculum and their school community. Narrative assessments incorporate multiple voices to capture and document teaching and learning in authentic contexts, combining observation, recording, interpretation and analysis (Carr & Lee, 2012; Gunn & de Vocht van Alphen, 2010; Ministry of Education, 2009c). They are used formatively to support ongoing praxis, and are personalised to celebrate each child’s strengths and motivations (Wiliam, 2011a). The research aims to inform education policy and teaching practice so all children are recognised as capable learners within collaborative and equitable assessment processes.

The project took place in a primary school in urban New Zealand, involving children, families and educators. A Disability Studies in Education (DSE) framework is used to explain disability as socially, politically and culturally constructed (Gabel, 2005; Mills & Morton, 2013). Critical ethnography was selected as the qualitative approach for this work, as it supported bringing marginalised voices to the fore to unmask discriminatory and repressive practice, and is a means of invoking social consciousness and educational change within broader structures of social power and control (Thomas, 1993). Storytelling is a feature of narrative assessment and is recognised as an effective approach to teaching and learning which can provoke change at a personal and systemic level (Clandinin & Connelly, 2000). The routine inclusion of photographs, artwork, pictures and symbols as well as written text within narrative assessments links to broader concepts of literacy and aligns with the theory of visual ethnography (Kliewer, 2008b; Pink, 2007; Rose, 2012).

This research challenged “the myth of inability”, bringing teams together to show that a formative approach to narrative assessment recognised the capability and learning success of every child by incorporating the voices of children and those who know them well in responsive, effective classroom pedagogy (Lundy, 2007; Skidmore, 2002; Smith, 2015; Wansart, 1995, p. 175). Narrative assessment enables teachers as caring and professional leaders of classroom learning to support children’s belonging within the vision, values, principles and learning areas of the New Zealand Curriculum (Monchinski, 2010; Noddings, 1995).",,,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/14939",,,"en","English",,,,"University of Canterbury",,,,,,,"http://library.canterbury.ac.nz/thesis/etheses_copyright.shtml","All Rights Reserved",,,,,,,,,,,,"""The myth of inability"" : exploring children's capability and belonging at primary school through narrative assessment.",,,"Electronic Thesis or Dissertation",,,"Education","University of Canterbury",,"Doctoral",,,"Doctor of Philosophy",,"2587697",,,"College of Education, Health and Human Development, University of Canterbury",,"amm.dnnz@gmail.com",,,,,,,,,"Missy Morton"
"4372","10092/806",,,"Sahrawat, Ramesh",,,,,,,,"2010",,,"Corticosteroids are the most potent and reliable of the available agents among the anti-inflammatory drugs, and have assumed a major role in the management of asthma. This has subsequently resulted in the global widespread use of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS). A variety of studies have been undertaken to examine the effects of ICS on voice production among people with asthma. Most research suggests that the long-term use of ICS has a negative effect on voice production. However, the results of these studies are limited because of the reliance upon examining an asthmatic population and not consistently recording the dose prescribed. As a result, one cannot exclude that some of the voice problems may have been previously caused by asthma and thus, the contributing effects of ICS are obscured. Therefore, an ideal approach to examine the influence of ICS on voice is to test its short-term effects on healthy individuals, using a specific ICS (Fluticasone Propionate) at a fixed dose (1000 µg/Day). Thirty healthy adults (15 females & 15 males) aged between 18 to 30 years participated in this study. All participants were non-smokers with no history of speech, language or voice disorder. No participants had a history of asthma, respiratory illness hospital admission or inhaler use within the past 3 months. All participants followed the treatment regime often prescribed by physicians (in Canterbury region) for treating asthma (500 µg in morning & 500 µg in evening). Each participant self administered (inhaled) two puffs of ICS in the morning and again in the evening over a six day period. Voice samples were audio-recorded prior to undergoing the ICS regime, at various points during the ICS regime, and at the conclusion of ICS regime. Each participant’s audio-recorded samples were submitted for acoustic analysis using a commercially available speech analysis system (CSL 4300B, Kay Elemetrics, 1994). Three measures were performed, (1) vocal fundamental frequency (F0), (2) long-time spectral analysis (LTAS) and (3) formant frequency and formant frequency bandwidth. The results of this study indicate that ICS does have an effect on acoustic properties of voice. These effects were more evident in connected speech compared to isolated vowel productions. In particular, the spectral tilt and first spectral peak of continuous speech samples were found to change from baseline. The current results are discussed in regard to the phonatory deterioration associated with ICS use. The present study provides a framework for developing ICS treatment for respiratory disease in the phase of minimizing adverse effects on voice.",,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/4964",,,,"en",,,,,"University of Canterbury.

"5296","10092/806",,,,,"Dunnachie, Bronwyn",,,,,,"2000",,,"Depression is one of the most debilitating experiences to affect both individuals and society in New Zealand. When it is experienced during the formative years of adolescence, its consequences can be devastating. To date, the knowledge of this experience has been inadequate, information being gathered by methods that do not portray the perspectives of young people who have experienced depression. This thesis addresses this inadequacy by presenting an interpretation of young people's experience of clinical depression.
 The research process involved my extensive interviewing of 11 young people who met 'The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual Of Psychiatric Disorder Number IV' (DSM-IV, 1994) criteria for a Major Depressive Episode (American Psychiatric Association [APA], 1994, p.317). Their perspectives were sought from their position of recovering from depression. I also interviewed 8 of their caregivers. Both sets of perspectives provided insight into the devastation that young people and their families experience as a result of depression. By exploring the participants' subjective worlds and interpreting this data from a symbolic-interactionist perspective, three key themes emerged. These were their experiences of powerlessness, of feeling stigmatised, and of an altered sense of self.
 It was also clear from the analysis that relationships were the key to both positive and negative ways in which the participants experienced depression. The relationships that were important to recovery were those with caregivers, peers, health professionals, and the researcher. Consequently I suggest that enhancing all of the interpersonal relationships identified as important by young people with depression will be integral to healing. These relationships can be redefined as ""therapeutic relationships"".",,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/4889",,,,"en",,,,,"University of Canterbury.

"5162","10092/806",,,"Gallrach, Franziska",,,,,,,,"2010",,,"Background:
Multivariate analyses of quality of life (QoL) in dementia are relatively rare. This study was the first aiming to measure QoL of persons with dementia and their informal caregivers in New Zealand. To date, it is also the only study examining what interventions from primary and secondary care in New Zealand are helpful for enhancing QoL and what these interventions cost.

Methods:
In this prospective cohort study, questionnaires (including the Quality of Life-Alzheimer’s Disease Scale and the Neuropsychiatric Inventory) investigating various QoL-domains were administered to 53 outpatients of a memory clinic recently diagnosed with dementia, and their caregivers at baseline and 12-month follow-up. Time and resource utilisation were assessed in order to identify direct and indirect costs using questionnaires and diaries (over 12 months).

Results:
Cognition scores of persons with dementia (PWDs) ranged from 49 to 91 on the Modified-Mini-Mental State Examination (3MS); scores on the Clinical Dementia Rating Scale (CDR) ranged from 0.5 to 3, with 83% of PWDs being in the early stages of the illness at baseline (CDR ≤ 1).
Most PWD measurements confirmed the predicted correlations including a strong link between PWDs’ and caregivers’ QoL. Many correlations remained stable over 12 months. Combined information and support interventions achieved significantly better PWD and caregiver QoL than single interventions. Direct costs (including costs of informal caregiving time) increased with an increase in dementia severity, neuropsychiatric and behavioural symptoms and functional limitations. There was a clear trend that caregivers were more distressed if patients received less in-home support. Direct non-medical costs of PWDs living at home did not increase with the severity of PWDs’ cognitive impairment. In 2008/09, there were an estimated 1,896 persons in Canterbury providing a total of 5.47 million hours of care for PWDs. This unpaid care had a value of NZ $135.8 million. Caregivers were much more likely to be depressed if they had a low income. More than one-third of family-caregivers (39.5%) thought that financial compensation for their time spent caring would enable them to look after the PWD at home for longer.

Conclusions:
A mix of different clinical and non-clinical (including economic) factors can predict QoL in dementia. The strong link between PWDs’ and caregivers’ QoL calls for a systemic approach in dementia care. QoL can be sustained over 1 year in a cohort of mainly early dementia patients and their informal caregivers. Developing psychosocial and financial incentives could be a key factor to support PWDs and their informal caregivers in New Zealand, consequently enabling them to live in the community for longer. These outcomes also have implications for health professionals and social policy makers which must be addressed as health practitioners and the wider community strive both for best practice and for cost-effective care of our increasingly ageing population.",,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/4818",,,,"en",,,,,"University of Canterbury.

"4609","10092/806",,,"Southern, Annie Roma",,,,,,,,"2010",,,"This thesis explores the experiences of a group of women in Aotearoa/New Zealand who have been diagnosed with a psychiatric illness, with the aim of gaining some understanding about how they negotiate issues around diagnosis, recovery and resilience-development and employment.  

A qualitative methodology was used to encourage the women to relate their vocational and life experiences.  Fifteen women, whose ages ranged from 17 to their late 60s, with a range of psychiatric diagnoses, were interviewed across ten months. One woman identified as having Māori ancestry and several identified as lesbian. Each interview, which was semi-structured, was transcribed and then verified by the women, and all data were analysed using thematic content analysis and symbolic interactionist and discourse/narrative analyses.  Salient issues provided a focus for later interviews and generated theory. 
 
The thesis is organised according to major themes that were generated from the data: ‘Getting unwell and getting help,’ ‘Getting well’ and ‘Getting back to work.’  Within these broad themes, key ideas emerged around the women’s views on the difference between ‘madness’ and ‘mental illness’, the biological basis for mental distress, the impact of labelling, the importance of having a ‘literacy’ around psychiatric illness that helps foster agency, the importance of workplace accommodations and mentors in vocational settings, and the process of renegotiating vocational identity when one has a psychiatric illness.

Data analysis revealed how participants make ‘sense’ of their psychiatric ill health and recovery/resilience-development experiences, create a vocational self-concept and view themselves as social beings in the current socio-political and cultural context of being New Zealanders. The women’s narratives exhibited negligible explicit gender role identification and the present research uncovered very little explicit data relevant to lesbian and bisexual women’s lives, apart from data on sexual identity disclosure.

The thesis, therefore, provides a platform for understanding the experiences of women living with psychiatric illness in Aotearoa/New Zealand.  It provides new information on service-users’ views of medical models of psychiatric illness and the efficacy of their alliances with mental health professionals.

In practice, boundary detection is difficult because most images contain texture. Normally, texture-boundary detectors are complex, and so cannot run in real-time. On the other hand, the few texture boundary detectors that do run in real-time leave much to be desired in terms of quality. This thesis proposes two real-time texture-boundary detectors – the Variance Ridge Detector and the Texton Ridge Detector – both of which can detect high-quality texture-boundaries in real-time. The Variance Ridge Detector is able to run at 47 frames per second on 320 by 240 images, while scoring an F-measure of 0.62 (out of a theoretical maximum of 0.79) on the Berkeley segmentation dataset. The Texton Ridge Detector runs at 10 frames per second but produces slightly better results, with an F-measure score of 0.63. These objective measurements show that the two proposed texture-boundary detectors outperform all other texture-boundary detectors on either quality or speed. As boundary detection is so widely-used, this development could induce improvements to many real-time computer vision applications.",,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/4951",,,,"en",,,,,"University of Canterbury.

"5886","10092/806",,,"Clelland, Tracy Julia",,,,,,,,"2011",,,"There is a developing international understanding of the relationship between gender, wellbeing and educational outcomes. Wellbeing influences students’ abilities to learn and emotional wellbeing is fundamental to children’s learning and ability to develop positive relationships with others. Research has found that those who have emotional competencies and skills find it easier to manage themselves, relate to others, resolve conflict, and feel positive about themselves and the world around them (CASEL, 2003; Greatz, 2008). Boys’ emotional wellbeing has been a particular focus of the discussion because of their lack of engagement at school and increasing levels of violence and bullying. 
This qualitative study investigated the factors that influenced the emotional wellbeing of a group of 12 year old boys in their final year of primary school. This age group was the focus of this research as it is a transitional age in relation to puberty and secondary school. The study involved one adult listening to, and making meaning from eight young boys’ perceptions of their world during a semi-structured interview with two focus groups. Analysing the data involved the qualitative strategy of thematic analysis where themes and categories were identified and then further analysed for corresponding linkages and relationships. 
The findings identified a multifaceted range of factors that influenced boys’ emotional wellbeing. Family, friendships, school and the wider community were all specifically identified as enhancing or harming emotional wellbeing. Strongly underpinning all of the factors was the influence of normalised gendered behaviours within different social contexts that enforced conformity towards a hegemonic form of masculinity. Boys’ failure to follow the ‘rules’ assigned to a social groupings hegemonic form of masculinity, ran the risk for them of being relegated to a lower rank, being unable to manage or express emotions, being excluded, or becoming the victim of bullying. 
The research concluded that boys need support in developing a wide range of personal and interpersonal skills and strategies to enhance emotional wellbeing. Underpinning the development of these skills however, is the need for a safe and supportive home, peer group and school environment where students can be empowered to think critically and deconstruct the way in which gender norms influence social interaction and behaviour. Peers, teachers, schools, families and the wider community working in synergy are crucial to developing an approach that addresses and enhances emotional wellbeing.",,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/5443",,,,"en",,,,,"University of Canterbury.

Previous studies have focused on concordance between doctors and other supervising personnel in regards to safety outcomes. ETTs are increasingly supervised by nurses now as a result of medical devolvement in this role. This study contributes a new perspective to international literature and focuses on understanding the process of role development for cardiac nurses who supervise ETTs.
 The overall aim was to gain greater understanding of how cardiac nurses have developed in the role of supervising ETTs and what their process has been. This is a mixed methods study that has utilised both qualitative descriptive techniques and descriptive quantitative data. These data were obtained by individual interviews with ETT nurses and the Clinical Director of Cardiology, and a survey of technicians who work alongside the ETT nurses at a tertiary hospital. Data were also obtained from a national survey of cardiac centres in New Zealand. Both methods were employed to give greater depth to the subject and place local findings in context with national data and international literature.
 Findings show there have been a number of international and local evolutionary factors contributing to the emergence of the ETT nurse’s role over time. Specific themes emerged from the interviews that describe individual process of role development. Technicians identified that the ETT service has improved as a consequence of having ‘dedicated ETT nurses’. Variability in regards to work place practices, training and assessment were found in the national survey. 
There is further potential for both increasing the number of nurses practicing as ETT nurses and further  expansion of the role, however continued fragmentation, inconsistent  service delivery and variation in national standards for practice in New Zealand may be barriers to collective and individual role development.",,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/5228",,,,"en",,,,,"University of Canterbury.

This study, informed by the work of Shulman (1986) and Grossman (1990), examines knowledge for mathematics teaching by pre-service teachers. The context for this study was a mathematics education course, part of an Initial Teacher Education programme for primary teaching. Different categories of teacher knowledge distinguish between content knowledge and pedagogical content knowledge. There is considerable research about the knowledge needed for teaching mathematics from a teacher perspective, but limited research from a pre-service teacher perspective. This study focussed on knowledge that pre-service teachers develop and the processes they engaged in to construct knowledge for mathematics teaching.
This is a qualitative and interpretive study, where participants were third year pre-service teachers. Data collection tools were questionnaires and focus group interviews. One interview made use of an artefact, a curriculum plan for mathematics, generated by the pre-service teachers as they participated in the mathematics education course. A thematic analysis approach was used to analyse the data and to inform an emerging theoretical framework.
During this study, I developed a model that illustrates some important processes for pre-service teachers in a curriculum context. The Pre-service Teacher Development Model consists of three processes; recognising, reconceptualising and realising. These three processes illustrate how pre-service teachers develop knowledge about teaching mathematics in a primary school. The pre-service teachers identified the importance of mathematical curriculum and content knowledge in their preparation for teaching. This study also identified that the needs of pre-service teachers are unique. Whereas teachers with experience have a “privileged repertoire” of practices to draw on when teaching, pre-service teachers are beginning to develop this repertoire. This study serves to highlight the challenges for pre-service teachers as they prepare to transition to their first year of teaching.",,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/5187",,,,"en",,,,,"University of Canterbury.

"5163","10092/806",,,"McBain, Suzanne Cynthia",,,,,,,,"2010",,,"This qualitative case study combined teacher and student interviews with observations of one physical education class to facilitate understandings of physical education learning communities.  Watkins’ (2005) definition of a learning community was used as a framework to conceptualise the study.  I found that physical education teachers in this study do actively develop their classes as learning communities.  Five key findings are discussed.
 
Physical education learning communities exist in a number of different forms that can be related to a learning community continuum.  The learning community’s positioning on the continuum is directly related to student agency in learning. It was found that student agency is promoted through a discourse of inquiry.  In this study inquiry is a central tenet of a learning community as learning is viewed as a cognitive and socio-cultural constructivist function resulting in knowledge generation (Brown, 1997 cited in Alton Lee 2003; Sewell, 2006; Watkins, 2005).  As inquiry learning is a social process in a learning community, it is concurrently supported by a discourse of community, promoting students’ ability to work altruistically and collaboratively, learning together.  

It was found that the explicit teaching of socio-moral outcomes through socio-cultural pedagogies enhance positive peer relationships and is essential to the promotion of an altruistic discourse of community.  The discourses of community and inquiry are dialectically related and communicate clear messages to students about the expectations of behaviour and learning within an altruistic community.  The early stages of a physical education learning community are based on the genuine and altruistic student-teacher relationships which provide a springboard to allow opportunities for teachers to have further conversations about learning.
   
Finally, evidence in the study suggests that philosophy plays a significant role in both the growth and oppression of the evolution of a learning community.  This study suggests that the relationship between the philosophy of the New Zealand Curriculum (2007), the physical education teachers and the economic neoliberal context influences the development of learning communities in physical education.",,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/4828",,,,"en",,,,,"University of Canterbury.

However, in comparison to the wealth of general counselling research, there is a relative lack of research involving clients with an intellectual disability. In particular, there is a scarcity of research exploring the clients’ subjective experiences of counselling. This thesis therefore seeks to gain a better understanding of this under-explored area of counselling practice by inquiring of the two parties most intimately acquainted with the counselling process – clients and counsellors. Complementing the views of clients and counsellors, the views of support workers and key informants are also described.

Using a qualitative case study methodology, six clients with an intellectual disability were interviewed about their subjective experiences of counselling. Interviews were also conducted with their counsellors and with nominated support people. These interviews took place over a period of several months. In addition, single interviews were conducted with four key informants in order to gain an understanding of the local health and disability support services.

This thesis explores the participants’ understandings of disability and counselling, discusses similarities and differences to general counselling and describes the outcomes of the six clients in this study. This thesis highlights four systemic problems that complicate the delivery of effective counselling services: (a) poverty, (b) health inequalities, (c) difficulties in the disability support workforce, and (d) social stigma. The thesis also draws attention to the need for specialised education for both counsellors and the disability support workforce. Researchers are invited to pursue further research.

"5559","10092/806",,,"MacDonald, Margaret",,,,,,,,"2010",,,"This study examines the work of Elwyn Stuart Richardson, director and teacher of Oruaiti School between 1949 and 1962, an experimental school in Northland, New Zealand and places it with the context of the history of art education in New Zealand. After documenting the historical and educational reform contexts of the first half of the twentieth century, Richardson’s philosophy of art education is framed through an analysis of moments of his early life, schooling and teaching experiences. 

Richardson (1925-) is best known for his book In the Early World published by the New Zealand Council of Educational Research in 1964. The book describes his work as a teacher at Oruaiti and highlights his pedagogical belief that the most powerful learning arises out of children’s own lives and experiences, that learning through the arts raises students’ potential for self-knowledge, critical discernment, imagination, understanding, awareness and empathy for others, and that the arts have an important role to play in the fostering of community and social reform.

The administration of art and craft education in the New Zealand primary school during Richardson’s years at Oruaiti was shaped by early advances in manual and technical education. The development of these reforms and the varied educational doctrines school officials used to advocate for the inclusion of these subjects in the curriculum are examined from 1885 to 1920. As well, significant educational policies and events in the 1920s provided exposure to progressive education ideology from abroad. These initiatives contributed to the great interest in child art which grew out of the New Education movement of the 1930s. New ideas about the development of artistic ability in children led to innovative policies in art and craft education that transformed teaching practices and the place of art and craft in New Zealand schools during the 1940s and 1950s. The newly formed Art and Craft Branch of the Department of Education in 1946 reorganised the administration of art education to change public perceptions of art, create contexts of art appreciation and develop community education in tandem with primary school art education. 

Examining Richardson’s educational biography is another lens used to understand his philosophy and pedagogy. Oruaiti's status as an experimental school is explored through the unique relationship of Oruaiti School to the Art and Craft Branch of the Department of Education. Further, Richardson’s developing educational philosophy, in particular his ideas about artistic ability in children and the growth of aesthetic standards, is explored relative to the teaching practices of his day. 

The study also uncovers the critical role that science played in Richardson’s educational pedagogy and curriculum and the profound influence Richardson’s early educative experiences were to have on the development of his educational philosophy. Locating Richardson’s work within its historical context demonstrates both that he worked in an environment which was hospitable to educational experimentation in the field of art and crafts, and that, on many levels, he transcended the educational practices of his times.",,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/5114",,,,"en",,,,,"University of Canterbury.

When the sibling relationships between children with ASD and their typically developing siblings are considered, challenges and opportunities present themselves for both siblings. This study assessed the effectiveness of a sibling intervention that aimed to meet the needs of both siblings involved.
 It was initially hypothesised that teaching the typically developing children responsive strategy use would enhance their interactions between the children leading to increases in the quality of the sibling relationship and in the well-being of both siblings. In addition, the typically developing children were given developmentally appropriate information on their sibling’s difficulties, information on emotions, and the opportunity to play mutually enjoyable games with their sibling with ASD to enhance their motivation to persist in attempts at interacting with their sibling with ASD. 
Initial findings suggested that the planned intervention was not necessarily benefitting the typically developing children. The focus of the intervention changed to include a more explicit focus on the influence of the intervention on the typically developing children. Changes were made, by de-emphasising the strategy component and emphasising the other components, to enable both siblings to benefit from the intervention. 
Findings indicated that the typically developing children had existing skills for interacting with their siblings with ASD. Increases in the quality of the sibling interactions and the well-being of both children seemed to be most strongly related to aspects of the intervention that increased the warmth of the children’s feelings towards each other and the typically developing children’s understanding and tolerance of their sibling with ASD. Overall, the findings from this project emphasised the importance of supporting family members of children with ASD for the benefit of both the family members and the benefit of the children with ASD.",,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/5229",,,,"en",,,,,"University of Canterbury.

Underpinning this task is Foucault’s theoretical assumption that knowledge is not scientifically constructed through objective and rational methods. Knowledge, under Foucault’s theoretical framework, is influenced by the more obscure conditions of possibility which affect power relations and, therefore, power-knowledge. Therefore, New Zealand’s scientific discourse around therapeutic sexual exploitation is analysed by moving between the discursive and the extra-discursive. This is undertaken to highlight the more obscure conditions of possibility which may have affected the political construction of knowledge and its material effects in the area of therapeutic sexual exploitation. 
New Zealand’s academic discourse on therapeutic sexual exploitation is examined with reference to the social conditions which have influenced the origins of counselling and psychotherapy in New Zealand. This includes an exploration of the links between counselling and psychotherapy to other New Zealand based psy-professions. In particular, an investigation is conducted as to how disciplinary procedures have been applied to those connected to, and affected by, therapeutic sexual exploitation. This, however, is studied by locating New Zealand’s discourse within an international discourse on therapeutic sexual exploitation. This wider lens shows how New Zealand’s discourse around therapeutic sexual exploitation, as other countries’ discourses on this matter, has developed in response to local social conditions and changing power relations. 
Through this broader analysis of New Zealand’s discursive formation on therapeutic sexual exploitation one can see the interplay between silence, knowledge and power, and its material effects on the lives on people. This dissertation highlights not only what knowledge-power might be restricting, but also what it might be producing in the area of therapeutic sexual exploitation, the impacts of which, it will be argued, extends well beyond the particular domain under examination.",,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/5113",,,,"en",,,,,"University of Canterbury.

"5297","10092/806",,,,,"Perrin, Kyle Gareth",,,,,,"2010",,,"Uncontrolled oxygen is often administered to breathless patients regardless of whether hypoxaemia is present. In acute exacerbations of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (AECOPD) this may result in carbon dioxide (CO2) retention and worsening respiratory failure in some patients. In AECOPD the main mechanism is the release of hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction and an increase in the physiological dead space to tidal volume ratio (VD/VT). Acute asthma and pneumonia have features in common with AECOPD, namely significant ventilation – perfusion mismatch; and there is the potential for CO2 retention to occur if uncontrolled high concentration oxygen is given. There have been no randomised controlled trials of oxygen therapy in pneumonia and only one in asthma. The potential mechanisms of any change in arterial CO2 that may occur with oxygen therapy in respiratory disorders other than COPD remain uncertain. 

This thesis presents work from three clinical studies. In two randomised controlled trials, high concentration oxygen was compared to titrated oxygen therapy in patients with either acute severe asthma and suspected community acquired pneumonia. Oxygen was administered for one hour in conjunction with standard medical treatment. Transcutaneous CO2 (PtCO2) was continuously monitored and the number of patients with pre-specified increases in PtCO2 were calculated. The proportion of patients with a rise in PtCO2 4 mmHg was significantly higher in the high concentration oxygen groups of both studies. In the pneumonia study 36/72 (50.0%) vs 11/75 (14.7%) met this endpoint, with a relative risk of 3.4 (95% CI 1.9 to 6.2; P <0.001), and in the asthma study 22/50 (44%) vs 10/53 (18.9%) met this endpoint, with a relative risk of 2.3 (95% CI 1.2 to 4.3; P=0.009). Similarly, a rise in PtCO2 8 mmHg was more common with high concentration oxygen. In the pneumonia study 11/72 (15.3%) vs 2/75 (2.7%) of patients met this endpoint, with a relative risk of 5.7 (95% CI 1.3 to 25.0; P=0.007), and 10/50 (20%) vs 3/53 (5.7%) of asthma patients met this endpoint, with a relative risk of 3.6 (95% CI 1.1 to 12.3; P=0.03). A third study measured the physiological response to 20 minutes of 100% oxygen in chronic severe asthma, with comparison to a group of negative controls (normal subjects) and positive controls (COPD patients). There was a significant rise in PtCO2 of similar magnitude in the asthma and COPD groups compared with the normal controls. The mechanism of the PtCO2 rise was similar in asthma and COPD, with an increase in VD/VT but no change in minute ventilation. 

These studies demonstrate than uncontrolled high concentration oxygen has the potential to cause CO2 retention in respiratory diseases other than COPD, and that in asthma the mechanism of hypercapnia is similar to that in AECOPD. In acute asthma and community-acquired pneumonia oxygen should be administered only to those patients with evidence of arterial hypoxaemia in a dose that relieves hypoxaemia without causing hyperoxia, thereby achieving the benefits of oxygen therapy while reducing the potential for harm.",,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/5079",,,,"en",,,,,"University of Canterbury.

"5268","10092/806",,,"Cowan, Jacqueline Lisa",,,,,,,,"2010",,,"The aim of this qualitative case study is to identify how teachers and students perceive students’ self worth to be influenced in the learning environment and examine the
similarities and differences in the way teachers and students described these influences. 

Implications for classroom practice are identified. Semi-structured interviews were conducted to collect data from four teachers and four focus groups of students aged 12-13 years from two different schools. Data was analysed using a thematic approach that allowed for identification of similarities and differences in teachers’ and students’ responses and provided a structure for discussion.

On analysis of the findings it is evident that aspects of the learning environment and interactions students have within the learning environment have the potential to
influence students’ self worth. Findings indicate that students who appear to have good self worth seem to find the learning environment a positive place to be. Good self
worth is characterised by strong perceptions of ability, achievement related behaviour and positive social interactions. Poor self worth appears to be influenced by what students perceive to be under achievement with, in some instances, a relationship to negative prior experiences related to under achievement. Under achievement seems to impact on the students’ conscious decision to employ a variety of avoidance-related behaviours in an attempt to limit incidences of failure in front of peers.

Findings suggest that there are four main areas of influence on students’ self worth that relate to: achievement, teacher qualities, teacher strategies and connections made with significant other people such as parents/guardians and coaches. Positive self worth
appears to be strongly connected to academic achievement in a reciprocal manner where each influences the other. The socio-cultural influences such as positive teacher and
peer relationships and support of significant others, teacher strategies including pedagogical approach and supportive learning environments /communities that promote
a sense of safety and belonging are described as fundamental to the development of self worth.

This study discusses the need for schools to provide opportunities for holistic development where students can grow through social, emotional, ethical and academic
learning experiences in a socially emotionally and physically safe learning environment. Learner-centred or self-directed pedagogical approaches to teaching and learning appear to provide a basis on which to meet the holistic needs of students. It is clear however
that the effect of more empowering pedagogical approaches is influenced heavily by the teachers’ personal and professional approaches to meeting the needs of their students.  This study shows that self worth is more likely to be enhanced when students feel empowered and involved in the learning process and understand their responsibility
within the learning process. Teacher practice and students’ response to the learning environment can be greatly enhanced through the use of critical reflective strategies that allow teachers and students to become more knowledgeable about each other and the influences of the learning environment.  

Finally, evidence suggests that self worth is enhanced by a humanistic philosophy. This philosophy seems to underpin positive relationships and other socio-cultural characteristics of the classroom learning environment that enhance self worth. This is consistent with the philosophical framework of the New Zealand Curriculum(2007).

Findings suggest that, if implemented authentically and with understanding this curriculum can provide a strong basis for enhancing students’ self worth and achievement, and meet the all round needs of students as people, through an ethic of care.",,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/4933",,,,"en",,,,,"University of Canterbury.

This research considers how young children perceive the up and coming ‘rite of passage’ of ‘starting school’. Through placing an emphasis on ‘children’s voice’, it explores their expectations, feelings and understandings of school before and after starting. The study follows six children (two boys and four girls, aged from 4 years eight months to 4 years ten months at the start of the study) for approximately two school terms on their journey from an Early Childhood Centre to a primary school. A range of ‘child friendly’ methods were used to gather their understandings. Children’s ‘school comments’ were recorded by their mothers during their transition. Interviews were conducted with three teachers regarding their philosophies and practices of starting school. 

The findings identified three main themes in children’s initial knowledge about school. The children sourced further knowledge by asking their parents about any concerns or queries as they arose. They also expressed a need to prepare themselves for school. The children gained further understanding of school throughout their transition but did not truly grasp the concept of what school was about until they became ‘school kids’ themselves.

and understanding of the world in which they live in. The most common way for assessing
students’ proficiency is through formal examinations. In Samoa, the results of national
examinations are used to select teachers for promotion, certification and placement. One
major concern of teachers as well as parents in primary schools is that the results of the
Year 8 National Examinations in Samoa have shown a need for improvements in teaching
and learning of science in the primary classes. If the science examination results are to
improve, information is first needed about what is happening in the classrooms when
teachers are teaching science. This research describes the current situation and focuses on
the challenges that are encountered by teachers in their preparation and planning of their
daily classroom teaching. The research project also evaluates how the Primary Educational
Materials Project (PEMP) have been utilised as these materials emphasise the use of
student-centred approaches to learning and can potentially help in the preparation of both
pre-service and in-service teachers,
The purpose of this research study was to assess the use of PEMP books and resources
that are used by teachers teaching science in Year 8 classes. Three science teachers’
classes were observed, administered with questionnaires and then interviewed on how they
plan using the PEMP books to teach science. Discussions and interviews with the teachers
provide insights about their assumptions and beliefs in teaching science. Responses
revealed that subject matter knowledge is crucial for good teaching and student
understanding. Participants expressed the need for more professional training in order to
develop skills like questioning, critical thinking and creating curiosity and interest in students.

"6800","10092/806",,,"Clarke, Te Hurinui",,,,,,,,"2010",,,"During the 1960’s Maori concerned about the state of te reo Maori lobbied the government to have te reo Maori included as a teaching subject in the New Zealand curriculum. In the early 1970’s they reaped the rewards of their hard fought efforts when te reo Maori became a taught subject in the New Zealand curriculum. However, even with te reo being taught in English medium schools, its use was still in decline creating even more anxiety about its survival.
In the 1980’s Maori took the matter into their own hands and the birth of Maori medium early childhood education centres named Kohanga Reo (Language Nests) was the result. Shortly afterwards Maori medium primary schools (Kura Kaupapa Maori) emerged followed by Maori medium secondary schools (Wharekura). There was a ground swell of support for
these community driven initiatives and it seemed te reo Maori would be returned from the brink of extinction. Even given the emergence of Maori medium educational facilities
including Wananga (Tertiary Institutes), the majority of Maori students have remained in English medium education. After a respite of about twenty years it would seem that te reo Maori is once again on the decline.
For many years kaiako reo Maori (Maori language teachers) in English medium secondary schools have grappled with the issue of high attrition rates from their senior te reo Maori
programmes. This is a significant issue as 85 percent of akonga Maori (Maori students) still participate in the English medium education system. However this problem plagues not only akonga Maori but also those who are non Maori. Te reo Maori programmes in mainstream New Zealand schools are offered to akonga as optional subjects. While retention is relatively unproblematic for akonga in the junior levels of secondary schools (ages 13 to 14), it
becomes a significant issue in the senior levels (ages 15 to 18) where attrition rates are considerably high. This research attempts to identify the factors that contribute to the high rates of attrition and offers some possible solutions to decreasing attrition rates amongst akonga reo Maori.",,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/6350",,,,"en",,,,,"University of Canterbury.

Research shows that newborns’ health outcome is associated with maternal and other factors. This study was designed to
understand the factors that have an impact on three good newborn care practices: safe cord cutting, early breastfeeding and delayed bathing. 

The study used the interview data of 815 married women aged 15-49 years who delivered a live baby between February 2008 and February 2009, collected for the baseline survey of the Community-Based Maternal and Newborn Health program  implemented in the Sindhuli district of Nepal. The mean age of the sample women was 26 years. Two-thirds of them were from disadvantaged indigenous caste/ethnicity groups, about 70% were uneducated and the majority were poor. Safe cord cutting, early breastfeeding and delayed bathing practices were studied for 803, 810 and 812 women respectively and 70.7%, 46.7%, and 16.6% of the eligible samples demonstrated the practices respectively. The logistic regression method was used to examine the association of
independent factors with the outcome variables.

Social gradient was found to be associated with all three practices. Rich women were more likely to demonstrate good practices and bearing a child at the prime age (20-34 years) was likely to result in safe cord cutting. Disadvantaged indigenous and ‘other’  caste/ethnicity women demonstrated unsafe cord cutting practices and dalit caste/ethnicity women demonstrated poor bathing practices. Maternal knowledge also emerged as a strong predictor of early breastfeeding and delayed bathing practices. Antenatal care from a SBA determined good breastfeeding and advice from a FCHV determined
good bathing practices.

The results showed that the uptake of antenatal and delivery services from a skilled birth attendant is
unacceptably low in rural Nepal, which is a challenge for meeting the millennium development goals. The study recommends programmes for improving economic status as a key to improving newborn care practices. As the vast majority of the deliveries are still assisted by traditional birth attendants; including them in maternal health programmes is crucial. Increasing women’s access to a
skilled birth attendant and boosting the spirit of the FCHVs to increase their efficiency is also recommended. Future research on newborn health should focus on identifying other determinants of newborn care practices and survival. Qualitative studies to understand the cultural perspectives of newborn care practices are also recommended.",,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/5061",,,,"en",,,,,"University of Canterbury.

"5851","10092/806",,,,,"Sheehan, Dale Catherine",,,,,,"2010",,,"The context of this thesis is learning in internship in New Zealand (NZ). Internship is a period
of apprenticeship in medicine which bridges the transition from medical school to practise as
a registered doctor. It is a formal apprenticeship leading to the professional practise of
medicine, and is central to the identity construction of the junior doctor. However, because the
workplace is changing the traditional model of apprenticeship is described in the literature as
failing. As a consequence, internship has been subject to cycles of review and reform since
the turn of the century, first in the United Kingdom (UK) and more recently in Australia and
NZ. Despite the reforms current literature and professional commentary indicate that the
problems are not all solved by what are essentially structural reforms. A review of the
literature on clinical learning and supervision identifies a gap in the research that is
contributing to the wider problem. While it is recognised that supervision is a key component
of internship there is no conceptual model or framework to guide supervisory practice or to
inform the training of supervisors. This is the problem addressed in this thesis.
This thesis proposes a solution using socio-cultural learning theory to understand learning in
internship in order to offer an explanation of learning that can inform the supervisory practice;
and then for the development of a model of learning and a supervision framework to guide
and inform the practice of interns, supervisors and managers in health provider organisations.
A review of the literature since 1990 (Chapter 2) shows that there has been very little research
on postgraduate supervision but there has been considerable work investigating the learning
environment (or the immediate context of learning), drawing on experiential learning theory,
describing the attributes of supervisors, devising models for giving feedback, and more
recently seeking to understand and explain learning at work and the development of expertise.
However, the transference of research findings into a conceptual and structural model of
supervision has not occurred. In addition, recent research (2002-2010) has demonstrated that
social learning approaches exploring clinical/workplace learning can be useful in bridging this
gap. While there is an emerging body of work exploring the immediate (ward or clinic)
learning climate there remains an absence of research on supervision and little consideration
of the wider organisational and professional context in which internship is conducted.
Before proposing a solution, literature describing the learning demands placed on interns and
the expectations placed on supervisors is used to develop criteria for a specification to guide
the development of a model of supervision that will meet the needs of the sector. The
specification recognises the importance of an underlying educational framework that:
addresses how learning occurs, how competence is developed, the supervisee and supervisor
relationship, relationships with the team, the structure and context of supervision in internship
at both the micro-level (learner environment) and the macro-level (organisational and
national). The specification also recognizes that within the NZ context a model of practicebased
teaching and supervision must be flexible enough to be translated into varied health
contexts, including Maori health environments. Certainly in a Maori world view, learning
(ako) and health practice is seen as part of the community and knowledge is a treasure
(taonga) owned by the community not by individuals. Practice must support the articles of the
Treaty of Waitangi and therefore seek to encourage participation, partnership and self
determination. (This is a legislative requirement in NZ.)
The thesis is reported in three parts looking at the micro-level (learner - supervisor), and
macro-level (organizational) levels of the problem, and then bringing these together to inform
a framework for supervision.
In Part I a series of studies explore interns’ perceptions of learning in clinical areas and
support the proposition that a social learning perspective can be applied to internship. The
initial exploratory qualitative study shows that interns recognise and value a participatory
learning environment with supervision strategies that promote participation and engagement
and which are linked to knowledge sharing and identity formation. From these outcomes a
model is presented that sets out the critical components that ensure clinical settings are
positive learning environments which encourage social interaction. The model also provides
an evaluation tool to assess placements as learning environments. Finally, strategies are
offered that both supervisors and learners can use to promote and support learning in clinical
workplaces.
Part II uses document analysis to describe the organisational and professional context of
learning in internship in order to lay out clearly the wider environment in which internship is
enacted, and to uncover the rich formal, and often tacit, informal learning opportunities
available. Critical analysis of Wenger’s (1998) model of communities of practice (CoPs)
shows that this conceptual model of learning can provide a framework to organize and
consider the learning environment of internship in a way that is more compatible with a teambased
approach to the delivery of healthcare than previous perspectives. Importantly, the CoP
framework also appears to be compatible with a Maori world view and this offers a platform
for future research by, or with, Maori practitioners to develop a blended model of supervision
for Maori health contexts. The CoP framework and its potential as a conceptual model in the
context on internship was shared and discussed within workshops at conferences and learning
events with over 100 practitioners who identify and described three sites where CoPs
naturally occur these are: the clinical team who provide patient care, the interprofessional
ward or unit and the medical team.
In Part III, descriptions of these three sites as CoPs, the data on support structures, formal and
informal learning opportunities within health provider organizations and the outcomes from
Part I are combined to develop a framework of supervision and to describe the roles and
responsibilities of a supervisor. The result of combining these two streams of work is:
1. A model of learning by participation and engagement in clinical practice to guide
supervisory practice and assist interns as they develop the skills needed to be active
lifelong learners throughout their medical careers.
2. An alternative framework from which interns, supervisors and organisations can
view, and therefore plan and coordinate internship.
The thesis is upheld that social learning theory is useful as a framework for understanding
learning in internship and for developing a framework to guide supervision.
The potential to utilise socio-cultural models either as supplementary, or an alternative to
individualistic models, and to utilise team and organisational learning is a strategy that fits
with discourses about healthcare teams, patient safety, inter-professional learning and the
emergent properties and facets of work within current post-reform health services. This thesis
offers an alternative way to conceptualise and define the role of the supervisor and the
supervisee and transform supervisory practice in a way that aligns it to modern healthcare
systems of delivery and accountability with, and to, other health professionals and other
stakeholders.
This study concludes with recommendations for a framework and overarching structure that is
neither implemented nor tested, and this is clearly a necessary direction for future research. It
is hoped that publication of this framework will lead to further testing and refinement,
including its applicability to Maori, and the exploration by Maori medical educators of the
recommendation for a blended model of supervision. Internship as a period of identity
formation is introduced within the framework, but is less well explained than was possible
within this study and warrants further investigation. More work is also needed to explore the
impact on learning of the hierarchical structures in health and the possibility that not all
healthcare environments are friendly and supportive.",,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/5350",,,,"en",,,,,"University of Canterbury.

In reality, these Chinese people are likely to be under stress in their new lives, and therefore, at high risk of mental health problems. Moreover, evidence shows that Chinese people are the under-users of mental health services, and that mental health issues among the Chinese population tend to be under-recognised, under-reported and untreated. Therefore, the method of descriptive qualitative study was chosen and semi-structured interviews were carried out to describe how health providers perceive and support mental health needs of Chinese patients in Christchurch. Purposive sampling was used to identify potential participants, namely the health providers, who have experience of working with Chinese people‘s mental health issues. They were recruited from a wide range of health services, including general practice, psychiatry, social work, counselling, project leadership, health promotion, different management roles, nutrition, nursing, and Chinese medicine. Data analysis was assisted by the computer software Nvivo 8, with thematic analysis used to identify themes and sub-themes which emerged from the information of the interviews.
    
    From the health providers‘ point of view, migration-related stressors and physical problems all pose risks to Chinese people‘s mental health. Although Chinese clients with mental health problems are not commonly seen in the clinical settings, they do potentially have mental health problems and suffer from these issues, but rarely seek mental health support from mainstream services. The health providers pointed out that although good mental health services and information are offered to local people, the existing health care model and health system do not meet Chinese people‘s mental health needs, due to barriers of language and culture. Under these circumstances, the providers indicated that establishing cultural and linguistic mental health services, and offering education to Chinese people and health providers might be helpful in overcoming cultural barriers, improving low access issues and meeting Chinese people‘s mental health needs. This study also identified a range of mental health problems and some groups among the Chinese population with a high risk of mental health issues, both of which need further investigation.",,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/5761",,,,"en",,,,,"University of Canterbury.

"5889","10092/806",,,"Stevens, Kerry Maxwell",,,,,,,,"2011",,,"This study explores educational leadership within and across two of NZ’s eLearning clusters. Two complementary perspectives of educational leadership are used to frame the investigation: instructional leadership and distributed leadership. The research was conducted approximately nine months after the cessation of a two-year Ministry subsidy for the employment of 12 ePrincipals and at a time when Ultrafast Broadband was imminent for nearly all NZ schools.

The literature review explores aspects of two areas related to eLearning leadership: conventional educational leadership in ‘bricks-and-mortar’ schooling contexts and eLearning/eTeaching in virtual schooling contexts. Data was gathered from semistructured interviews with twelve school-based research participants (ePrincipals, eTeachers, Site Supervisors and Principals) across two of NZ’s eLearning clusters and four National Officials with responsibilities for wider forms of eLearning. The findings are presented in a manner that attempts to capture directly the research participants’ voices, while still maintaining confidentiality and anonymity. The findings are discussed using an ecological perspective of eLearning as the unifying framework to explore the leadership across nested and interacting layers, from the micro-level of an eLearning class to the macro-level of NZ’s system for secondary education.

The major findings from the study indicate that educational leadership in eLearning clusters is complex, relies heavily on goodwill and collaboration, and occurs in a challenging environment. Within an eLearning cluster the leadership of eLearning/eTeaching is distributed primarily across the ePrincipal, eTeachers and Site Supervisors who each assume complementary leadership roles. A raft of recommendations, across all ecosystem levels of eLearning, is proposed for leaders to consider when initiating change to strengthen their practices and policies with respect to enhancing eLearning and eTeaching.",,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/5446",,,,"en",,,,,"University of Canterbury.

This school-wide training package develops generalised skills in behaviour management and de-escalation for students who are exhibiting extreme and violent behaviour.  The Team-Teach framework also provides training in physical interventions that are designed for use in schools, and with children.  The legal issues associated with the use of physical intervention are also addressed during the training in addition to recommended best practice for the development of policies and procedures.  Prior evidence suggests that behaviour support training with a physical intervention overlay can result in increased confidence and safety for staff members and a reduction in the levels of physical intervention and incidents.
The purpose of this study was to investigate participant opinion of Team-Teach training immediately after course delivery and further into implementation in addition to an investigation into the barriers and facilitating factors affecting the impact of Team-Teach within two New Zealand special schools.
The research employs a mixed method pragmatic paradigm utilising document analysis, questionnaire and interview survey to ascertain the impact and implementation issues related to Team-Teach training. Quantitative analysis of course feedback ratings and attitudinal scales were combined with the qualitative thematic analysis of written comments and interview transcripts to inform the discussion.
The results present a positive endorsement of Team-Teach training both immediately after the training course and further into implementation and compare favourably with the findings of previous international studies. Research participants reported a significant increase in personal confidence and a perceived reduction in incidences of extreme behaviour and physical intervention. The perceptions of research participants to initial training in New Zealand varied considerably between training providers and there were also notable differences between groups in different work roles and with different levels of experience.  Research participants expressed concern over the lack of adaptation of the Team-Teach syllabus to embrace the New Zealand context.
Research participants endorsed use of the ‘positive handling plan’ (PHP) as a way to legitimatise and standardise practice in difficult situations. It was however clear that neither school had developed genuine parental partnerships in either the creation or effective communication of these plans.  There was a general agreement that parents should be able to access Team-Teach training but significant concerns were highlighted over how this could be achieved in practice.
Research participants endorsed the Team-Teach model of training ‘in-house’ tutors to provide contextual and responsive internal capacity. There was a general agreement that the physical interventions taught were effective and appropriate for use with children. Participants clearly expressed concerns related to the teaching of too many physical interventions that were not required and recommended that training in physical interventions should be in class teams and specific to actual need.
There was a clear indication that research participants believed this training should receive official recognition at the highest level as an acknowledgement that physical intervention is sometimes necessary in schools and that there is a legitimate way to achieve this.",,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/5981",,,,"en",,,,,"University of Canterbury.

"6162","10092/806",,,,,"Rasmussen, Dawn Therese",,,,,,"2010",,,"The aim of this qualitative case study was to examine how the teachers in Samoa were
implementing the Samoa Secondary Schools Health and Physical Education Curriculum and to
assess what problems the teachers were encountering in the implementation of the curriculum
and the barriers that may have contributed to the delay and acceptance of Health and Physical
Education as an academic subject.
Semi-structured interviews were conducted to collect data from teachers and principals of two
different schools. Data was analysed using a thematic approach that allowed for identification of
similarities and differences in teachers’ and principals responses and provided a structure for talanoa
or discussion.
On analysis of the findings, it is apparent that several important aspects of the teaching and learning
environment had an impact on the implementation of the new curriculum. These findings include the
emphasis on examinations within the Samoan educational system, the lack of confidence
demonstrated by the teachers in delivering the content of the Health and Physical Education
curriculum, and the limitations experienced with resources and equipment. Moreover, there was an
obvious concern of the principals in the ability and skills of the teachers in the delivery of the
subject. The findings also indicate that there was more importance placed on theory rather than the
practicals which had negative implications on the time spent out doors on physical activities.
These findings suggest that there are four main areas of influence on the implementation of the new
curriculum; perceptions and attitudes of Health and Physical Education, curriculum knowledge,
pedagogical and content knowledge and resources and training. In order for the new curriculum to be
implemented successfully, these areas will have to be addressed. As it is the new curriculum marks a
new era of development in the Samoa educational system, “a peg in the ground” where a subject that
has been marginalised for so long “O le ma’a sa lafoai’ina e tufuga” (the stone that was rejected by
the carpenters) can now be given the academic value it deserves.",,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/5700",,,,"en",,,,,"University of Canterbury.

"5887","10092/806",,,,,"Kirk, Judy A.",,,,,,"2001",,,"This study investigated the word recognition difficulties, the strategies used for word recognition and the self-beliefs about their ability to read and their reading behaviours, of six severely reading disabled Year Nine and Year Ten adolescents in a New Zealand coeducational, secondary school. Each student was given a year long, individualised, one-on-one reading programme, which taught phonological processing skills, letter-sound knowledge and the strategies to apply and monitor the application of their letter-sound knowledge. The programme also encouraged the students to adopt or maintain very positive self-beliefs about their ability to decipher words and the effectiveness of applying the strategies they were being taught consistently, persistently and with the flexibility to change if their initial attempts were unsuccessful.
 Reading disabled adolescents who experience continual failure are said to come to believe that they do not have the ability to succeed; do not have control over their progress. As a result they do not believe that with effort they can achieve. They become passive learners with a range of avoidance behaviours. They become learned helpless. As a consequence they fail to generalise the skills, knowledge and strategies they possess to new tasks.
 When they entered the programme the participating students had difficulty deciphering most words of two or more syllables. They used incomplete and inaccurate letter information both in their attempts to decipher unfamiliar words and when deciphering one and two syllable, high frequency words that they had read correctly on previous occasions. In addition each had difficulty integrating contextual meaning with letter information as they read.
 The study has shown that each student had their own particular pattern of beliefs about their ability to read and the reading strategies they used. Some students held a mastery pattern of beliefs. They made accelerated progress of up to three age equivalent years in word recognition in the year. They were very optimistic about their ability to read and would tackle text that was, for them, very difficult to decipher. They were consistent and persistent in applying the strategies. Those students who made the most progress learned to be flexible and change their strategy use if they were initially unsuccessful.
 The students who held maladaptive patterns of beliefs made progress of only one age equivalent year or less. The learned helpless students increased their beliefs in the effectiveness of the programme teaching as the year progressed. But they formed and changed their beliefs about their ability to decipher as a result of their classroom experiences. When they changed their beliefs about their ability, they changed their reading behaviours in terms of the programme teaching, because they believed in its effectiveness. They became more consistent and persistent in their use of the strategies they were being taught. One student with a maladaptive pattern of beliefs was not learned helpless but instead held too high a belief in the effectiveness of his reading strategies. This led to a dysfunctional pattern of repeatedly reapplying them.
 The study concluded, first, that the severe reading problems the participating students had resulted from their difficulties with using accurate and complete letter-sound information and their difficulties with integrating this information with the use of contextual meaning to decipher words. These students were capable of using strategies successfully. Whether each student's achievement gains were accelerated or more limited depended on their reading self-beliefs about their ability and their strategy use.
 Second, the study concluded that it is effective to teach a comprehensive programme for word recognition which includes teaching letter-sound information and the strategies to apply this letter sound knowledge and encourages the students to hold positive self-beliefs about their ability to decipher words and their strategy use. It is important that such a programme is run for sufficient time to allow changes in ability beliefs and beliefs about strategy use, time for these changes in beliefs to result in changes in strategy use and time for the changes in strategy use to result in changes in rates of achievement. It is suggested that good liaison between the classroom teacher and the remedial teacher, encouraging students to believe they had control over their learning and using stimulating reading material can be used to hasten changes in ability beliefs and motivation to read.",,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/5444",,,,"en",,,,,"University of Canterbury.

As teaching and learning has continued to evolve and develop in accordance with new research, technological innovations and changing school populations so too has curriculum. The curriculum was designed to initiate a transformation in values, principles, and key competencies that are needed for learners to successfully participate in schooling and society. The New Zealand government introduced a new curriculum in 2007 with the intention of it being implemented into schools by 2010. The content of curriculum was guided by pedagogical understandings supported by research. This included an emphasis on schools having ownership of their curriculum. The 2007 curriculum also had a larger focus on educating the whole child not just on learning objectives.

This research investigates how three schools have undertaken the implementation of the New Zealand Curriculum (2007), and the effects this implementation has had on teaching and learning. Using semi-structured interviews, the descriptive narratives of each teacher’s and school’s experience and understanding has been explored.

"5864","10092/806",,,"Hussain, Hanin Binte",,,,,,,,"2011",,,"This thesis explores how the discourse of complexity thinking can be used to foster emergence in curriculum and practice-based research.  The curriculum-related exploration focused specifically on games of chase as one facet of early childhood curriculum.  It investigated using complexity thinking firstly, to occasion emergence (that is, create a new phenomenon) in children’s games of chase at an early childhood centre and secondly, to describe this emergence.  The research-related exploration focused on creating an emergent methodology which is underpinned by complexity thinking.

In this thesis report, I present a series of emergent curriculum-related phenomena that arose during the explorations, that is, an emergent game, a local curriculum theory for games of chase, the concepts of local curriculum theory, curriculum design and curriculum dynamics, and a curriculum vision.  I also present an understanding of emergent methodology and two methodological innovations in the form of the Research Data Management System and the Visual Summary.

This research involved taking the role of a volunteer teacher-researcher-curriculum designer at an early childhood centre to play games of chase with children.  This role was informed by and contributed to a curriculum design that focused on designing the teaching and learning environment to occasion emergence in learning and curriculum.  

The games of chase curriculum contributed to children’s learning, my own learning and the general rhythm of life at the centre.  The children learnt to distinguish between children who were playing and those who were not.  They also learnt different ways to tag people in a game.  In addition, the children and I developed a game playing routine before playing each game.  This routine involved putting on tag belts, discussing what game we were playing and how we were going to play it.  We played three different games of chase, starting with tag, followed by What is the time Mr(s) Wolf?, and finally the emergent game Big A, Little A.  

The stories of emergence are described in visual, descriptive and narrative texts organised into curriculum stories, teaching stories and children’s learning stories.  Curriculum stories describe the activities that unfolded.  Teaching stories present stories of teaching while learning stories are stories of children’s learning.  These stories represent views of the enacted curriculum as activity, teaching and learning respectively.  Taken together, the stories present a description of the curriculum dynamics that unfolded at the centre in relation to games of chase.
 
This thesis shows that a local curriculum theory for games of chase at the centre emerged from the complex interactions of curriculum design and curriculum dynamics that unfolded at the centre.  It also articulates the emergent concepts of local curriculum theory, curriculum design and curriculum dynamics using the language of complexity.  

This thesis also presents the local curriculum theory as a curriculum vision.  This vision involves a shift in thinking about curriculum as either a set “course to be run” or the “path created in the running” (currere) to embracing curriculum as both “the space for running” and currere.  It is a vision that values both children’s and teachers’ interests, focuses on teachers and children exploring depth and breadth of a curriculum domain together, enables teachers to follow, generate and sustain children’s interest in the explorations, and is generative, flexible and future-focused.  

This thesis conceptualises an emergent methodology as a methodology for emergence which (1) involves the researcher actively striving to foster emergence in research, (2) is brought forth in the interactions between the designed and enacted facets of methodology, (3) is local to a particular research project, and (4) emerges from the interactions of several related strategies.

This thesis can be seen as an attempt to change the language game of curriculum by using the language of complexity throughout the thesis.  In so doing, it not only enables the reader to talk about the discourse of complexity thinking, it also enables the reader to experience the discourse and the emergence of the curriculum-related phenomena and the methodological innovations that are the focus of this thesis.

Finally, this thesis argues that using the discourse of complexity thinking in teaching and research can be enabling.  It can enable the teacher and/or researcher to be creative, flexible and ethical within the constraints of his/her professional and personal life.",,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/5892",,,,"en",,,,,"University of Canterbury.

The present study followed a study by Torok (2009) with sleep-disturbed infants in ECECs. The objective of the current study was to examine the quality of naps in infants described as “typical sleepers” across two settings: the home and the early childhood education centre (ECEC). Two males and two females, ranging in age from 15- to 17-months contributed to four case studies. These were: i) an infant transitioning to the ECEC; ii) and iii) infants described as “settled” in an ECEC; and iv) an infant reported to have sleeping difficulties at home after the occurrence of a major earthquake. Observations from digital recordings were coded to determine sleep states and patterns. The findings across each case study were: i) naps varied in both settings during the infant’s transition to an ECEC but settled in both settings once the infant was “settled” at the ECEC; ii) naps tended to be consistent across both settings in the “typical sleepers” who were settled at the ECEC; and iii) naps at home were varied in the infant reported to have reacted to the earthquake while her naps at the ECEC were consistent. Overall findings suggested that total nap periods tended to be longer at home, sleep efficiency tended to be higher at the ECEC, and that participants tended to engage in more active sleep than quiet sleep. Caregiver presence was a major difference between the home and ECEC setting. This study demonstrated differences and similarities across both settings with infants described as “typical sleepers”.  This is an important area due to the increasing number of infants attending ECECs (Statistics NZ, 2010).

"6356","10092/806",,,,,"Rietveld, Christine M.",,,,,,"2002",,,"The purpose of this study using a qualitative methodology was to investigate the process of transition from preschool to school at an in-depth level for three children with Down Syndrome (DS) and two typically developing children with a view to ascertaining factors associated with effective and ineffective transitions. This begged the question, 'What constitutes an effective transition/what is the purpose of the transition process?' Attention, therefore needed to be focused on identifying the meaning of inclusion at the 'chalk face' of the preschool and school, and identifying the processes underlying it. Bearing in mind that disability theorists argue that it is not so much individual impairments that disable, but society's response to them, this study investigated the range of roles in which the children were included in each of their two settings (preschool and school) and the contextual factors which contributed.
 Findings indicated that at preschool the children with Down Syndrome (DS) were engaged in a narrower range of roles than their typically developing peers. Essentially they were included in level 1 type inclusion (interactions which did not involve any emotional connections with particular children). However, observations at school indicated that inclusion or exclusion were not within-child characteristics, but largely dependent on the context. By the end of the first week of school, one child with DS was actively included in the full range of roles characteristic for that setting (levels 1 and 2 type inclusion). Furthermore, one of the typically developing children who was included at preschool was excluded at school and experienced mostly interactions characteristic of level 1 type inclusion at school. He was unable to become part of a particular peer group or dyad due to the social dynamics of the classroom at the time. Investigation into the processes underlying each outcome indicated that to be included as a valued member in the full range of roles characteristic of that setting required that the processes involve reciprocal, equal and valuing relationships irrespective of disability. However, these processes were shaped by all levels of the schools' educational culture and beliefs, which permeated through the curriculum, pedagogy, assessment procedures and ethos of the institutions, which in all but one school were based on an absence of diversity as a prevailing norm.
 For children to experience facilitative inclusion requires schools to adopt a philosophy of difference, which embraces disability and other differences such as race and gender as valued attributes, as opposed to deficiencies or problems.",,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/5919",,,,"en",,,,,"University of Canterbury.

"6351","10092/806",,,,,"Langley, John Peter",,,,,,"1997",,,"Children with severe behaviour problems occur in significant numbers in our kindergartens and schools. They have a profound and often destructive effect on those around them because of their high rates of non-compliant, aggressive, and antisocial behaviours.
 In New Zealand, teachers have not traditionally been trained in methods that would enable them to better manage these children and to bring about improvements in their behaviour. This is especially so in early childhood education where the predominant developmental philosophy has resulted in a the rejection of the treatments that research has shown to be most effective in the remediation of antisocial behaviours in young children.
 This thesis examined the training of kindergarten teachers in skills which would enable them to better manage young children with behaviour disorders in the kindergarten setting. An experimental analysis was undertaken in an attempt to identify the necessary components of an effective in-service training programme. The research consisted of a Pilot Study and four subsequent experiments. In the Pilot Study a three level multiple-gating diagnostic procedure was trialled as a procedure for identifying young children with behaviour disorders and a training programme was developed. This consisted of six workshops and the requirement that the teachers practise the skills which they had been taught. The hypothesis which guided the development of this training programme was that it should be easier for teachers to acquire and maintain behaviour management skills due to their history of training for educational practice and, as a result, that a training programme for teachers could be ""looser"" and less directive than the training required for parents. This proved not to be the case. While the teachers in the pilot study were very positive about the training, observational data collected throughout the experiment showed that there were no significant changes in the behaviour of the teachers and, as a consequence, none in the target children.
 Following the failure of the Pilot Study, the training programme was modified to include stronger prompts for desired teacher responses to target children, the setting of specific behaviour change goals for the teachers' behaviour change, and the provision of structured feedback on the teachers' performance. In addition, procedures for the maintenance of newly acquired skills were built into both the training programme and the practice requirements undertaken by the teachers who participated. The relative importance of one of these training components, feedback, was analysed in a series of four experiments each of which was carried out in kindergartens containing at least two children who met the definition of behaviour disordered.
 In all four experiments the teachers who took part were able to acquire and use the management techniques taught during training. Those who showed the greatest levels of improvement were the teachers who, as part of their training and practice, were required to meet a criterion of acceptable performance for their newly acquired management skills, and who were provided with daily feedback on that performance. As a result of the improvements in the management behaviour of the teachers, improvements also occurred in the behaviour of all but one of the target children.
 The results of these experiments suggested that it is possible to change the management behaviour of teachers in an early childhood setting to a level which enables them to effectively manage the behaviour of children with severe behaviour problems provided that the training programme includes well designed cueing, performance criteria, practice, and feedback components.",,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/5914",,,,"en",,,,,"University of Canterbury.

The ways that the culture of learning created in the classroom provides opportunities for students to learn or not learn are explored in two different instructional contexts - science and social studies. The significance of teacher and student behaviour in establishing and maintaining classroom culture is examined. Extensive qualitative and quantitative methods, and comprehensive coding and analyses of data, provide detailed accounts of individual students' experiences within each context. Interview data reveal significant differences between students' and teachers' perspectives on teaching and learning, and in the unique ways individuals experience the classroom.
 Findings contest the notion that differences in the way students learn is the direct result of differences in ability, but suggest that such differences are likely to result from an interactive relationship between academic ability and classroom experience. It is argued that how students learn to learn is primarily a socio-cultural process. Whether a student learns or not depends on their understanding of classroom tasks; their management of social relationships; the extent to which they share the cultural understandings and prior knowledge of the teacher and other students; their social status, and the opportunities they take or create for their own learning. The implications are that in order to increase the effectiveness of classrooms, changes are required in the ways classrooms function. Constructivist principles articulated by teachers need to be implemented in their practice. Opportunities for all students to be agentive in classroom decision-making processes, and the provision of opportunities for cognitive engagement in authentic tasks within an inclusive community of learners, are discussed.",,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/5916",,,,"en",,,,,"University of Canterbury.

 The intervention programme involved a weekly clinic attendance by the child and his/her caregiver at which procedures for stimulating physical, cognitive, language and social growth were demonstrated to the parents. The emphasis was on a parent-professional partnership. The weekly contact also provided opportunities for parents to gain support and understanding from one another as well as to learn about early child development and its relevance for their D.S. infants.
 The study attempted to evaluate the success of the intervention programme by comparing the intervention sample with a contrast group of four D.S. infants born in Queen Mary Hospital, Dunedin, during a comparable time period, together with a close examination of the way the programme worked for the 11 infants and their families in the intervention group.
 Assessments included systematic ongoing evaluation of infant progress in conjunction with more objective procedures and contextual information. By using a number of different instruments the study attempted to sample representative behaviours of both-the child and his caregiver.
 It was possible to show, that for the intervention sample the development of all subjects proceeded in a consistent stepwise pattern from birth to 2 ½ years of age.
 Although individual differences were apparent during the period of intervention, by the completion of the study all children had acquired mobility and the beginnings of language and personal social skills. Levels of cognitive competence were assessed as being only slightly behind those of normal children.

In the context of the neo-Liberal restructuring of the state sector that occurred throughout the 1980s, the formation of this group was a political anomaly. The expulsion of 'vested interests' from the education sector, as in other public sectors, was a significant theme of the reorganisation of the administration of education. Yet the Schools Consultative Group, as a collection of education sector interest groups, was invited by the Minister of Education to advise him on matters of policy. While appearing to function as a consultative forum, it is argued in this thesis that the need for such a group arose out of the structural inadequacies of the neo-Liberal state form. More particularly, the struggle in education, which had reached critical proportions by 1992, was precipitated by the structural exclusion of education sector groups as 'vested interests'. The transformation of both modes of interest representation and intervention in the education state generated a structural crisis which was manifested in the form of a political crisis of support for continued educational reform. It is suggested here that the Schools Consultative Group represented a political strategy to contain the education crisis and to remove from the public arena a very public conflict between the Minister of Education and the teachers' unions over the direction of education policy.",,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/5917",,,,"en",,,,,"University of Canterbury.

"6355","10092/806",,,,,"Quinlivan, Kathleen Anne",,,,,,"2002",,,"This thesis explores what's possible in terms of affirming sexual diversity in two New Zealand case study schools, Takehe High School and Kereru Girls' College, between 1996 and 1998. The research process was characterised by a number of shifts that arose in the interests of theoretical width and also because of methodological necessity.
 Initially the research project was developed within an affirmative action model. However over time, the study increasingly became informed by Foncauldian, queer and feminist post-structural frameworks. These theoretical paradigms provided a way to move beyond framing lesbian and gay students in schools as a disadvantaged minority group with personal deficits. The frameworks were also helpful in focusing on the ways in which heteronormative discourses are produced and destabilised within the two case study schools.
 In addition, Foucauldian, queer and feminist post-structural frameworks provided ways to explore the complex and mutable nature of sexuality, and possible pedagogical directions for students to be able to explore the discursive construction of sexuality and gender in the classroom. Foucauldian analytical tools such as genealogy also proved helpful in accounting for the constraints that arose in the second case study school because of the presence of the project in the school.
 The final stage of the research process led to what I am describing as an informed action approach. Foucauldian, queer and feminist post-structural frameworks may provide helpful (if challenging) directions in terms of addressing sexual diversity within the formal curriculum. However, I also suggest that affirming sexual diversity in schools should also involve having an understanding of the ideological, structural and micro and macro contextual constraints that will arise when issues of sexual diversity are explored within school contexts. This joint approach may go some way to ensuring that action to affirm sexual diversity in schools can be well informed.",,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/5918",,,,"en",,,,,"University of Canterbury.

"6344","10092/806",,,"Nacagilevu, Jenna Evelyn",,,,,,,,"2010",,,"There are notable differences between the dominant Western medical model of health and the model of CAM, and looking at these differences may provide a greater understanding around doctors’ views towards CAM and its place in the wider health system.  
The purpose of this dissertation is to provide a systematic literature review into how doctors view complementary and alternative medicine, and to see if this has changed since the 1970s through to 2009.  A systematic review of the literature was conducted, mainly using online original research Journal articles from medical databases.  The internet was the main tool used in locating data, and literature was included or excluded based on relevance.  This was evaluated on the relevance of time period, such as 1970, subject, such as chiropractic, or theme, such as attitudes of doctors to CAM.

Literature from the 1970s was scarce on this research question, but this review noted a significant increase in literature on this topic since the 1990s, identifying this research area as a relatively new field of study, with much potential for further exploration into beliefs and attitudes of doctors towards CAM.
Scientific research papers that were published highlighted a strong emphasis towards doctors’ requirement for further scientific research on the efficacy of CAM.  Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) were the preferred method of testing; however this review also discusses appropriate methodology to test both CAM and doctors’ views and beliefs.

The difference between the Western medical model and the CAM model highlights the differences between both concepts; from which this author provides a possible interpretation of doctors’ indifferent views towards CAM using the psychological theory of cognitive dissonance (Festinger, 1957).  This theory suggests that a person cannot hold two conflicting beliefs simultaneously, without the presence of cognitive ‘dissonance.’  “The existence of dissonance, being psychologically uncomfortable, will motivate the person to try to reduce the dissonance and achieve consonance” (Festinger, 3: 1957).  This systematic review then provides a discussion around how this could explain doctors’ views towards CAM.
.
This then leads to the question of whether ‘successful integration of Western medicine and CAM is therefore possible’?  The systematic review concludes with the highlighting of important issues in regard to the study design and methodology on effectively testing CAM, and on effectively testing doctors’ beliefs: also, the issues around integration and further scientific literature on CAM in a bid to potentially reduce the ‘moderate tone of answering’ that is reported in the literature in regard to doctors’ views towards CAM.",,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/5896",,,,"en",,,,,"University of Canterbury.

"6437","10092/806",,,"Perry, Lane Graves",,,,,,,,"2011",,,"The purpose of this study is to more clearly understand what student' experience while involved in service-learning courses. Moreover, I sought to identify the relationships among service-learning, the outcomes typically attributed to it, and student engagement according to Naturalistic Inquiry methodology (Lincoln & Guba, 1985) and quantitative data from the Australasian Survey of Student Engagement (2009-2010) in two different upper-division courses at the University of Canterbury in New Zealand during the second semester of the 2009 academic year. One class approached service-learning in an addendum/add-on type of approach (Approach I service-learning), while the other course used a more fully-integrated approach (Approach II service-learning).

The theoretical framework offered by the philosophy of experiential education (Dewey) and the theories of experiential learning (Kolb), transformative learning (Mezirow), and student engagement (Kuh) combine to serve as the lens through which service-learning was initially viewed in this study. This framework provided the initial structure by which this study was facilitated and the relationship between service-learning and its typically attributed outcomes could be observed and better understood within a New Zealand tertiary environment.

The student experiences within Approach I and II service-learning served as sources for pursuing a greater level of sophistication and understanding of how these experiences influence the relationships of service-learning and ultimately how service-learning influences student engagement. Such an investigation is relevant to New Zealand tertiary teachers, researchers, and leaders, who are interested in creating conditions that engage students in learning while developing students personally and involving them within the local community. For transferability purposes, the goal of this study is to provide enough “thick description” (Lincoln & Guba, 1985, p. 125) in the case of each approach to service-learning so that educators from New Zealand and the rest of the world can find meaning, value, and direction.

Quantitative findings from this study clearly demonstrated a statistically significant shift in student engagement benchmarks in both approaches to service-learning (3 of 6 AUSSE benchmarks in Approach I service-learning and 6 of 6 AUSSE benchmarks in Approach II service-learning). Qualitative data provided the means to suggest why these significant shifts occurred and illuminated the complexity of the student experience within service-learning environments. Qualitatively, both approaches to service-learning shifted the context of what it meant to be a student in a classroom. The following themes symbolize the different experiences and demonstrate ways teachers can best engage both eager and reluctant learners:  different experiences-providing opportunities for growth; consistently being a part of something-internal/external to university; active-learning through experiencing and thinking for yourself; worthwhile, intrinsic-due to helping community organisations.

Considering the effects of service-learning on engagement have been relatively un-researched in New Zealand higher education and further inquiry into the pedagogical consequences has been warranted, the implications may provide insight into the development of service-learning in higher education for New Zealand, Australasia, and potentially, the world.",,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/5991",,,,"en",,,,,"University of Canterbury.

The study investigated whether change occurred in the assessment for learning processes of a kindergarten after establishing a webpage.  The study was carried out in a nonprofit state owned kindergarten where children aged 3-5 years attended.  The participants were three children and their families and three of the teachers from the kindergarten.  The data was collected using narrative observations, questionnaires, semi-structured interviews and a field diary. The data was collected over three phases over a six month period.  Phase A - before the webpage, Phase B - during the set up of the webpage and Phase C - after the webpage had been in use for three months. The data was analysed during and after each phase and drawn together at the end of the study to present the stories of the participants.  Basic content analysis was used to look for reoccurring themes or patterning as well as any contradictions or dissimilar views.

The findings suggest that the webpage (ICT) provided some benefits such as a more convenient way of accessing information for some family members and extended family/whānau, extra opportunities for children to revisit their learning and to be active participants in building new collaborative knowledge.  The findings identified that the webpage was not as accessible to children as their learning portfolios and that the value of the webpage, as a tool for accessing assessment for learning, was different for each of the families and the teachers.",,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/5567",,,,"en",,,,,"University of Canterbury.

In 2008, the New Zealand Ministry of Health, after the completion a trial of the interRAI – Home Care assessment tool in the District Health Board, rolled out implementation of the interRAI – Home Care tool throughout New Zealand’s 21 District Health Boards. The Quality of Life survey itself is currently being assessed and trialled throughout the world as a follow-up to the Home Care assessment. It will enable researchers and assessors to enable for a comprehensive perspective by bringing together the views of both service providers and recipients of care service. The assessments will be completed by the person directly, as a self assessment, or through interview 

The overall research aim of the study itself is to evaluate the adequacy of the interRAI Quality of Life survey in assessing the Quality of Life issues and needs of the elderly living in their own homes in the community with some sort of publicly funded health care, social or community support such as meals on wheels, personal care, etc., for the purpose of demonstrating the importance of it as a useful tool within New Zealand. 

The objectives of the research are as follows:

•	Objective 1 - To review the management and application of quality of life indicators for the elderly. 
•	Objective 2 – To understand the pressures which an ageing population places on public policy.   
•	Objective 3 - To consider how quality of life measures can best be applied alongside interRAI in New Zealand.

The research itself focused on the Quality of Life of thirty participants. Each participant was first assessed through an interRAI – HC assessment at their own home by an assessor from the Canterbury District Health Board. Upon completion of the assessment, they were given the option of being contacted by the researcher about participation in the interRAI Quality of Life Survey. Contact by the researcher by telephone ensued, which was then followed up by a face to face information session at the home of the participant. At this time, thirty out of thirty one potential participants decided to sign the informed consent form for participation. As the Quality of Life Survey itself is self reported, each participant was free to read through the survey and answer for themselves questions regarding their thoughts about their own quality of life. 

Participants responded to forty six statements from nine different domains on the Quality of Life Survey. Overall results showed a majority of responses of ‘Always’, which were positive. Areas of concern which emerged from the data were of possible issues of social isolation and unresolved emotional health. 

Limitations of the research included factors such as the small sample size of thirty, the geography of the study which was limited to Christchurch, and the fact that there was no follow up visit to the first and only interview.

In conclusion, it is apparent that a larger trial throughout the District Health Board is required to overcome the aforementioned limitations of sample size and geography. Also, it is imperative that a follow-up visit is scheduled after the initial visit to allow for intervention into quality of life issues which emerge from the participant’s self-assessment.",,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/5758",,,,"en",,,,,"University of Canterbury.

"6160","10092/806",,,"Flanagan, Kerren Bernadette",,,,,,,,"2011",,,"Advances in workplace based physical activity programmes have been observed worldwide, however, minimal research has been carried out on workplace based programmes in New Zealand. Physical activity is an important modifiable risk factor for conditions such as CVD, diabetes mellitus, and obesity. Physical inactivity is a significant risk factor, approximately half of New Zealand adults are recorded as physically inactive. Promoting health in the workplace increases the chances of health and well-being. Studies on workplaces that incorporate health and wellness initiatives including physical activity programmes, demonstrate lower health care costs and absenteeism and an overall improvement in physical and mental health, job performance, motivation and productivity.
This study examined the self-reported physical activity outcomes obtained by a sub group of individuals who participated in the 2007 Sea 2 Sea Challenge, and the extent of support provided by their workplace. The Sea 2 Sea Challenge is a six-week workplace physical activity initiative run annually in Christchurch, by Sport Canterbury, which is now in its seventh year.
This study is based on data gathered during and after the Sea 2 Sea Challenge. Both individual and workplace data were obtained on participation in, and impact of, the programme. A self-report physical activity chart was filled out by individual participants in the programme. Online and paper questionnaires were also sent to each workplace and filled out by the workplace coordinator, including information on workplace support. Over the study period 3,732 individuals from 114 workplaces participated in the Sea 2 Sea Challenge. Of the 3,732 total participants, 688 (18.4%) participants filled out and returned the self-report physical activity cards and 54 out of 114 (47.4%) workplace coordinators completed the online/paper questionnaire. These data were subsequently analysed using SPSS software and issues examined include factors associated with levels of individual and workplace participation and the extent to which workplaces supported the Sea 2 Sea programme.
Some key findings include: The Sea 2 Sea Challenge has maintained a steady increase in the number of workplaces taking part each year since 2004. From 2005 to 2007, there was approximately a 30% increase in workplaces participating each year. Of the participants who completed the physical activity self-report chart, 70% met the recommended level of activity of 30 minutes each day over six weeks, despite the often low levels of support provided by the workplace and/or workplace
coordinator. Although the programme is only short term, the Sea 2 Sea Challenge demonstrates the potential of the programme as a successful workplace intervention in the Canterbury region, particularly for a sub-group of people that reported high levels of physical activity. From the perspective of health promotion targeted to the working population this is a significant and low cost short term outcome for a substantial group. However, the long-term effects of the intervention are not known.
The study affirms the potential value of the workplace as a useful setting for health promotion and has also indicated the need for a more extensive evaluation of the effectiveness of such a workplace based health promotion programme. The strengths and the limitations of this study are discussed along with implications for successful implementation of workplace based physical activity programmes in general.",,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/5698",,,,"en",,,,,"University of Canterbury.

Findings of this study show that Bangladeshi school leaders have vision for school
improvement. They lead their schools with managerial and democratic styles of leadership.
They work for professional development inside the school with a view to improve the
teaching and learning process. Students’ achievement is their ultimate goal. They work under
pressure with their skill of handling different kinds of adverse situation like bureaucratic

for creating environments that engage these learners through opportunities to learn
within their areas of interest. I present three students and their teachers as case studies
and use a collaborative process for change to negotiate possibilities for engaged
learning. This collaborative process for change is a framework for reflexive inquiry. It
explores the use of Problem Based Methodology (Robinson & Lai, 2006) to frame
conversations that lead to the negotiation of learning pathways with hidden gifted
students, teachers and their Resource Teacher Learning and Behaviour. Through
collective, critical reflection and analysis of identified theories of action (Argyris &
Schon, 1978), learners, teachers and resource teacher gained a deeper understanding
of the social and emotional characteristics of hidden gifted and the way inclusive
practices influenced engagement.
The understandings that have emerged from this research are grounded in collective
praxis. Praxis is informed by reflexivity, a process of describing, informing,
dialoguing and reconstructing. It is a process of disequilibrium whereby praxitioners
(Mayo, 2003) are critically aware and in tune with multiple ways of knowing, seeking
inclusive understandings and practices that continually challenge personal beliefs and
values. In this way five outcomes have emerged from this research. Firstly there has
been a developing possibility for untangling the complexities of engagement through
reflexive processes for identifying and mapping action theories. This mapping is
respectful of voice and enables the emergence of pathways for transformative change.
Secondly, there has been an emerging understanding of reflexivity and how reflexive
processes contribute to change. Thirdly we have explored the dynamics of reengagement
for hidden gifted learners. Fourthly there has been the emergence of a
process for facilitating collective praxis to engage teachers and learners in reflexive
processes for shifting thinking beyond the descriptive to more informative and
transformative reflection. Finally, the participatory action research methodology
guiding this research has emerged as a possibility for a framework of practice for
RTLB. This framework may resolve issues of philosophical difference related to
inclusive paradigms and positions RTLB on a learning trajectory toward praxitioner
research and the development of a critical pedagogy.",,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/6192",,,,"en",,,,,"University of Canterbury.

Towards this goal, I approach the theory and empirical data in this study in ways that create opportunities for researching teachers’ emotions that other approaches do not: I examine patterns, commonality and relationships across conditions and over time to reveal within-person differences, and differences between persons, for Julia and Lydia’s emotional practice. In addition, I outline discursive models of analysis that open up the space for investigating the role of teachers’ emotions in ways that other conceptual and methodological frameworks do not: I expand models of analysis to different descriptive and classificatory systems to maintain the integrity of the object. I bring together multiple theoretical perspectives to build a multilevel theory that provides comprehensive insight into teachers’ emotions. I also specify the nature of interactions between levels, for the multilevel theory, to enable cross-validation and cumulative evidence building. The research findings for this study coincide with and expand upon the findings for previous studies on teachers’ emotions. Julia’s emotions interact with her science teaching in powerful ways and realize an emotional practice of strong feelings, and ‘grand’ narratives. In contrast, Lydia’s emotions interact with her science teaching in ways that promote solidarity and realize an emotional practice of graded feelings, and multiple narratives. I extend upon the language of description in this study to take into account the teachers’ meaning-making relevant to their appraisal processes and emotions. The potential for research into teachers’ emotions is expanded in this study through the synthesis of different descriptive and classificatory systems, and categories.

"7053","10092/806",,,,,"Salahuddin, Abu Nayeem Mohammad",,,,,,"2011",,,"Studies on school leadership show that effective leadership is basic to successful school development and improvement of teaching and learning. Secondary schools in Bangladesh depend on principals as their leaders. Since Bangladesh is now facing the challenge of reforms in secondary education, principals need to acquire current knowledge of leadership theory and research to give them the theoretical understandings of leadership approaches that are likely to make their schools more successful. The purpose of this study was to explore how principals of Bangladesh understand leadership theory and the extent to which they use the distributed leadership approach. It also investigated their leadership practice in their school contexts, including how they engage their teachers in leadership activities.
The participants in this study were the principals and twenty teachers from four secondary schools in Dhaka city of Bangladesh. The schools were selected from ten upper ranked schools of Dhaka city based on the Secondary School Certificate (SSC) examination in the academic year 2009-2010. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with the principals and a survey was completed by the teachers. The findings show that the principals have adequate experiential knowledge for leading their schools; most of their leadership skills have been developed through experience and are focussed on pedagogical leadership. However, they lack theoretical knowledge of different approaches and concepts of school leadership, as they have not had opportunities for formal leadership training programmes. The survey result indicates that there is some practice of distributed leadership in the schools.
The findings of this study have implications for the development of secondary school leadership in Bangladesh. They suggest that professional leadership programmes should be provided for principals of secondary schools and principals should have increased self-management in the administration of their schools. Teachers are keen to broaden their participation in leadership activities. The recommendations from this study could lead to more effective leadership in Bangladeshi secondary schools.",,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/6587",,,,"en",,,,,"University of Canterbury.

"8162","10092/806",,,"Cody, Tracey-Lynne",,,,,,,,"2013",,,"This research investigates drama teaching practice in New Zealand primary and secondary schools, through a case-based qualitative inquiry into the practice of six experienced drama teachers.  The study reveals that whilst drama education is couched within the Arts learning area of the national curriculum, the educational philosophy enacted by participants encompasses a broad vision for drama education, which extends learning beyond a technical knowledge of theatre and theatre-making towards the domains of social and personal meaning-making and emancipatory knowledge.  Explored through the lenses of Artist and Co-artist, the study identifies the socio-cultural nature of the practice of these teachers. Teachers’ artistry is revealed through creative use of drama tools and processes to create aesthetically-rich learning experiences. The significance of relational pedagogy to teaching and learning in these drama classrooms is also examined within the study. Teachers’ accounts reveal the ways they seek to develop interpersonal relationships with and between students, and establish ensemble-based approaches to learning in drama. As co-artists, participants employ pedagogies that empower students to actively participate in a community of drama practice, intentionally developing students’ capacities for collaboration, creativity and critical thinking, while discovering and developing their artistic-aesthetic capabilities. These teachers share power with students through acts of negotiation, creating dialogic learning opportunities in order to develop student agency as artists and citizens. Attempts to navigate tensions that arise due to increased performativity pressures on teachers and to avoid prescriptive and technocratic delivery of drama curriculum are also explored. In-depth interviews were conducted with participants to discover the complexities of their teaching practice, the philosophy of drama education they hold, and the decisions they make in curriculum content and pedagogy. Observations of classroom practice were also undertaken, along with an analysis of planning documents and an interview with their students. The study provides six rich case studies of drama practice in New Zealand schools, contributing to local and international understandings of enacted drama education within school settings.

As the participants talk about their own and other people‟s art works they are formulating and expressing aesthetic responses and beginning to shape their individual aesthetic awareness. Because of the age of the participants, the exploration is framed in terms of “what makes art good”.
The research was prompted by the introduction and implementation of the New Zealand Curriculum (2007), which not only positions art as a core area of learning, but also outlines values and key competencies that characterise a constructivist approach to knowledge. Such an approach requires active engagement by learners and suggests that it is important for teachers to understand their students‟ values and views. However, in the field of art education there is little published material that examines the views and reactions of students. A broadly qualitative approach to the case study was taken, drawing particularly on phenomenography and narrative.
The study found that 10-12 year-old students do actively make judgements about art works, and while there are common themes that occur repeatedly, the bases of such judgement vary from student to student. The study also found students‟ ways of approaching art-making varied, with some, for example, concerned predominantly with the technical process while others were more interested in imagery or narrative intention.
The thesis argues that it is important for teachers to be aware of how their students individually process their aesthetic responses in order to develop relevant and appropriate programmes.",,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/5751",,,,"en",,,,,"University of Canterbury.

"6186","10092/806",,,"Kabir, Md. Ariful Haq",,,,,,,,"2011",,,"A new phase of higher education in Bangladesh begun in the 1990s in which a remarkable transformation took place in the higher education system, largely based on market-driven economic forces. The government promulgated the Private University Act in 1992, which has been recently repealed in order to enact the new Private University Act 2010. It formulated a twenty-year Strategic Plan for Higher Education 2006-2026 (SPHE) in 2006. Consequently economic as well as political goals became drivers of the higher education system. This transformation informs a set of changes in the higher education sector. Often higher education institutions rely on private investment and the education they offer is shaped in line with the demands of global markets. This thesis explores the degree to which neoliberalism is a prominent feature of the higher education sector in Bangladesh, and the perception of key stakeholders about the influence of hegemonic neoliberal policy on their academic goals. 
This research is analytic and qualitative in nature. The overall approach is one of critical analysis, applying what is discussed in the international literature about neolibralisism to the higher education sector in Bangladesh. In the first instance I analysed documents from policy makers, commentators and news reporters in Bangladesh and related these to concepts in the internationals discussion of monetarism, global market economy and neolibralism. I then turned to a range of key participants in the sector itself and sought their perceptions through interview in order to fill out the initial document analysis and to ground this discussion in the experiences and understandings of people involved in the sector. The data from these interviews is accompanied by an analysis of further documents relating to the participants’ specific workplaces and once again aligned to the international discourse.
The views of participants were sought through interview. A total of twenty-one participants were interviewed under six categories: the University Grant Commission (UGC) and government officials, owners of private universities, politicians and student activists, public and private university authorities and faculty members, education expert and sociologists, and public and private university students. In addition, I searched and analysed a range of documents as further tools for examining the context of the neoliberal agenda within higher education. 
The findings are structured into four subsections: neoliberal hegemony and ideological transformation of higher education, neoliberalism and knowledge-based economy, neoliberalism in the higher education sector and its structural consequences, and neoliberalism and resistance. The findings suggested that the neoliberal shift in the higher education sector in Bangladesh explicitly changes the overall socio-cultural, political and economical patterns of society. Not only are philosophical and pedagogical aspects of higher education changed through neoliberal policy agenda, but higher education also becomes a most expensive commodity in contemporary Bangladesh. Private universities have evolved with an underlying notion of privatisation of higher education, and the process of marketisation of higher education leads to a vocationalisation of higher education. The notion of 'academic entrepreneur' contributes to the development of discriminatory attitudes between students, and between teachers. Profit motivated higher education is adversely impacting on the critical insight of the young generation. The neoliberal policy shift within higher education sector is also leading to large-scale violence in higher education institutions.",,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/5752",,,,"en",,,,,"University of Canterbury.

"6088","10092/806",,,"Elgin, Joanna Elizabeth",,,,,,,,"2010",,,"The global burden of disease attributable to mental illness is high, and as a result people with serious mental illness are at greater risk of indicators of social exclusion, such as poverty, homelessness and social isolation. Since deinstitutionalisation began in the 1960s, a variety of housing and support models have been used for this group. „Housing first‟ models are proving superior to „continuum of care‟ models in achieving positive housing outcomes and improving indicators of social exclusion. Housing first programmes are also believed to be more effective as they offer consumers choice, are not contingent on treatment, and are, therefore, empowering and philosophically compatible with harm reduction and recovery approaches. The physical and social environments have also been found to influence housing satisfaction and well-being outcomes for this group, but are often poorly measured or inadequately defined in the few studies which have been conducted.
As little recent New Zealand research has examined housing, support and environmental effects for people with serious mental illness, this twelve-month prospective cohort study provides a more current account of the experiences of this group. Thirty six participants were recruited from a group of people with serious mental illness referred to the Comcare Housing Service for assistance to obtain independent, community-based housing. An examination of the variables influencing housing and overall well-being ratings was conducted. Peace and Kell's (2001) sustainability framework, outlining four categories of resources required for this group to maintain housing, was also evaluated.
The results demonstrate the success of housing support in improving outcomes for people with serious mental illness, particularly in terms of improved housing quality and satisfaction, and residential stability. They also provide further evidence that this group have high rates of homelessness and are frequently in situations where they are at risk of homelessness. The physical environment appeared to have little influence on housing satisfaction or other well-being measures, however, the social environment seemed to play a role in higher ratings on these outcomes. Participants rehoused by Comcare Housing reported higher housing satisfaction and fewer housing problems, indicating that the service was providing effective housing support.
Peace and Kell‟s framework is a good model for conceptualising housing for this group, although environmental and neighbourhood effects need to be included in the model in order for it to have international applicability. The omission of those at risk of homelessness from the New Zealand definition is a serious concern and has policy implications as support to address housing issues for this group may be neglected due to their invisibility in the statistics.",,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/5658",,,,"en",,,,,"University of Canterbury.

"6660","10092/806",,,"Alexander-Pouono, Judy-Anne",,,,,,,,"2010",,,"Concerns and issues facing achievement in literacy are not new, particularly in developing
countries. The challenge in Samoa is that many children speak the Samoan language in
their everyday communication with families, friends, villages and the wider society.
However, in Year Four, they are introduced to English as a subject and this continues until
they are ready for secondary school, when, all formal examinations in schools and
universities with the exception of Samoan, are conducted in English.
The small island nation is preparing to be a greater part of the world stage, as its people
get ready to expand their horizons through migration, regional and international exchanges
of employment, and further interest in the tourism market to improve its economy and
foreign exchange earnings. As a result, the need for improved literacy and competency in
English is becoming more apparent.
This means that children will need as much assistance in improving their literacy levels as
is possible, to support their learning at primary, secondary, and tertiary levels and as they
choose careers. One way of doing this can be the establishment of community literacy
centres that operate outside of school hours. This research reports on one of these centres.
The Centre was selected based on its years of operation, the manner of its organisation, the
service that it offered, and the successful results that it appeared to be having with its
clientele. The principal purpose of the study was to identify the role of the centre, observe
its operation closely and recommend whether or not the model could be copied to another
setting under similar circumstances and at the same time achieve comparable results.
Qualitative data was gathered from semi-structured interviews with the facilitator, both
face-to-face and telephone (to clarify any points), observations of the programme at the
centre, individual interviews with the students and finally a focus group interview with
parents. The findings show that with a committed and informed facilitator or leader, an
organised programme, regular reading hours, capable teachers or assistants, a ‘print
saturated environment’(Duffy, 2003, MOE, 2003, MOE 2006, Pressley, 2002,) with a
variety of books designed to attract children, and a safe, non-threatening environment,
school age children could improve their literacy levels and engagement in reading. The
conclusion indicates that centres similar to this one can be set up in other villages in Samoa to
assist children with improving their literacy skills in English and hopefully their future outcomes.",,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/6232",,,,"en",,,,,"University of Canterbury.

The present study explored this hypothesis with regard to the development of mathematical skills. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether the delays of children who are delayed in mathematical development are in part due to a lack of skill, particularly a lack of fluency, in particular component skills. Performance on several component skills was investigated: The ability to read and write numbers, to recognise quantities and equality, and to perform simple and more complex operations. Performance of each of these skills was compared in two groups of Year 4 and 5 (8-9 year old) children: a group of typically developing children and a group of children showing delayed development in mathematics. Children whose mathematical development was delayed were likely to be less fluent at performing each of the component skills tested than children whose development was typical. Additionally, children whose development was delayed were more likely to have low levels of fluency in several of the component skills.

"11894","10092/806",,,"Jamieson, Sandra",,,,,,,,"2015",,,"This thesis focuses attention on the ongoing effects of the earthquakes on children in Christchurch. It identifies the learning and behavioural difficulties evident in an increasing number of students and cautions the use of the word 'resilient' to describe children who may be just managing. This assumption has a significant impact on the wellbeing of many Christchurch children who, disaster literature warns, are likely to be under-served. This thesis suggests that, because of the scale of need, schools are the best place to introduce practices that will foster wellbeing.

Mindfulness practices are identified as a potential tool for ameliorating the vulnerabilities experienced by children, while at the same time working to increase their capabilities. This thesis argues that, through mindful practices, children can learn to be more reflective of their emotions and respond in more considered ways to different situations. They can become more relational, having a greater understanding of others through a deeper understanding of themselves, and they can build resilience by developing the protective factors that promote more adaptive functioning.

This thesis identifies the strong links between mindfulness and the holistic wellbeing concept of Te Whare Tapa Whã and a Mãori worldview. Strong links are also identified with the vision, values and key competencies of the New Zealand Curriculum and 21st Century learners.

Both short and long term recommendations are made for the introduction of mindfulness practices in schools to enhance the wellbeing of children.

"10025","10092/806",,,"Fitzgerald, Laurel Jean",,,,,,,,"2013",,,"Sustainability education is a contested field in Aotearoa New Zealand, as it is in other countries. A variety of philosophical and theoretical interpretations and possibilities for practice therefore co-exist within this emerging field. This thesis develops a ‘complex perspective’ of sustainability education by exploring the way it is conceptualised in literature and the New Zealand curriculum, and interpreted in practice in the context of a New Zealand secondary school. Guided by the key contributing theories and a qualitative methodology, the thesis maps the complexity of the field from the macro- or global and international level to the micro- or local level using the reference points of theory, practice, and possibility. 

Developed during and in response to an intense period of social and environmental change that shows no signs of abating, the thesis comprises two interrelated components. The first and more substantial component is the literature review. This takes account of situational factors that are giving rise to different conceptions and approaches to sustainability education and to contrasting views presented in literature and curriculum. Used as an umbrella term for all forms of education with environmental and sustainability foci, ‘sustainability education’ (in whatever form it takes) stands as an admission of broad social failure and the need for substantial change. Conceptions of sustainability education range from ‘education for sustainable development’ (ESD), which is advanced by the United Nations and other influential international organisations, to ‘education for sustainability’ (EfS), which has taken precedence over ‘environmental education’ (EE) in the New Zealand curriculum. The literature shows that this complex, contested, contextualised and emerging field is as much hopeful as it is critical.

The qualitative case study comprises the second interrelated component of the thesis. Grounded in the real-life context of a secondary school with a distinctive approach to teaching and learning, it involves an empirical investigation of the ways in which two teachers and a diverse group of Year 9 to Year 14 students understand and practice sustainability education. This component draws on the interpretive methods of interviewing and observation to afford an empathetic and multi-perspectival view of sustainability education in practice. The case does not strive to establish ‘truth’ but rather to be open to multiple truths, realities and meanings - in a manner that is consistent with the theories of social constructionism and interpretivism in particular. 

It is suggested, through this study, that sustainability education cannot be confined to a stable conception or consistent framework, or approached through a programme of standardised levels and assessments. Representing a complex, multi-dimensional, dynamic and emergent concept, sustainability education may best be approached and sustained in a corresponding fashion, through multiple, critically-informed, and dialogically-linked points of entry.",,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/9044",,,,"en",,,,,"University of Canterbury.

"5686","10092/806",,,"Macartney, Bernadette Christine",,,,,,,,"2011",,,"This qualitative study is based on the narratives of two families who each parent a young disabled child. It focuses on the children’s and families’ experiences of inclusion and exclusion within educational settings and the implications of these experiences for pedagogical change. New Zealand’s policy and curriculum contexts are considered in relation to education, disability and inclusion. I examine how the families’ perspectives and experiences interact with dominant, deficit discourses of disability. In my interpretation of the family narratives I identify particular disciplinary mechanisms that operate as tools and tactics of disabling power-knowledge production (Foucault, 1977, 1980). I argue that the policing of disabled children and families’ participation are primary processes and outcomes of these disciplinary mechanisms. 
	The study uses a Disability Studies in Education (DSE) framework to understand and approach disability as socially, politically and culturally constructed. The assumptions underlying traditional Western educational knowledge and norms are critiqued from a counter-narrative based on experiences of disability. I use DSE research and literature to challenge knowledge regimes that interpret disability as an individual deficit requiring ‘special’ intervention and treatment. I argue that a ‘disability critique’ makes an important contribution to understanding the workings and effects of Western, Eurocentric knowledge traditions on children and families. This research further argues that exclusion is experienced by those within and outside of the dominant culture.
	I envisage the main research audience of this thesis to be early childhood and primary school teachers, teacher educators, early intervention and special education personnel, therapists and medical professionals. The stories and experiences of the families in this research may support teachers and other professionals to critically reflect on, and make changes to their thinking and practices. I hope to contribute to the growing body of research that can be used to support parents and families of disabled children in their efforts to promote educational change and to support the full inclusion of their children as valued people and learners within their educational contexts.
	I develop two main arguments in this research. The first is that in order to transform education, deficit discourses and their effects must be named and understood. The second is that New Zealand educationalists can build on existing, local frameworks to develop critical, narrative and relational pedagogies to transform exclusionary power relations and support inclusive experiences for all children and their families. I argue that approaches to disability and education based on a belief that exclusion is ‘inevitable’ and that creating a fully inclusive education system and society is an impossible dream, should be challenged and rejected. A lack of optimism and vision reproduces exclusion, and leads to weak reforms at best. Disabled children and their families deserve and have a right to an inclusive life and education and this requires people at all levels of society to take responsibility.",,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/5307",,,,"en",,,,,"University of Canterbury.

This qualitative study, based on narrative inquiry, presents case studies of six participants from six different countries, languages and cultures. The findings point to challenges faced by pre-service teacher education students from other languages and cultures. Tensions created by language difficulties, new pedagogies and social and educational cultural differences lead to feelings, at times, of disorientation, heightened “otherness” and unease. Students who are crossing the border between one culture and pedagogical belief system to another require specific support.
This study did, however, find evidence of students developing new understandings about teaching and learning. The findings carry implications for the content, delivery and pedagogy of Initial Teacher Education programmes. The introduction of a Foundation Course and a Support Group, modelling of good practice by ITE lecturers using a variety of interactive teaching strategies and targeted reflective practices are suggested. 
In a time of teacher shortages, changing demographics in schools and the changing nature of university-based ITE it is important that the assumption that one size fits all in ITE all needs to be put aside.

Since the beginning of this century, a number of governments have legislated for the rights of patients and to protect these rights. This reflects the emergence of a new focus on consumers and promoting patient-centred care. Despite the large number of studies dealing with aspects of patient rights, few have examined the readiness of hospitals to implement patient rights concepts or establish a positive culture of patient rights.

Research aims
This research project aimed to establish the perceptions of key stakeholders (experts, managers, doctors, nurses, and patients) regarding the implementation of the Patient’s Bill of Rights in public hospitals in Saudi Arabia. The specific objectives were to determine the factors facilitating and hindering implementation and examine the actual implementation of patient rights in selected Saudi public hospitals.

Methods
A “positive culture for patient rights framework” (PCPR) was developed and used as the conceptual framework for designing the research and discussing its findings. The framework reflects three levels of activity: macro (health system), meso (community and healthcare organisations) and micro (professionals and patients). A mixed-methods design was employed, comprising cross-sectional surveys and key informant interviews. A random sample of 292 doctors, 550 nurses, and 334 hospitalised patients were surveyed, using a self-administered questionnaire. The surveys were conducted in seven large hospitals in the capital, Riyadh. In addition, in-depth interviews with nine managers and experts in the field of patient rights were conducted. Survey data was analysed using descriptive and inferential statistics, with thematic analysis adopted for analysing the key informant interviews. Statistical and thematic analysis findings were integrated and discussed together.

Findings
Findings reveal shortcomings in public hospitals and among professionals, preventing effective implementation of the Patient’s Bill of Rights. There was low commitment from hospital management, possibly reflecting the failure of the Ministry of Health to transfer their commitment to hospitals. Other shortcomings included the absence of publicity about the Bill, the low involvement of professionals and patients, and the failure to request their feedback. Obstacles to professionals implementing the Bill include increased work pressure, low levels of job satisfaction, insufficient numbers of staff in public hospitals, lack of public awareness about the Bill, and the lack of authority given to staff of the Patient Rights and Relations Departments. Patient Rights and Relations Departments were seen as supporting the implementation of the Bill. The data highlighted the importance of managerial factors in success, such as creating a safe work environment, supporting teamwork values, publicising the Bill, clarifying the regulations, undertaking coordination between different organisations, creating an effective complaint system, providing advocacy services, and implementing an effective monitoring mechanism. The rights most respected were maintaining personal privacy, preserving patients’ information, and treating patients in a safe environment. The rights least implemented were explaining the complaint procedures and giving patients copies of the Bill.

Conclusions
In the field of patient rights, this research is the first to examine different aspects of the implementation of the Bill in Saudi Arabia. The findings draw attention to the gap in commitment between senior management at the Ministry level and hospital management and revealed the ongoing difficulty of transferring commitment from one management level to another. The findings emphasise that creating a positive culture for patient rights requires more serious and effective managerial commitment, as well as the activation of the role of community. The current research was able to identify contributing and hindering factors, which provide clarity concerning options for improving the implementation process. The research provides solutions to address many challenges in the implementation process such as to legislate clear strategies that support and strengthen community participation, and insure the effective involvement of all stakeholders. It is necessary to increase the awareness of professionals, the public, and patients by providing training and education through the effective use of classic and modern media. Support from the Ministry of Health is crucial. More emphasis should be placed on policy implementation and evaluation on an ongoing basis. Effective collaboration between different governmental and non-governmental bodies is essential for promoting the Bill on multiple levels. Continuous improvements are recommended, including regular follow-up and evaluation.

Further research is recommended to examine the roles of educational institutions in promoting the implementation of the Bill, and to examine the perceptions of minority groups who have particular needs or illnesses.",,,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/14972",,,"en","English",,,,"University of Canterbury",,,,,,,"http://library.canterbury.ac.nz/thesis/etheses_copyright.shtml","All Rights Reserved",,,,,,,,,,,,"Towards patient empowerment in Saudi healthcare: the place of a positive patient rights culture",,,"Electronic Thesis or Dissertation",,"Health Sciences",,"University of Canterbury",,"Doctoral",,,"Doctor of Philosophy",,"2589009",,,"College of Education, Health and Human Development, University of Canterbury",,"Phd.faisal@hotmail.com",,,,,,,,,"Professor Ray Kirk"
"6645","10092/806",,,"Rahaman, Muhammed Mahbubur",,,,,,,,"2011",,,"The purpose of this phenomenological study is to understand and describe the inclusive education practices for students with disabilities in secondary schools in Bangladesh. In Bangladesh, ensuring all children with disabilities attend schools especially mainstream classrooms is a priority, rather than ensuring the quality of instruction. An underlying belief in Bangladesh is that if quantity can be achieved, then quality will increase. This is why I decided to examine teachers‘ perspectives (central phenomenon) of inclusive education. There is no research that describes or supports Bangladesh teachers‘ perspectives.
Many theorists have taken different angles on the conceptualisation surrounding disability and education. This project is underpinned by the social constructivist view of disability that has developed from the works of Lev Vygotsky (1896 –1934). The underlying premise is that teachers are all experts in different ways, and that their different experiences and understandings are of value. On the basis of socio-cultural theory, a conceptual framework has been developed to understand inclusive practices which are viewed from two levels: the Macro and Micro levels. For delimitation in terms of time and scope, my research is located within the two components of micro level practice especially focusing on the quality of instruction and teachers‘ values, attitudes and beliefs within my conceptual framework. This study intends to answer the main research question: How do teachers in secondary schools in Bangladesh understand inclusion? In this connection, understanding is seen as an
inseparable and interconnected outcome of practices, attitudes and beliefs, and knowledge of teachers. The research used a phenomenological research design consisting of participant interviews and observations. An additional questionnaire was used to measure teacher attitudes and understanding of teaching strategies. A total of 12 interviews (two for each participant classroom teacher) and 12 observations (two of each participant) were conducted.
This thesis consists of four chapters. Chapter 1 is an introductory chapter based on an extensive review of the literature. Chapter 2 describes the study methodologies, chapter 3 presents the analysis and significant findings and chapter 4 contains the discussion, draws recommendations and explores the implications of the findings.
The study explores valuable information to identify the existing inclusive practice at the secondary level in Bangladesh. Respondents stated the need for and potential benefits of inclusive education practice, because inclusive education was supporting collaboration among students with and without disabilities and fostering academic achievements. Teachers encountered enormous challenges in practicing inclusive education due to their inadequate knowledge and limited professional development scopes. The barriers for teachers within inclusive education practice are likely the result of their beliefs and experiences in relation to students with disabilities and professional support. Positive attitudes toward appropriate teaching and learning for students with disabilities could improve the situation. Unfamiliarity with local
disability legalisation of teachers is likely to limit the opportunity for students with disabilities to gain access to what is rightfully theirs. Teachers identified that success within their practice is largely depending on their strategies for managing large class sizes and coping with excessive class load. Modification of existing assessment and evaluation system was also revealed as an option to better embrace inclusive education.
Participants found that student-centric evidence-based teaching and learning strategies are more effective than their traditional lecture-based teaching and learning practices in supporting inclusive education. Teachers‘ discomfort in dealing with students with hidden disabilities in terms of learning and behavioural difficulties portrayed negative aspects of inclusive education practice in Bangladesh. In such a situation, empowering teachers in the classroom may be helpful in order to construct inclusive pedagogy.
Finally, the findings of the research will support policy makers and other researchers learn about the constraints, opportunities and choices for possible future changes in inclusive education policy and practice in developing countries such as Bangladesh. Moreover, the research will contribute to wider national and international debates around inclusive education.",,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/6302",,,,"en",,,,,"University of Canterbury.

study conducted semi-structured interviews with six English teachers and focus group
interviews with two groups of students in two different secondary schools and these interview

teachers and the students.
These findings reveal that the present English assessment system in the secondary level in
Bangladesh does not reflect a balanced development of all the language skills of the learners
and there are inconsistencies between the stated objectives of teaching English and the actual
teaching methods in the language teaching in the secondary schools in Bangladesh. Though
summative assessment is still dominating, the practice of formative assessment is slowly
developing.
The study indicates that there has been a gradual shift in the assessment process and the
teachers were trying to use individual assessment strategies to motivate the students’
learning. Both the teachers and the students in the study emphasised that current assessment
is mainly based on reading and writing. However, for overall development of language skills,
the secondary English language curriculum may need to be redesigned so that all the four
skills are able to be included in the assessment system. Better opportunities for training to

The results of this study will inform the design of a more comprehensive research project assessing the differences between the psychopathology of clinic-referred children in out-of-home care and children from the general population. The overall goal is for researchers and clinicians to be able to better understand the underlying determinisms of the psychopathology of children in out-of-home care.
Three samples were used for the between-group comparisons. The Children in Care Study (CICS) sample consists of 213 clinic-referred children in out-of-home care between the ages of four and eleven years. Firstly, this group was compared to 800 clinic-referred children, between six and eleven years, from the general population. For this analysis, the CICS sample was adjusted to match this group’s age range. Secondly, the entire CICS sample was compared to 1201 clinic-referred children, between the ages of four and eleven, from the general population. Mental health presentations were measured using the Child Behaviour Checklist (CBCL). A within-subject comparison was conducted comparing the CICS sample’s CBCL DSM-oriented scores to the children’s caregiver-reported diagnosis.
Results indicated that clinic-referred children in care presented with significantly fewer internalising symptoms than clinic-referred children from the general population. Clinic-referred children in care displayed greater correlations among their CBCL subscale scores than other clinic-referred children, which may suggest greater symptom complexity. Additionally, there appeared to be poor concordance between caregiver-reported psychiatric diagnoses and CBCL DSM-oriented scores for clinic-referred children in out-of-home care.
Overall, the mental health presentations measured by the CBCL indicated that the differences between the two populations were relatively small in terms of their severity. However, clinic-referred children in care presented with less severe internalising problems
than other clinic-referred children. Further research is needed to explore the issues underlying diagnostic dis-concordance and the complexity of the mental health presentations of children in state ordered care.",,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/6496",,,,"en",,,,,"University of Canterbury.

"6801","10092/806",,,"McLay, Laura-Lee Kathleen",,,,,,,,"2011",,,"Language development involves the learning of multiple sets of equivalence relations. Research has shown that if certain conditional relations are directly taught for one member of a class of stimuli, then additional conditional relations often emerge for other members of that class, without direct training. There are currently very few studies which have demonstrated this research finding in individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD).  The research design used for the present experiment was a single-subject AB cross-over design replicated across five plus five children with ASD and five plus five typically developing children. The children with ASD and the typically developing children were matched on their level of vocabulary development.  Participants were randomly assigned to either a teaching order Treatment A+B or a teaching order Treatment B+A. The first experimental treatment (Treatment A+B) involved teaching responses to S1 and S2 in the order Condition A followed by Condition B.  The second experimental treatment (Treatment B+A) involved teaching responses to S1 and S2 in the order Condition B followed by Condition A. Condition A involved the teaching of AB and AC (hear-select) relations, and Condition B involved the teaching of BA and CA (see-say) relations. The participants in this study were taught stimulus-response relations that involved six names and numerical representations of quantities in the range 1 to 18. Tests for the emergence of symmetry and transitivity were then conducted. The relationships between the emergence of the untaught equivalence relations and teaching condition, the entering characteristics of the children, and trials to criterion were examined. The results of this study showed that five out of ten participants with ASD demonstrated the emergence of all of the untaught equivalence relations regardless of the treatment condition. The remaining five participants with ASD showed substantial variability. Of the children in the Typically Developing Group nine of the ten demonstrated emergence of all of the untaught equivalence relations.  The variables that were most strongly correlated with the emergence of untaught equivalence relations were speed of acquisition of taught relations, functional academics scores, and the chronological age of the participants. The effect of communication ability, pre-academic numeracy skill level, and the experimental treatment (the teaching order conditions) were not strongly related to the emergence of untaught equivalence relations. These findings suggest that outcomes on tests for emergence may have been a function of children’s rate of development and prior learning history. The findings of the current study are best explained by Relational Frame Theory. The implications of these findings for teaching children with ASD and other developmental disabilities, and also teaching in general are discussed.",,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/6351",,,,"en",,,,,"University of Canterbury.

Shaila",,,,,,,,"2011",,,"This qualitative study focused on four secondary school physics teachers in Bangladesh using semi-structured interviews and observations to explore their understanding about the relationship between practical work and developing students’ conceptual knowledge of physics. Recent studies indicate that practical work helps secondary science students easily and effectively learn the concepts and theories of physics. However, the secondary school physics teachers in Bangladesh in this study did not provide students with practical work during classroom teaching. Rather, they provided practical work in separate practical classes. Although the teachers believed that practical work made their teaching and also students’ learning easier and effective, they did not offer frequent practical demonstrations in teaching the contents of physics. 
The major findings of the study include that teachers used mostly transmissive pedagogy to assist students to understand physics concepts and theories. Even though there are clear and specific instructions for the teachers to do demonstrations in the secondary physics curriculum, there were constraints on teachers and on students trying to conduct practical work. Constraints included: a lack of sufficient equipment. Teachers and students in non-government schools faced comparatively more difficulties than those in government schools. Low teacher/student ratios and no positions for laboratory assistants were reasons given for teachers’ intense workloads.
This study implies a need to provide government and non-government schools with necessary equipment for doing practical work; to appoint sufficient teachers with higher studies and training that includes practical work in physics; to create positions for laboratory assistants; to set up classrooms with a smaller number of students; and to develop awareness of the value of practical work among school administration and among physics teachers.",,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/6291",,,,"en",,,,,"University of Canterbury.

"7112","10092/806",,,"Fletcher, Josephine Florence",,,,,,,,"2011",,,"This thesis addresses better understandings of the wider systemic factors that support 11- to 13-year-old students in reading. A socio-constructivist paradigm was used to view multiple constructions of realities. Using a socially constructed ontology a mainly qualitative approach was instigated. From five case study New Zealand schools the principals, literacy leaders, teachers, parents and students were interviewed. Additionally, a structured observation schedule was used to observe the teachers during a guided reading lesson. By viewing the phenomenon through a range of participants’ lenses I aimed to portray the richness of the case studies and provide thick descriptions of the phenomenon. 
The thesis uncovered that the research literature contains few studies of the teaching of reading to children aged 11 to 13. This appears to be because much of the research has been carried out in the UK and USA where children move out of primary (elementary) education at age 11 or younger. This suggests a need for an international comparative study to determine if this factor is significant in the reading achievement of 11- to 13-year old-children.  My research shows the reading development of these young adolescents in New Zealand occurs within a variety of contexts. Teachers alone cannot bear the burden of sole responsibility for the reading achievement of young adolescent students. There was a complex array of wider factors that supported teachers in developing regular, sustained and effective reading programmes. All of the schools had been involved in sustained professional development in literacy which was led by an external provider. The principals had taken an active part in the professional development alongside their staff. Additionally, the principals at each school had appointed a literacy leader to support staff in the teaching of reading. The principals had developed relational trust with their staff and together were working towards a shared vision. Apparent across all interviews with parents, students, teachers and literacy leaders was a quiet confidence that each of the case study schools were being led in a successful manner. What some of the parents did bring to attention was the range of experiences they had with different schools the children in their families had attended. A surprise finding in the analyses of the structured observation of guided reading was that even though the eight teachers had been nominated as effective teachers of reading, many of these teachers allowed little opportunity for student-led dialogue.
This case study research investigation found numerous areas of effective practice both within the classroom and by the wider school staff, but it also identified some common aspects in these particular five schools where teacher, wider school-community practices and national educational policy could be enhanced. Additionally, the quantitative analyses of data from the teachers’ and students’ interactions during guided reading illuminated the sometimes contradictory nature of interview data and observation data. This finding highlighted the importance of including quantitative analysis of classroom observation data when investigating teachers’ practices, as the difference between ‘rhetoric’ and ‘classroom reality’ can differ. The evidence from these case studies strongly suggests that learning to read is not a skill that is learnt in isolation. Reading is not only a complex skill to achieve, but it is also contextual. Therefore, understanding the context and the varying players, who all have specific roles in supporting reading, are the cornerstones of knowing how we as a society can improve reading outcomes for all students.",,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/6636",,,,"en",,,,,"University of Canterbury.

"6821","10092/806",,,"Jamieson, Isabel Margaret",,,,,,,,"2012",,,"Background
This descriptive exploratory study was undertaken to ascertain the views of Generation Y New Zealand Registered Nurses (Gen Y nurses) towards nursing, work and career. Little empirical data exists about why young New Zealanders choose to become nurses in the 21st century. Further, little is known about their future career plans or their intentions to remain in the nursing workforce. Currently there is a global nursing workforce shortage with indications that shortages will continue into the future. The nursing shortage is occurring at a time when many populations are ageing and placing unprecedented demands on both health care providers and health care systems. Not only are populations ageing, the burden of chronic disease is escalating. However, there is strong evidence highlighting positive patient outcomes when nursing care is provided by registered nurses. Therefore the long term retention of young nurses is of critical importance for both the health care consumer and the profession. 
Method
	A nationwide on-line survey was undertaken with 358 Gen Y Nurses from late 2009 to early 2010.
Key findings
	Young New Zealanders are driven by traditional values of altruism, the desire to care for others, the ability to work closely with people, as well as being able to make a strong contribution to society when deciding to become a nurse. Further, they are seeking interesting, challenging and exciting work. Job security, the ongoing demand for nurses, the ability to leave and return, as well as the ability to combine work and family, are also important factors that help them to choose to become nurses. 
The Gen Y nurses were overwhelmingly satisfied with their decision to become nurses but they are very clear that nursing does not define them. They appear set to remain in the profession for at least five years with many stating that they wish to increase their clinical skills as well as undertake formal postgraduate study. However, while the Gen Y nurses demonstrated a high level of affective commitment towards nursing, they do not show a high level of continuance or normative commitment. It is questionable if they have long term career plans to remain in nursing.

Further, the Gen Y nurses find nursing work to be more stressful and challenging than they anticipated. They expressed concern about nursing salaries, workplace bullying and the impact of shift work on their private lives. They are also concerned about the apparent lack of recognition demonstrated by managers and management of the contribution that nurses make to patient care. A further concern for Gen Y nurses is the lack of understanding by the public about the role of registered nurses.
Conclusion
	Most young New Zealanders who decide to become nurses do not regret their decision to do so. They have chosen to become nurses because of their desire to care for others in a team focused environment with a promise of job security. Many Gen Y nurses are planning on advancing their careers by increasing their clinical skills and academic knowledge. While some are planning to seek promotion, the majority want to remain in a clinical role, at the bedside. While the Gen Y nurses view themselves as career motivated they do not demonstrate a high level of career commitment to nursing. It is therefore imperative that the nursing profession, as well as nursing employers and policy makers, collaborate to design a workplace and work conditions that motivate Gen Y nurses to want to remain in the profession for the long term.",,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/6499",,,,"en",,,,,"University of Canterbury.

"7171","10092/806",,,"Carson, Karyn Louise",,,,,,,,"2012",,,"International studies of reading achievement demonstrate that significant inequalities in reading outcomes continue to exist among some of the world’s wealthiest countries, despite strong investment in initiatives directed towards raising literacy achievement for all children (United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation—UNESCO, 2009; United Nations Children’s Fund—UNICEF, 2010).  One approach towards the elevation of reading achievement is to investigate how key predictors of reading success are incorporated into everyday classroom literacy practices.  Phonological awareness (PA) is widely recognised as a powerful predictor and underlying precursor to early reading success for both typically developing and at-risk readers (Al Otaiba, Kosanovich, & Torgesen, 2012; Blachman, Ball, Black, & Tangel, 2000; Goswami, 2001; Pressley, 2006).  A majority of research demonstrating the benefits of PA to literacy growth has been conducted under controlled research settings outside of the classroom environment (Ehri, Nunes, Willows, Schuster, Yaghoub-Zadeh, & Shanahan, 2001; Gillon, 2000a, 2005; Gillon & McNeill, 2009), and thus less is known about whether such benefits hold true when integrated into the heterogeneous classroom setting.  For this reason, four experiments reported in this thesis investigated whether PA can be efficiently and effectively integrated into the classroom literacy programme with the overarching aim of raising reading achievement and equalising reading outcomes for the majority of children in the first year of formal education.
	In the first experiment (reported in Chapter 3), time-efficiency and congruency of scores between a computer-based PA screening and monitoring tool (described in Chapter 2) and a paper-based equivalent were examined.  Thirty-three children aged between four years 10 months and five years zero months participated in the study, 12 of whom presented with moderate-severe speech delay (MSD).  Participants were randomly allocated to either Group A or Group B experimental assessment conditions.  A crossover research design was employed where Group A received the paper-based version of the PA assessment followed two weeks later by the equivalent computer-based assessment (CBA).  Group B received the same assessments but in the reverse order of delivery.  That is, the computer-based PA assessment first followed two weeks later by the paper-based counterpart.  Results demonstrated that: 1) the CBA generated comparable scores to the paper-based equivalent for both children with typical development and children with MSD, and 2) CBA took 31 per cent less time than paper-based administration.  These results demonstrate that CBA can provide educators with a time-efficient approach to the screening and monitoring of PA development in the classroom while maintaining equivalency of scores with paper-based testing.  Having established the time-efficiency of CBA, the next step was to investigate the use of the computer-based PA screening and monitoring tool as part of the beginning classroom reading programme.
	In the second experiment (reported in Chapter 4), the influence of a short and intensive period of teacher-implemented classroom PA instruction on reading outcomes in the first year of education was investigated.  One-hundred and twenty-nine children aged five-years participated in the study.  Using a quasi-experimental design, thirty-four children in two classrooms received 10 weeks of PA instruction from their teachers, as an adjunct to the ‘usual’ reading programme.  Ninety-five children from 10 classrooms continued with the ‘usual’ reading programme, which included phonics instruction but did not target PA.  Results demonstrated that children exposed to classroom PA instruction performed significantly higher on reading and spelling measures compared to children who received the ‘usual’ reading programme only.  Of importance, the number of children experiencing word decoding difficulties after one year of schooling reduced from 26 per cent among children who followed the ‘usual’ reading programme to 6 per cent among children who received classroom PA instruction.  These results provide evidence that a short and intensive period of classroom-wide PA instruction in the first year of schooling can have a positive influence on raising reading achievement.
	In the third experiment (reported in Chapter 5), the effect of classroom PA instruction on raising reading achievement and reducing inequality in literacy outcomes for children with spoken language impairment (SLI) was examined.  The data from 129 five-year-old children who participated in the second experiment were extracted and analysed.  End-of-year reading outcomes between children with SLI who received classroom PA instruction (n = 7) was compared to: 1) children with typical language development (TD) who received classroom PA instruction (n = 27), 2) children with SLI who followed the ‘usual’ reading programme (n = 21), and 3) children with TD who followed the ‘usual’ reading programme (n = 74).  Children with SLI who received classroom PA instruction showed significant improvements in PA, reading and spelling acquisition immediately and up to six months following PA instruction.  However, this cohort, in comparison to children with TD, appeared less able to transfer their enhanced PA knowledge to reading and writing tasks.  Of importance, children with SLI who received PA instruction performed significantly higher than children with SLI who followed the ‘usual’ reading curriculum; and on par with children with TD who followed the ‘usual’ reading programme.  Children with TD who received classroom PA instruction significantly outperformed all other cohorts in this experiment on end-of year reading measures.  These results indicate that both children with TD and children with risk for reading difficulties can benefit from classroom-wide teacher-directed PA instruction.  These findings have positive implications for elevating reading achievement and reducing inequality between good and poor readers.
	In the fourth experiment (reported in Chapter 6), the validity and reliability of the computer-based PA screening and monitoring tool was investigated and established.  Using a longitudinal research design, the responses of 95 children to test items in the CBA at the start, middle and end of the first year at school were collated and analysed to provide evidence of content, construct and criterion validity, in addition to test-retest and internal consistency reliability.  A number of statistical analyses were employed including Rasch Model analysis, exploratory factor analysis and multiple regression analysis.  Results demonstrated that the majority of test items were appropriate for five-year-old children in the first year of school and sampled a spectrum of ability levels that would be present in a typical classroom environment.  Rhyme oddity, initial phoneme identity and letter-knowledge tasks were most appropriate at school-entry while tasks of final phoneme identity, phoneme blending and phoneme segmentation became more suitable by the middle and end stages of the first year at school.  Importantly, performance on the CBA predicted end-of-year reading status with 94 per cent accuracy, and in conjunction with language abilities accounted for 68.9 per cent of the variance in end-of-year reading performance.  These findings indicate that the computer-based PA screening and monitoring tool developed and applied in this thesis has sufficient validity and reliability to be used confidently as a time-efficient assessment tool in the classroom.
	The results from the experiments reported in this thesis provide evidence that PA can be efficiently and effectively integrated into the beginning classroom reading programme from two complementary perspectives: 1) through use of computer-based screening and monitoring of PA skills, and 2) through implementation of a short and intensive period of teacher-directed classroom-wide PA instruction.  The results reported in this thesis demonstrate that the evidenced-based integration of key predictors of literacy success, such as PA, into existing classroom programmes can support national and international initiatives that seek to raise reading achievement and reduce inequalities in literacy outcomes for all children.",,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/6683",,,,"en",,,,,"University of Canterbury.

identify the role of mother language in education. The role described from the perspectives of the
Head Teacher/ Principal, Bangla language Teacher, Curriculum planner, Community leaders
(from Chakma, Marma and Tripura community), and Tribal Students from the three tribal
groups. Drawing on an understanding of curriculum as a tool for the social control of knowledge,
I show how the secondary language curriculum promotes social inequality by the intellectual
domination of Bangla and English over less prestigious tribal languages by not including
indigenous languages, culture and values. This is particularly important for my position as a
teacher educator in Bangladesh, and working along with school teachers. I used qualitative
methods to interview tribal leaders, students and their teachers and analyse curriculum
documents. My findings show that because the medium of instruction in schools is Bangla, it is
difficult for tribal students to speak or understand Bangla language, as it is not the language used
in their homes and communities. Tribal students are often unclear about school lessons, and the
knowledge they acquire in schools cannot be related to their family and social life. Indigenous
students do not involve themselves in classroom activities and quality education is not achieved
for their life success. Findings reveal that the role of mother language is important in identity and
learning for tribal students, and needs to be encouraged and valued both in policy and practice

It addresses the issues within Aotearoa New Zealand Primary school settings. The study used a mixed methodology approach. Quantitative data was collected in the form of questionnaires to collect information from a range of participants and to identify potential participants for individual interviews. More in-depth qualitative data were collected through semi-structured interviews conducted with four teachers.

The findings suggest that many teachers are uncertain about the social and emotional characteristics and needs of gifted and talented children. Teachers expressed positive attitudes towards gifted and talented children while acknowledging their lack of personal knowledge about gifted and talented education. The findings also identified teachers‘ frustrations at barriers affecting their ability to support gifted and talented children‘s social and emotional needs in their classroom programmes, including, limited personal knowledge and skills, lack of professional development, lack of time to spend with gifted and talented children, and school directed priorities for meeting the needs of other children.

The findings of this study have implications for teachers wanting to support gifted and talented children, educators interested in the social and emotional needs of gifted and talented children, and those responsible for gifted and talented education (GATE) programmes and GATE professional development. It would seem that it is highly desirable for all teachers to have professional development in gifted and talented education, in order to better understand social and emotional aspects, and thereby provide a more supportive environment where gifted and talented children can learn and grow.",,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/5014",,,,"en",,,,,"University of Canterbury.

One intervention used for children with EBD is residential treatment, which involves “providing a full range of therapeutic, education, recreational and support services given by a professional, interdisciplinary team” (Johansson 2007, pg. 16).  To date there is little literature on the effectiveness of residential treatment for children with EBD.   This present study aims to further the research by measuring the progress made towards a child’s personal goals while at residential school and if this progress is still evident six months after returning home and entering mainstream schooling.  Child and parent feedback on the time spent at residential treatment are examined to see how they viewed the treatment.  The participants consisted of 83 children aged seven to thirteen years who had attended the residential school between 2004 and 2009, their parents/caregivers, mainstream teachers and residential treatment staff.  Follow up questionnaires given to the parents/caregivers when the child was leaving residential treatment and the child’s leavers report were analysed using a mixed methods approach.  The results of this study indicated that the children’s personal goal attainment did not change at a statistically significant level six months after returning home and entering mainstream schooling  Findings were consistent across the three age groups analysed (under 8 years 11 months, 9 years -10 years 11 months and over 11 years) as well as across the goal codes.

In medical education and training, VR simulators use computer-generated objects on computer interface and allow the trainee or student to manipulate objects to receive feedback on the performance. The purpose of this thesis is to synthesize evidence on the effectiveness of different virtual reality based immersive training tools for health professionals.
A systematic review of the literature was conducted to assess the effectiveness of VR tools in the training of health professionals. A focused search of literature resulted in an initial retrieval of 1379 relevant titles and abstracts of peer reviewed publications. All retrieved articles were initially evaluated based on titles and abstracts to identify studies to be retained for further analysis based on full text appraisal, using the Participant-Intervention-Comparator-Outcome (PICO) criteria.  After review of titles and abstract, a total of 24 publications were selected for final review. Of the 24 studies identified as eligible, one was a meta-analysis, another was a systematic review, two were other types of reviews, ten were reports of Randomised Control Trials and eleven were observational or quasi-experimental studies. 
Critical appraisal of these studies resulted in identification of 12 different types of applications and nine overlapping ‘themes’ related to VR simulations and clinical skill training. In general, findings from this review indicate that, VR simulators can be considered a useful tool for improvement of clinical skills performance especially for novices with limited experience.  
In combination with existing opportunities to work with real patients, VR based training can increase the range of experience to learn about and deal with medical problems as learners and practitioners. The current evidence on the effectiveness of using VR training applications for improvement of clinical skills of health professionals is limited but sufficiently encouraging to justify additional clinical trials in this area. 
There remain several limitations in the research on the effectiveness of using VR training environments for health professionals. Further research work is required on role of virtual reality simulators in the transfer of skills, optimal VR applications and their technology for each discipline in medicine, economical success and other issues of VR usage, if medical skills laboratories are to remain an integral component of medical education.",,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/6721",,,,"en",,,,,"University of Canterbury.

peoples than other ethnic group.
Researchers in Cardiology documented that CVD begins early in a person’s life
and that a person's risk of cardiovascular disease is determined by risk factors that
contribute to a form of CVD over time.
This thesis, “The Cardiovascular Risk Factors in Adolescents of Christchurch: A
Cross-Sectional Survey (CRFAC)”, is the first of its kind in the South Island, and was
designed to estimate the prevalence of risk factors for cardiovascular disease for
adolescent high school students in New Zealand. The aims of the study were to
determine cardiovascular risk factor levels between, Pacific, Asian, Maori, and European
students, with the Pacific communities including (Samoan, Cook Islands, Tongan, and
Niuean). The CRFAC was a school-based cross-sectional survey of 1051 adolescent
students, across nine Christchurch High Schools.
The study specifically aimed to determine ethnic-specific differences in lifestyle
and intermediate variables that have been established as cardiovascular risks. Variables
included: smoking, alcohol consumption, leisure-time physical activity (LTPA),
television exposure, and sun exposure, and body mass index (BMI). Demographic
variables analyzed included: form (level of education), gender, ethnic group, and socioeconomic
status.
In regards to smoking and alcohol consumption, Maori had the highest rates
overall 77% and 88%, respectfully. As for LTPA, the type of activity that was
participated in varied between sex and ethnicity. For instance, netball was played
predominately more for females than males, and rugby was played more so by
European/Pakehas than compared to Asians. Maori and Pacific also had a higher
proportion 43.4% and 33.7%, respectively, who watched TV four or more hours per week
day on average compared to the other ethnicities. Sun exposure varied strongly with
ethnicity, with Asian students having a smaller proportion 20.1% in the high daily sun
exposure category compared with Maori 40.8 % daily (p< 0.001).
The CRFAC study results showed that demographic variables were associated
with the intermediate variables: lifestyle and BMI. The findings showed that there were
substantive ethnic variations between the four main ethnic groups (Pacific, Maori, Asian
and European) in risk factors for cardiovascular disease.
The CRFAC study was able to identify contributing factors, for which gave the
investigator clarity to possible reasons for ethnic differences in BMI. The CRFAC study
results showed that Pacific participants had the highest BMI levels of all the ethnic
groups, followed by Maori.",,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/6722",,,,"en",,,,,"University of Canterbury.

definition of wisdom. His second method was to help others discover this wisdom

Earlier Dialogs using the elenchus to fulfil this mission. This form of argument has
been described by Socratic scholars, but contradictions between it and statements
made by Socrates of what he did indicate it may not be the method he used.
Socrates may not have used the elenchus, but he did do something and what it was
can be identified from his statements; providing these are accepted as reliable.
The method proposed indicates that Socrates rationally examined life by asking
people why they take certain actions. Their answers were either in terms of the
expected results, or general statements of what a person should do. Socrates
appears to have examined the first type of answer directly by a cross-examination
of the person's opinions of what the consequences will be. He appears to have
examined the second type of answer by examining examples based on the general
statement. The first type of examination will indicate whether it is wise to take a
particular action or not. The second type of examination will only indicate whether
the aim of the action is worthwhile.
The evidence suggests that Socrates had a pragmatic method of examining life
which indicates which actions are most likely to bring the best results and
therefore the best life. The wise person will use the method to examine their life,

"7349","10092/806",,,"Warren, Alison Margaret",,,,,,,,"2012",,,"Early childhood teachers spend their professional lives in social interactions with children, families and colleagues. Social interactions shape how people understand themselves and each other through discourses. Teachers in Aotearoa New Zealand negotiate their subjectivities, or self-understandings, within initial teacher education (ITE), professional expectations, education and society. They are shaped by historical and contemporary discourses of early childhood teaching professionalism as they gain status as qualified and registered teachers. Early childhood teachers’ understandings of their personal professional identities influence self-understandings of everyone they encounter professionally, especially young children.   
This poststructural qualitative collective case study investigates five newly-qualified early childhood teachers’ negotiations of their personal professional identities. My research study is based in postmodern understandings of identities as multiple, complex and dynamic, and subjectivities as self-understandings formed within discourses. In contrast, institutionally-directed reflective writing in early childhood ITE can reflect modernist perspectives that assume essentialist, knowable identities. Tensions exist between my postmodern theoretical framework and my data collection strategy of facilitated self-study, an approach that is usually based on the modernist assumption that there is a self to investigate and know. My participants explored their subjectivities through focus group discussions, individual interviews, and reflective writing, including institutionally-directed reflective writing. 
Three dominant discourses of early childhood education emerged from data analysis that drew on Foucault’s theoretical ideas: the authority discourse, the relational professionalism discourse and the identity work discourse. Positioned in these discourses, all participants regarded themselves as qualified and knowledgeable, skilled at professional relationships and as reflective practitioners. They actively negotiated tensions between professional expectations and understandings of their multiple, complex and changing identities. I concluded that these participants negotiated understandings of their personal professional identities within three dominant discourses through discursive practices of discipline and governmentality, seeking pleasurable subject positions, and agentic negotiation of tensions and contradictions between available subjectivities.",,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/7016",,,,"en",,,,,"University of Canterbury.

"10437","10092/806",,,"Dickson, Tabitha Gwendoline",,,,,,,,"2013",,,"Rock climbing is thought to rely upon the interaction of various performance components, and has previously been described as a complex multi-faceted sport. It has been suggested that psychological aspects of performance, such as task perception and the interaction of resulting pre-climb anxieties, contribute greatly to the physiological responses and the overall performance during ascent. However, research which seeks to investigate both psychological and physiological responses during specific bouts of rock climbing are few in number. This thesis attempts to contribute to the novel yet limited body of field based psychophysological research relating to rock climbing. To this end, the studies contained within this thesis investigated psychological and physiological responses as a result of difficult on-sight rock climbing. Elaborating upon previous research, additonal factors which are thought to influence these responses were explored. More specifically, differences in responses between ability groups, style of ascent, and route type were investigated. 
	In study one, differences in psychological and physiological responses with respect to ability level and ascent style were investigated, during a single on-sight ascent. Seventy-two climbers were split into ability groups defined as lower-grade, intermediate, advanced and elite based on self-reported on-sight grades (Ewbank) of ≤17, 18-20, 21-24 and ≥ 25 respectively. Each climber attempted an on-sight ascent of a designated test route set on an indoor artificial climbing wall. A separate test route was set for each ability group which targeted their self-reported ability with respect to best on-sight. Participants were randomly assigned to either a lead or top-rope ascent and climbers were not informed of their style of ascent until 15 min prior to climbing. Responses to the climbing task were measured pre, during, and post-climb using a number of psychological and physiological markers. 
	In total fifty-two participants successfully completed their on-sight ascents, and data for successful ascents were analysed and compared. Pre-climb variables were considered together in order to investigate pre-climb state, more specifically levels of anxiety, prior to ascent. Results indicated that there were no significant differences for grouped pre-climb variables with respect to ascent style. These results suggest that irrespective of ascent style, successful climbers exhibited similar psychophysiological responses prior to attempting an on-sight ascent. Furthermore, this trend was replicated across all ability groups. These findings were thought to be indicative of the high demand and level of uncerainty imposed by the on-sight condition of ascent, lending support to previous suggestion that an on-sight ascent induces the highest anxiety response. During the climb, HR and   were measured and averaged across the entirety of the ascent. When expressed as a percentage of   and   the average HR and   responses during ascent were found to be comparable across ability groups. As such, all ability groups appeared to utilise similar fractions of maximal capacity, with elite climbers successfully ascending a route up to eight difficulty grades harder than those of lower ability, whilst still performing at the same workload intensity. It would appear that oxygen uptake during rock climbing may not be directly related to difficulty or personal ability. A technical advantage, personal climbing style, and possible physiological adaptations may be contributors to more strategic and efficient ascents resulting in the capacity to climb at higher grades of difficulty.
	The second study presented within this thesis was comprised of two phases of investigation; (1) to investigate whether psychological and physiological responses to competition-style climbing differed with respect to ability level, and (2) to investigate potential psychological and physiological differences based on route type and outcome (success and failure). In phase 1 of study two, intermediate, advanced and elite climbers attempted an lead on-sight ascent of a competition-style route which increased in difficulty as the climber progressed. The route was set with the intention of being just beyond the upper limits of the elite climbers self-reported best on-sight ability (~26 Ewbank). This was done in order to ensure that a fall from the route was highly likely, even for the elite climbers. All climbers failed to successfuly ascend the test route and as such all climbed to the point of failure resulting in a fall. The results obtained both prior to, and during ascent suggest that the intermediate and advanced climbers in the current study may have been limited by technical ability as opposed to physical exhaustion, or increased levels of anxiety. Elite climbers were to be able to maintain a more sustained physical effort during the more difficult phases of the climb. This appeared to be reflected in post-climb blood lactate concentration and ratings of task demand with respect to both physical demand and effort. As such it may be that elite climbers are more accustomed to maximal effort and demonstrate an increased tolerance to the higher exercise intensity required during more difficult ascents.
	In the second phase of study two the psychological and physiological responses of climbers in a competitive setting obtained in phase 1, were compared with those exhibited by participants during both successful and unsuccessful lead on-sight ascents in study one. The aim of study two phase 2 was to determine whether the responses of successful climbers differed from those who succeeded by reaching the top of a route, and performances in a competitive context where success is denoted by the distance achieved by a climbers on their ascent. The main findings in this instance were that although there were no significant differences observed between categories of ascent (successful, unsuccessful and competition) for grouped pre-climb variables, trends in CSAI-2R responses indicated high cognitive anxiety coupled with lower self-confidence prior to unsuccessful ascents. As such it may be that self-confidence acts as a buffer in moderating success in rock climbing, demonstrating the role of positive emotions and their impact upon performance as opposed to the detrimental effect of the negative. A second finding of this study was that there appeared to be a differing HR-  relationship based on ascent category. Modest increases in   were shown for all ascents, irrespective of ability level. A plateau in   response was accompanied by a similar plateau in HR response during successful ascents, yet HR was shown to increase in a linear fashion until point of failure during unsuccessful ascents. It is possible that these findings highlight the presence of a climbing specific limitation.",,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/9444",,,,"en",,,,,"University of Canterbury.

"7187","10092/806",,,"Mat Daud, n/a",,,,,,,,"2011",,,"Critical thinking skills have been identified as learning outcomes expected of students for most courses of tertiary education in many countries including Malaysia. One of the courses where critical thinking is required is academic writing. Producing academic writing which is well argued, insightful, thought-provoking, characterised by evidence and wide reading is a challenge for undergraduate students. Not only do the students need to have a good command of the language, they also need to be critical as they examine viewpoints, facts and arguments and synthesise them. This thesis explores several approaches to developing critical thinking skills in an academic writing course for undergraduate students.   

The use of a rubric or a checklist and discussion with peers were identified in the study to support the development of critical thinking. Their potency was explored in a quasi- experimental study involving undergraduate students taking English for Academic Writing course. The three treatments groups were: peer review where students used a checklist and discussed their ideas; peer evaluation where students used the rubric and discussed their ideas and evaluations; self-evaluation where students used the rubric but did not discuss their ideas. The level of critical thinking for each groups and a control group who received no treatment, was measured before and after learning interventions using two instruments: the Cornell Critical Thinking Test Level X (CCTT-X) and the English for Academic Writing term paper. In addition, students’ and instructors’ perspectives on the learning activities were elicited by means of questionnaires and interviews. Classroom observations were also carried out.

The rubric which was used in the peer evaluation and self-evaluation activities is called the Critical Thinking for Academic Writing Analytical Rubric (CAWAR). It contains 12 criteria with descriptions of the two ends of performance domains i.e. the best and the weakest points and a commentary space. The checklist used in the peer review activity, on the other hand, replicates the CAWAR except that it does not have the grading element.

The study found that all treatments showed some potential for fostering the development of critical thinking skills. Theoretically, it is argued that peer evaluation has the greatest potential of the three treatments provided that both teachers and students understand the value of collaborative learning and the importance of giving sufficient time for discussion. The introduction of either the rubric or checklist or promoting peer discussion has promoted critical thinking in an academic writing course.",,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/6866",,,,"en",,,,,"University of Canterbury.

"7168","10092/806",,,"Torepe, Toni Kiriana",,,,,,,,"2011",,,"This thesis draws on data from a research study that investigated the lived experiences of six
Māori teachers who had recently graduated from the Hōaka Pounamu (Graduate Diploma in
Immersion and Bilingual Teaching). The primary objective of this research was to gain a
deeper understanding of the lived experiences and various challenges confronting this group
of Māori teachers working in English medium primary and secondary schools. These schools
were all located in the Waitaha (Canterbury) region of New Zealand’s South Island. Each of
these schools was, to varying degrees, dominated by what appeared to be a Eurocentric
institutional culture of schooling. This research, accordingly, focused closely upon the
challenges that these teachers faced as they sought to incorporate mātauranga Māori (Māori
knowledge that validates a Māori world view) into their teaching praxis in that culture of
schooling.
This study is distinguished by qualitative research methodology underpinned by a kaupapa
Māori narrative research philosophy. The study’s findings support and strengthen those of
previous studies. However, while these teachers’ accounts echoed the sentiments of teachers
in previous research studies (Bloor, 1993; Ministry of Education, 1999; Mitchell & Mitchell,
1993) this research ensures that the narratives of the participants are at the fore of the thesis
rather than lost in a sea of quantitative data. As a result, it offers fresh insights into the
challenges Māori teachers face, today, in English medium, state-funded schools.
A number of key themes emerged in the participants’ accounts of their teaching experiences.
These themes are related to relevant research and academic literature. Most notably, these
themes draw close attention to Padilla’s (1994) concept of ‘cultural taxation’. The findings
are related to the Articles of the Treaty of Waitangi (1840) and the United Nations’ (2007)
Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples and considered in relation to their national
and international policy implications. Finally, recommendations for future research are
proposed to assist all stakeholders to shape better experiences for Māori teachers in primary
and secondary schools in New Zealand.",,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/7043",,,,"en",,,,,"University of Canterbury.

questions about their diet and physical activity patterns. They reported their
height/weight, and weight-related measurements were taken to calculate the BMI.
Overall, 20.2% of the students were overweight while 8.40% were obese. The

Research largely presents teen mothers as ‘at risk’ parents and high school drop outs, with high rates of welfare dependence. Teen parents are considered unlikely to achieve the educational and economic success of their non-parenting peers. This research considers the impact of the experience at a Teen Parent Unit (TPU) on the ways pregnant and parenting teens understand and achieve success. 

Using a qualitative case study of a Teen Parent Unit in an urban setting in New Zealand, this thesis documents the experiences and perspectives of four young women. Its aim is to detail, explain and interpret the ways these pregnant and parenting teens understand their developing identities as successful students and parents.

Drawing on social constructionist perspectives, the views of the young women participants, and of the researcher have been analysed through a conceptual lens of culturally responsive pedagogical theory. Comparisons are made between the culture of success that has been developed in the Teen Parent Unit setting and that of schools which have engaged in Māori culturally responsive pedagogical practice.

This thesis offers a strengths-based analysis of an environment which, by reframing expectations of success, presents a challenge to negative academic and societal expectations of pregnant and parenting teens. Its goal is to provide educators, social support agencies, education and social policy makers with an analysis of approaches that have made important differences in the lives of the young women and their children.",,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/7157",,,,"en",,,,,"University of Canterbury.

"7623","10092/806",,,"Klomp, Aleisha Margaret",,,,,,,,"2012",,,"Perceptual Motor Programmes are implemented in more than 300 junior schools around New Zealand (Cropp, 2008). When implemented, many teachers believe the programme improves learning including reading abilities, increases physical activity, and enhances social skills (Broadley & Litterick-Biggs, 2005). Despite continued use of the programme there is very little research to support claims of improved academic readiness, and as a result concerns are raised around the use of a non-validated approach to improve children’s literacy learning and learning in general.

This study aimed to examine the effectiveness of a Perceptual Motor Programme on the reading abilities of year one and two children. Participants were 37 year one and two children, aged 5-6 years, from two classes at a low-decile primary school. Children were tested three times over ten weeks of the study using running records and sight word testing as well as non-word reading. One class acted as the control group and did not receive the programme.

Repeated measures ANOVAs revealed a significant time effect over the three time plots for both groups. This time effect is consistent with what you could expect in education where children generally improve over time. However using scores from pre, mid and post testing in all tests, the overall difference between the two groups was non-significant. This result alone clearly disproves the claims of improved reading abilities through the implementation of Smart Starts perceptual motor programme. Sight word testing showed only a marginal time effect due to the scores being high at pre testing creating a ceiling effect where maximum scores had already occurred leaving little room for improvement over time.

When asked to observe one child, teacher observations suggested improved attitudes towards learning and some risk-taking occurring later in the study. This was the case for both children observed, therefore cannot be attributed to the participation of the perceptual motor programme but rather part of the developmental process and current teaching and learning programmes.

The results of this study have implications for the implementation of non-validated interventions in schools. This study outlines the importance of educators using evidence-based practice and research. It explores the purpose, benefits and need for the Smart Starts perceptual motor programme. The use of non-validated approaches take time, money, resources, staffing and energy away from proven practices that improve children’s reading abilities.",,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/7109",,,,"en",,,,,"University of Canterbury.

of the stated materials by key Māori stakeholders balanced against the varied needs of
the second language learner of Te Reo Māori. Adopting this approach to the

It seeks to provide insight from the perspectives of Year 10 students in two classes on their experiences of a particular sexuality education programme.

The purpose of this study was to ‘give voice to’ and explore the experiences of asmall group of nine Year 10 students in their compulsory co-educational sexuality education programme. To this end, the main source of data was focus group interviews with student participants. Students were asked to participate in focus group interviews part way through the unit of work and invited to share their thoughts,
feelings and perceptions of the programme.

The data analysis generated themes that describe student’s experiences in relation to course content, pedagogy and classroom organisation. The analysis of students’ talk
in focus group interviews also showed that gender relations and emotional safety were important features of the students’ experiences of their sexuality education programme. More particularly, it was found that students valued their exposure to this subject and felt that school was a good place to learn about sexuality education. They enjoyed social constructivist teaching approaches that were student-centred and interactive. The students expressed some dissatisfaction with the way in which their sexuality education programme was organised and being delivered. In addition, there was evidence of both male and female students being influenced by traditional, hegemonic constructs of masculinity and femininity, and also a heteronormative culture within the classroom.

The findings present implications for sexuality education teaching in relation to programme development and classroom practice. They suggest that sexuality educators may need to consider the way in which their classrooms are organised, as well as the pedagogical approaches they use, as it appears these aspects have significant influence on the emotional safety of students, on relationships within the
classroom and on the student experience of sexuality education as a whole.",,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/7151",,,,"en",,,,,"University of Canterbury.

"7726","10092/806",,,"Shen, Julia/Ching-Min",,,,,,,,"2012",,,"Within a neo-liberal world polity, the concept of autonomy is increasingly perceived as conducive to postmodern nations’ rational progress in developing knowledge societies. In accordance with global trends, the Taiwanese government implemented a policy of performance-based school management in 2005 to enhance educational accountability, efficiency, equity and quality. This autonomy-based reform perceives all educational stakeholders as self-interested, utility-maximizing market egoists who are capable of realizing their maximum potential by ceaselessly making consumer-style choices. The government assumes that the provision of choices will give everyone an equal chance of educational success.

The negative socio-political consequences brought about by the adoption of neo-liberalism’s beliefs and practices have been explicitly acknowledged and illustrated in the literature. Nonetheless, the ways neo-liberalism has affected Taiwan’s socio-educational reality have scarcely been acknowledged or examined, and even on a theoretical level there has been little thought given to the provision of alternative socio-educational possibilities. Thus, this research, grounded in the context of Taiwan, analyzed neo-liberal ideologies to discover their implications for socio-educational practices. Moral and philosophical insights from various theorists were synthesized and advanced as a substitute for neo-liberalism.

This research was based on the method of deconstruction and reconstruction of textual discourse. For deconstructive analysis, the aim was to investigate and problematize how certain neo-liberal values have come to be globally/nationally institutionalized, and utilized to manipulate citizens’ consciousness for the maximization of economic efficiency, productivity, and profitability in the education market. The reconstructive synthesis, then, aimed to initiate possible socio-educational changes through reconceptualising these same values in respect to Taiwan’s contextual specificity.

Overlooking the need to address neo-liberalism’s belief in individualism, inequitable socio-economic structures and monistic, decontextualised and mechanistic epistemology, the Taiwanese government’s promotion of autonomy was found to perpetuate socio-economic inequalities, power imbalances, human monism and intellectual inflexibility in education.

A shift in epistemology wherein autonomy was reconceptualised as “heteronomous autonomy” was found to be capable of reorienting the overall frame of democratic reference towards a communitarian paradigm that would contribute to greater social equity and solidarity. This finding is extremely important as heteronomous autonomy takes human diversity as its foundation, so the emphasis changes from the rights of the individual to the self’s unconditional responsibility to and for differences. Thus, a
heteronomous-autonomy-based education would forsake neo-liberalism’s standardized pedagogical approaches in favour of a creative framework-in-context. Committing to increased democratic justice and social intellectualism, this alternative education model has more capacity to transform Taiwan into a true knowledge society, where a high level of social cohesion is an absolute precondition.",,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/7175",,,,"en",,,,,"University of Canterbury.

"7751","10092/806",,,"Hindin-Miller, Jennifer Margaret",,,,,,,,"2012",,,"Teenage parenting is widely constructed in prevailing research and public discourse as a social problem, with poor outcomes for parent and child. Teenage parents are regarded as a drain on state funds, too young to parent well, and at high risk of social exclusion, both educationally and economically. This thesis proposes that teenage motherhood is a turning point in a young woman’s life and identity, which can be an opportunity, rather than a problem, if there is adequate support for the mother and her child. It considers the role of a New Zealand School for Teenage Parents in providing this support.
Using qualitative narrative methodology, ten young women, six family members and nine other members of the School community were interviewed about their experiences of its culture and practices. Six of the young women were also interviewed to gather their life stories. Informed by the narrative understanding that we story our identities from the narrative possibilities available to us within the varied discursive contexts of our lives, this thesis draws on these life stories to explore how the young women storied the fashioning of their own identities as young women, as learners and as young parents. It presents their stories of childhood and family life, teenage-hood and schooling, pregnancy and parenthood, their experiences at the School for Teenage Parents, and their lives since leaving the School, in order to consider the role of the School in supporting the positive refashioning of their identities.
This thesis draws on social constructionist and narrative theories to interpret the storied contexts of the young women’s lives, and the role these often constraining and difficult contexts played in the fashioning of their multiple identities. Māori culturally responsive pedagogical theories are also drawn on to interpret the culture of the School for Teenage Parents, and its attempts to provide a supportive and affirming family or whānau environment for its students, in order to offer them more positive narrative possibilities of self and identity as young women, as learners and as young parents.

Year after year, strategic educational documents, policies and services are revisited, reviewed or restructured in order to effect a series of considered and realistic responses that are able to address the inequities that perpetuate for Māori learners. Discussions and debates specific to what needs to change, how this should be done, and who has the authority to decide, continue to be had. Perceptions vary between interested groups about the relevance and appropriateness of much of the research evidence that is drawn on to inform special education policy and practice directions for use with Māori learners. 

This research study investigates two key special education constructs; culturally responsive practice, and evidence based practice. The overall aims are to ascertain what Māori perceive to be the key components that comprise both of these individual terms; to determine if (and how) they are dissimilar or synonymous terms from a Māori perspective; and, to understand how these perceptions differ or are in tandem with special education (western) thinking. It is argued that these terms are regularly defined for Māori by non-Māori, without input or consultation from the former, and that this (in effect) perpetuates a cycle of special education service provision that is unable to respond adequately to, or connect culturally with, Māori realities.

The scene is set wherein a three-circle evidence based practice framework that has been adopted by special education is used (in tandem with the Māori concept of mana), as the structure for selecting the research participants; all of whom are Māori / Māori affiliated. It is my contention that a range of Māori perspectives that are reflective of all of the three types of evidence that special education acknowledges is a worthy starting point for determining parallels and distinctions. From the three evidence domains of research, practice, and whānau, 18 leaders share their respective and collective knowledge, expertise, thoughts and wisdom about the two key constructs. What transpires throughout this study is the emergence of six strong components that are unanimously privileged by these leaders as critical to culturally responsive evidence based special education practice for Māori tamariki and whānau. These components are then drawn on to uncover a range of kaupapa Māori frameworks that are reflective of the participants’ discourses.",,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/7177",,,,"en",,,,,"University of Canterbury.

They may feel isolated or experience a fear of the unknown, and together with expectations of achieving learning outcomes, the student can feel overwhelmed. There is a paucity of literature in how to support the struggling student nurse in the clinical setting. This research utilised a descriptive design methodology to explore the experiences of 14 clinical lecturers who work alongside student nurses while on their clinical practice component of their nursing education programme. The aim of the research was to identify strategies that can be put in place, to support the struggling student nurse in clinical practice. However, for this aim to be plausible, it was also necessary to explore the issues that face the student in this environment. Findings showed: ineffective communication can be a result of low self-confidence, honest and timely feedback is necessary for personal and professional growth, and a lack of continuity in key clinical relationships can be concerning when a student nurse is having difficulty. Being able to identify early, that a student nurse is struggling and offering the right support, can prevent a failed placement.

"7821","10092/806",,,"Fyall, Glenn",,,,,,,,"2012",,,"In the mid to late 1990’s, physical education curriculum writers in New Zealand
challenged the dominant skill mastery approach that was omnipresent in secondary school
physical education. The resulting curriculum documents, Health & Physical Education
(HPE) within the New Zealand Curriculum (Ministry of Education [MOE], 1999) and its
revision, the New Zealand Curriculum (NZC) (MOE, 2007), reflected a
critical/humanistic position with much broader curricular aims and objectives. This
presented many challenges for Physical Education Teacher Education (PETE)
programmes in New Zealand, where it is contested that students entering teacher
education programmes do so with strongly held beliefs that may be difficult to alter.
These entrenched beliefs have the potential to act as filters through which PETE students
acquire knowledge and, therefore, may hinder their ability to consider other views of
teaching and learning. Research suggests that unless these historical personal beliefs are
challenged, teacher education programmes may be considered as weak interventions.
Therefore, the purpose of this study was to investigate the beliefs of a cohort of
graduating physical education teachers around the philosophy and pedagogy inherent in
the NZC (MOE, 2007), having recently completed a four year critically oriented PETE
programme.
A mixed methods (MM) design was employed in the study. A quantitative survey
questionnaire preceded a series of qualitative semi-structured interviews conducted on
five purposively selected participants. The survey questionnaire was used to identify any
inconsistencies between the participants’ beliefs and the intentions reflected in the
curriculum document and the supporting literature. An emphasis was placed on the
qualitative phase of the study, which investigated the key areas of interest identified in the
survey questionnaire. Interview data was then analysed using the process of constant
comparison.
Analysis revealed that the PETE programme may have had some impact on the
philosophical and pedagogical beliefs of the graduating students, and may have
encouraged the participants to explore personal philosophical positions and question
particular decisions regarding their personal beliefs. However, further examination
revealed that the participants were still grappling with the philosophical underpinnings of
the HPE learning area and the pedagogical approaches promoted to support its
implementation.
This research supports the notion that unless historical beliefs about teaching and
learning are deliberately and coherently challenged and confronted through PETE
programme content and pedagogy, these entrenched beliefs may indeed act as knowledge
filters and prevent graduates from making more informed decisions about differing
conceptualisations of physical education curriculum and practice.",,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/7272",,,,"en",,,,,"University of Canterbury.

This research study investigated how Saudi Arabian teachers of adult learners experience learning about teaching during a New Zealand professional development course. It is part of a larger investigation into ways to improve curriculum design for in-service teacher education short courses for international teachers. 

A single case study was undertaken to investigate the views of a group of male Saudi Arabian teachers from tertiary technical institutions while in Aotearoa New Zealand to learn the English language, computing studies and adult education. An interpretive, participant observation method was used involving group interviews, written questionnaire, and personal journal. Focus groups were conducted at the beginning and end of the professional development programme to solicit pre-course expectations, identify post-course views of the in-service teacher education programme, and seek suggestions for improvements for future courses. Using a grounded theory approach, a coded analysis of the findings was conducted drawing out emergent themes from the participants’ comments. 

The findings were grouped into four tensions experienced by the participants. These included, the priority given to learning English language over improving their teaching skills; responding to boredom and lack of student engagement, and difficulties managing student behaviour as part of the student-teacher relationship; a desire to learn new practical teaching methods, rather than being taught the theory of teaching and learning; and differences between the Saudi Arabian and New Zealand learning environments. Responses to these tensions are discussed alongside a framework for high quality learning activities and implications are drawn for improving inter-relationships between teacher and learner. A mismatch was identified between prior expectations and assumptions by the participants and the actual design of the curriculum. 

Cultural issues are discussed in the context of different educational worldviews, including the status and roles of the teacher in Western and Arab societies, employing a critical pedagogy, and curriculum design for teacher professional development. A model is proposed of deliberate acts of culturally responsive teaching which may assist teacher educators in higher education and support the sustainability of in-service professional development for international teachers.",,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/7309",,,,"en",,,,,"University of Canterbury.

He adopted the radical individualism of Nietzsche not in order to be ‘for’ or ‘against’ this or that schooling model but to exemplify the perpetual clash, inherent in mankind, between the individual and the group, the artist and the non-artistic person, the young and the adult, the son and the father and the self and the world.

This study, informed by the Numeracy Development Projects (Ministry of Education 2007a, 2008b) and the work of Pirie and Kieren (1989, 1992, 1994a, 1994b), examines the role of ‘imaging’ in supporting the development of students’ mathematical thinking and understanding. Imaging is an important phase of the teaching model advocated by the Numeracy Development Project. The context of this study is a primary school mathematics programme, which involved the teaching of two mathematics units that focused on the addition and subtraction of decimal fractions and whole numbers. There is considerable research about what is effective in mathematics education for diverse learners, and how students learn. There is, however, very limited research about the role of imaging in mathematical learning.

This qualitative study adopted a case study approach and focused on a group of Year 6 students. Data collection methods included observation, interviews, field notes and document analysis. A thematic approach was used to analyse data and to develop and inform an emerging theoretical framework.

During this study I developed a model, entitled A Model for the Development of Students’ Mathematical Understanding, which illustrates six mathematical resources students use as they solve problems. These resources are: materials, mental picture images, drawn picture images, transformed mental images, transformed drawn images and number properties.

"7633","10092/806",,,"Liu, Keqi",,,,,,,,"2012",,,"This philosophical study is set within Paulo Freire’s radical, critical and liberating pedagogical theoretical discourse. If conscientization is defined by Freire as the cultivation of critical consciousness and conscience, it not only provides a stimulus for better understanding of the root causes of human suffering and dehumanization or the loss of humanity but also brings full effect to humanization, an effective approach to address dehumanization problems. While the cultivation of critical consciousness tackles social system and ideological crises, the cultivation of conscience addresses human consciousness problems such as insatiable human desire represented in varying forms of egoism, ambition, lust, greed, and craving for social status. Thereby, as an educational initiative, conscientization can readily and sustainably maintain both self and social empowerment when it is deeply rooted in the praxis of changing the world. 
The study attempts to achieve three major tasks. The first is to clarify what conscience is and what notion of conscience has internal coherence with the process of conscientization. The second is to determine how to cultivate conscience. The third is to incorporate the cultivation of conscience into conscientization. Like Freire, I draw on a number of different philosophical traditions and perspectives. Where necessary in order to illustrate particular theoretical points, consideration is also given to a number of literary works.
The notion of conscience is explored by tracing its historical development. The dialectical relation between consciousness and conscience − in particular, what causes their conflict − is also examined. The investigation of conscience concludes with identifying conscience as a unifying agent in its dialectical relationship with consciousness. 
The investigation of the dynamism of conscience starts with the confirmation of conscience as the basis of morality. Thereafter, the discussion focuses on why conscience works in a moral sphere, which necessitates a transcendence of blind human biological desire and utilitarian concern for the self. The rationalist tradition of transcendence has undermined, segmented and alienated human life. The transcendent functions of love and dialogue, two ontological ways of human existence, offer an alternative and are justified as the effective mechanisms for cultivating conscience.
However, love and dialogue cannot resist armed injustice and inequality. This calls for the integration of the cultivation of conscience into conscientization. In so doing, the interrelatedness and interdependence between the cultivation of critical consciousness and the cultivation of conscience are examined while their distinctive and irreplaceable roles and functions are further specified. In terms of application, the educational and cultural significance of conscientization for the present and the future and possibilities for applying it to concrete educational discourses are explored.",,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/7129",,,,"en",,,,,"University of Canterbury.

"7075","10092/806",,,"Gikandi, Joyce Wangui",,,,,,,,"2012",,,"Assessment is a key aspect within teaching and learning processes in higher education (Torrance, 2007). Formative assessment may be viewed simply as constructive feedback to support learning or more holistically as ongoing assessment based on sustained engagement in learning activities within a supportive social context that expand teachable moments to scaffold learning. Online education now pervades higher education worldwide but effective ways to incorporate formative assessment within online settings is not well understood. Previous research in online postgraduate courses designed for teachers as professional learners illustrate that engagement with authentic learning activities promotes meaningful learning and transferability to their communities of practice (COP) (e.g. Mackey, 2011). However, there appears to be paucity of literature with a focus on assessment in professional learning. 
This thesis explores formative assessment within online postgraduate courses designed for teachers as professional learners who aim to develop capacity to incorporate information communication technologies (ICT) in their own practice. Case studies are presented to richly illustrate the design, implementation and evaluation of the effectiveness of two courses; and then further re-examined to elucidate strategies and key characteristics that can foster (or hinder) online formative assessment. Authentic and developmental learning perspectives underpinned by situated cognition theory framed the design and interpretation within a multiple-case methodology. Evidence of experiences and perceptions of the teachers and their professional students included online observation, analysis of the discourse, and semi-structured interviews. 
An authentic learning environment that sustained productive engagement is illustrated in both case studies along with many techniques that the teachers designed to underpin formative assessment. A key characteristic in both courses was the design of authentic assessment activities that are relevant and meaningful in real-life contexts. Techniques identified included appropriate learner autonomy, and opportunities to negotiate shared understanding of learning goals and expected outcomes including the sharing of student-created artefacts. The online reification of the artefacts and other learning community support was enabled by the ongoing documentation through creative use of online discussion forums as a feature within the learning management system (LMS). These techniques enriched the processes of ongoing monitoring, assessment of evidence of learning and interactive formative feedback. Both teachers’ beliefs about self and peer feedback also enabled both teachers to design for productive synergies between formative and summative assessment that promoted engagement and deep learning. Additional synergies of discourse among peers related to immediacy, interactivity, and mutuality in which the students recognized themselves and valued their peers as source of constructive feedback. The students also demonstrated meaningful reflectivity that manifested reflexivity within the context of their professional practices.
Online formative assessment is illustrated in both courses as a form of collaborative engagement in authentic learning, including assessment activities with opportunities for ongoing interactions and formative feedback. The open-ended authentic assessment activities supported professional learners to connect the online discourse to their own classroom practices, as well as keenly engage with authentic projects that are situated in their schools. Learner autonomy stimulated self-regulated learning in which students went beyond achievement of the expected learning outcomes for summative assessment to engaging with tasks and processes that matched their own learning goals, interests and contextual needs. Learners’ involvement within formative assessment processes enhanced opportunities to negotiate meanings which fostered shared authenticity.The inherent authenticity in the course design also stimulated application of prior knowledge and experiences in ways that promoted meaningful learning. Engagement in asynchronous dialogue as a community of learners with shared goals and practice elicited alterative perspectives and disorienting dilemmas. This stimulated learners to think in new ways and more critically and to develop relevant professional competencies in ICT. These in turn supported teachers as professional learners to confidently apply their developing pedagogical practices with ICT in their own classrooms; and to share those with school colleagues.
This study illustrates ways that online formative assessment can be designed to support learners to develop relevant knowledge and professional skills that increase professional competencies. Incorporating authentic formative assessment in the course design also impacted teachers’ continuing professional development (CPD), and thus their schools. A key finding from this research is conceptualization of formative assessment as a collaborative pedagogical strategy in which both the teacher and students are active players. This research provides evidence that innovative integration of formative assessment in online settings can support committed professional learners to develop competencies that are transferable into their own practice. This suggests that ongoing formative assessment is an important strategy to increase the quality of online professional development in many fields, in addition to that of education.",,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/7477",,,,"en",,,,,"University of Canterbury.

Can learning in a creative context cause change in students’ writing? 
There is a body of literature that examines the use of drama to facilitate development in literacy, and some of it addresses writing. However, most of the classroom based studies in this literature have been undertaken by drama specialists who have extended their curriculum interests to broader fields such as social studies and literacy. Their work has offered a challenge to classroom teachers who are not drama specialists to explore and adopt relevant process drama approaches.  This study has been conducted by one such teacher and as such it brings a new and different perspective to the research and to the growing body of knowledge. 
The current education system has placed strong importance on managing student levels of achievement in writing with the National Standards being introduced as a way of reporting student progress in this area as well as that of reading and mathematics. The Standards aim to make parents more aware of where their children sit in regards to the National levels. Consequently this thesis adopted an assessment format that incorporated the National Standards to assess change in surface and deeper features of writing.
The students involved in the study were from one Year Five and Six classroom in a decile ten contributing school in Christchurch. They completed questionnaires at the beginning of the study and were interviewed at the end to survey their thoughts on writing and drama. The classroom teacher was also interviewed to gain her views on student levels of motivation in writing and their needs in the classroom. A series of lessons were then facilitated involving the use of process drama to encourage the students to think independently and tell a story through action before they put pencil to paper. Observations were written during each lesson documenting student responses and interactions to the drama and writing samples and student journals were also collected. A systematic analysis was completed on students’ writing to measure change in their writing features over time. These methods were also followed by the classroom teacher in order to measure reliability of the assessment.
Writing samples and student feedback indicated strong improvement in motivation levels and engagement in each task through increased lengths of writing and use of subject-specific vocabulary and emotive language. Results also showed a creative teaching approach can be an effective facilitator of certain aspects of writing in children working at different levels and that the National Standards can be incorporated smoothly and reliably within this type of assessment. 
Overall, the findings from this study highlight the use of drama as an instructional tool in writing and support the conclusion that these strategies can be incorporated into the teaching of writing for more effective instruction.",,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/7546",,,,"en",,,,,"University of Canterbury.

"8356","10092/806",,,"Sadeghi, Amir",,,,,,,,"2013",,,"The research reported in this thesis aimed to investigate potential cognitive-linguistic predictors of reading comprehension levels amongst Persian monolingual and Persian-English bilingual primary school children. The Persian orthography, unlike English, is written from right to left. It is cursive and most of the letters change their shape when connecting to letters on one or both sides. The orthography also has the feature of using marks to represent sounds within the language. These marks are not always included in written text, particularly when the text is targeted at more experienced readers.
Over 200 school-children in Iran from grades 2 to 5 were given measures of text reading comprehension involving Cloze completion or passages followed by questions. Comprehension levels were compared to scores on measures of language competence, phonological ability, orthographic processing and speed of processing. Analyses indicated that Persian reading comprehension levels, consistent with English models of reading, were predicted by measures of linguistic competence and word decoding, with the latter being predicted by phonological and orthographic processing skills. However, orthographic skills and speed of processing showed predictions of Persian reading comprehension independent of word decoding processes, findings that differed to those predicted from the English-language derived models. 
These findings were examined among over 150 Persian-English bilingual children in Persian grades 2 to 5 who attending mainstream schools in New Zealand or Australia. These children were being educated in an English medium context, but with Persian as their home language. Analyses of predictors of reading levels verified the findings reported from the monolingual data. In addition, comparisons of good and poor reading comprehenders argued for deficits in either language or word decoding skills to potentially produce different sub-groups of poor readers, with the findings also being consistent with deficits in phonological decoding and/or orthographic processing skills consistent with dual-route or triangle models of literacy learning disabilities. 
The thesis findings were used to derive a model of Persian reading comprehension similar to the simple view of reading. The findings can also inform the development of cross-language models of reading and global theories of reading comprehension.",,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/7809",,,,"en",,,,,"University of Canterbury.

The study also aimed to show that these interventions could increase children’s preference for previously nonpreferred foods.  Five children and their parents participated.  The interventions delivered to the children were tailored to meet their needs and to fit within the context of their families.  Each of these interventions was composed of antecedent, positive reinforcement and escape extinction strategies.  Parents recorded their children’s food acceptance and disruptive behaviours during each intervention session.  In addition, preference assessments were conducted in order to track changes in the children’s preferences for the target foods.  The results showed that all of the parents were able to introduce at least one new food to their children’s diets during the intervention.  Further, four of the five children showed an improvement in their preference for the targeted foods.  These results were maintained at follow-up, although two of the children had only maintained some of the foods that had been introduced.  All of the parents reported that their children consumed more foods at follow-up than they had during baseline and indicated that they thought the interventions had been effective.

This thesis is a study of communication and collaboration between Somali refugee families and their children’s schools in Christchurch, New Zealand in the light of their experiences pre and post-resettlement in New Zealand. This was to take into account recommendations of the UNHCR Handbook for best practice.  
Informed by interviews with 40 Somali parents, 15 Somali secondary students, two school principals, and 15 teachers, the thesis examines collaboration with schools in the context of the families’ experiences in their home country, the flight process, the refugee camps and the migration and resettlement in New Zealand. 
Data were gathered using questionnaires, individual interviews, focus groups, observation, and document analysis, and subjected to a qualitative analysis.
The study revealed a remarkable degree of heterogeneity among Somali refugee families who have been settling in Christchurch over fourteen years. Many diverse factors were identified such as gender, previous socio-economic status, urban versus rural origins, level of English language, poverty, employable work skills, and refugee experiences such as the level of trauma, all of which have impacted on the capacity of individuals and families to adjust during their resettlement.  Many refugees were identified as having undergone major trauma during the civil war and refugee flight process.
These experiences have affected the integration of many into their new society, but this study found that those with the greatest apparent level of recognised need and vulnerability were those with the poorest communication skill. This resulted in their having a poor relationship with schools and left them quite alienated.  For many such families the only interface with their local school was being summoned to discuss the infractions of their children and any subsequent disciplinary measures. Therefore, one of the greatest needs to improve communication and collaboration was identified as the ability to learn the English language. 
Other barriers to successful communication and collaboration included issues associated with racism, cultural awareness, teacher workload, lack of acknowledgement of refugees’ special needs in school policies, teachers’ low expectations of refugee parents, intimidating school environments, ambiguous information, the Somali oral culture, parents’ financial hardship, parents’ lack of  transport, parents’ workload, inadequate housing and the families’ high mobility.
There are currently neither national policies nor adequate resources to facilitate refugees improving their English language skills, nor to support schools in other aspects of their communication and collaboration with refugee families, and this study suggests that the absence of guidelines and resourcing is another key factor behind the poor engagement between the families and schools.  Schools and their teachers also need good professional development that takes account of the diverse needs of these families in order to help build and strengthen better working relationships with refugee families. 
The thesis goes on to discuss the current models of parent-school collaboration, and it concludes by presenting a proposed new empowerment model of parent-school collaboration which is tailored to help support refugee families.  Key tenets of the proposed new model are that there must be principals who provide committed leadership and support, by meeting and welcoming parents when children are enrolled, providing follow-up meetings after enrolment, and developing structures, policies and guidelines to promote parent-school collaboration. They need to provide adequate resources to educate school personnel and mainstream parents about the refugees’ culture and experiences, and a designate a co-ordinator with responsibility for creating an inclusive environment with positive ethnic relations, while conducting monitoring and evaluation of the effectiveness of these measures on communication and collaboration.  The model also suggests that there should be greater inter-agency co-ordination and co-operation between the schools and organisations such as health services, social services, WINZ, NZIS and the Police. Implementing the proposed model would build on existing social capital to result in adults and children who are more actively involved not only in education, but also in health care and social and recreational activities where the school is the hub for empowering those families which are most at risk.",,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/7465",,,,"en",,,,,"University of Canterbury.

"8006","10092/806",,,"Howell, Jamie Robert",,,,,,,,"2012",,,"The Tracks rites of passage are processes that mark the adolescent transition, for the participant, the family and the community, between the two life stages of childhood and adulthood. Adolescent initiation rites offer a community led journey of separation, transition and integration as a way to work meaningfully with adolescents as they move between the life stages of childhood into adulthood. In Aotearoa/New Zealand the Tracks programme provides a five day contemporary rite of passage for adolescents and, where possible, their fathers. The rite of passage is based on the assumption that adolescents need opportunities to find their voices and make meaning if they are to become more aware of who they are and where they belong. 

The methodology recognises that I, as researcher and insider in the Tracks organisation, needed to develop a holistic approach to insider research so that I could call on my understandings of the organisation and also guard against bias. The holistic approach involves the four interpenetrating strategies of appreciative inquiry, narrative inquiry, a blend of approaches to self-study that include meditation and critical reflection, and most importantly organic inquiry. The four strategies are based on coherence theories that describe learning as being organic, interconnected and emergent. Data were gathered from interviews and cycles of critical self-reflection in the form of a learning journal. 

Data comes from interviews with the mother or fathers and young men of six families who have participated in the Tracks rite of passage programme.  I have also discussed this work with a number of professionals in the field of youth work. The project found that Tracks had created conditions that empowered these young men with an increased capacity to make sense of their lives. Fathers expressed how challenging and rewarding they had found it to speak in honest terms with their sons, and that they were supported to do the inner work necessary to be able to speak in such ways. All of the family members expressed a need to have more support after the event. 

The findings suggest a need to explore further the nature of the work happening at Tracks. It validates Lashlie’s (2005) theory that adolescents need their fathers and other men to be involved in their lives at the time of transition.  Tracks also helps fathers to get to grips with the inner work of developing emotional maturity. The work happening at Tracks invites further research into and debate on the value of emotional intelligence. The Tracks rite of passage offers an alternative perspective to understand the unacceptably high rates of adolescent morbidity and mortality happening in New Zealand.",,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/7611",,,,"en",,,,,"University of Canterbury.

(2000) Business Studies Curriculum in Samoa. McGee (1997) states that
curriculum as a field is concerned with making decisions about what is the most
worthwhile knowledge for students to learn, why they should learn it and how
they should learn it. The aim of this study was to find out teachers’ views on
teaching the reviewed Business Studies Curriculum in secondary schools which
was drafted and documented by the Samoan Ministry of Education, Sports and
Culture (MESC)
Commercial Studies when it was first introduced in 1986 was a syllabus in Years
9, 10 and 11 (an outline of topics such as banking, shipping, transportation,
insurance, exports and imports, employment, manufactures with one or two
accounting topics). This clearly indicated an imbalance of topics between
economics and accounting in all levels especially in Year 11 where it was all pure
accounting. Students’ books were the only curriculum materials prepared and
available for teachers to teach this old syllabus. In 2000, the Ministry of
Education made changes and developments to its educational system where
Commercial Studies changed its name to Business Studies, a combination of
both economics and accounting topics to be taught in Years 9, 10 and 11 and
become two separate subjects in Years 12 and 13.
McGee (1997) believes that teachers are key curriculum decision makers. They
make a number of decisions with respect to the implementation of any given
curriculum and to reach these decisions, they need to take into account the
learning abilities of their students, the curriculum documents, resources available
and their own strengths. Teaching is a continuous activity; a teacher is in the
middle or center of the class (a group of students) and the center of the
classroom. (National Committee of Inquiry to Higher Education, 1997).
The purpose of this research was to find out how Business Studies teachers
made sense in using the curriculum materials to implement the new Business
Studies curriculum. This study was conducted in two colleges in Samoa, one
government (a school owned and operated by the Samoan government) and one
mission (school owned and operated by the Samoan Congregational Christian
Church). These schools were chosen because this would provide comparison of
views of teachers who were teaching the Business Studies Curriculum. The
information was collected from three visits per school, two teachers who were
teaching Business Studies in Years 9, 10 and 11 were selected from each
school. The first visit was to brief teachers at the start reminding them of the
purpose of the research, reassure them of the confidentiality of their contributions
and explain my approach. The second visit was the individual interviews with
each teacher and the third visit was observation during classroom teaching.",,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/7530",,,,"en",,,,,"University of Canterbury.

"7587","10092/806",,,"Gowan, Monica Elizabeth",,,,,,,,"2011",,,"One of the great challenges facing human systems today is how to prepare for, manage, and adapt successfully to the profound and rapid changes wreaked by disasters.  Wellington, New Zealand, is a capital city at significant risk of devastating earthquake and tsunami, potentially requiring mass evacuations with little or short notice.  Subsequent hardship and suffering due to widespread property damage and infrastructure failure could cause large areas of the Wellington Region to become uninhabitable for weeks to months.

Previous research has shown that positive health and well-being are associated with disaster-resilient outcomes.  Preventing adverse outcomes before disaster strikes, through developing strengths-based skill sets in health-protective attitudes and behaviours, is increasingly advocated in disaster research, practise, and management.  This study hypothesised that well-being constructs involving an affective heuristic play vital roles in pathways to resilience as proximal determinants of health-protective behaviours. Specifically, this study examined the importance of health-related quality of life and subjective well-being in motivating evacuation preparedness, measured in a community sample (n=695) drawn from the general adult population of Wellington’s isolated eastern suburbs.

Using a quantitative epidemiological approach, the study measured the prevalence of key quality of life indicators (physical and mental health, emotional well-being or “Sense of Coherence”, spiritual well-being, social well-being, and life satisfaction) using validated psychometric scales; analysed the strengths of association between these indicators and the level of evacuation preparedness at categorical and continuous levels of measurement; and tested the predictive power of the model to explain the variance in evacuation preparedness activity.  This is the first study known to examine multi-dimensional positive health and global well-being as resilient processes for engaging in evacuation preparedness behaviour.  

A cross-sectional study design and quantitative survey were used to collect self-report data on the study variables; a postal questionnaire was fielded between November 2008 and March 2009 to a sampling frame developed through multi-stage cluster randomisation.  The survey response rate was 28.5%, yielding a margin of error of +/- 3.8% with 95% confidence and 80% statistical power to detect a true correlation coefficient of 0.11 or greater.

In addition to the primary study variables, data were collected on demographic and ancillary variables relating to contextual factors in the physical environment (risk perception of physical and personal vulnerability to disaster) and the social environment (through the construct of self-determination), and other measures of disaster preparedness.  These data are reserved for future analyses.
Results of correlational and regression analyses for the primary study variables show that Wellingtonians are highly individualistic in how their well-being influences their preparedness, and a majority are taking inadequate action to build their resilience to future disaster from earthquake- or tsunami-triggered evacuation.  At a population level, the conceptual multi-dimensional model of health-related quality of life and global well-being tested in this study shows a positive association with evacuation preparedness at statistically significant levels.  However, it must be emphasised that the strength of this relationship is weak, accounting for only 5-7% of the variability in evacuation preparedness.  

No single dimension of health-related quality of life or well-being stands out as a strong predictor of preparedness.  The strongest associations for preparedness are in a positive direction for spiritual well-being, emotional well-being, and life satisfaction; all involve a sense of existential meaningfulness.  Spiritual well-being is the only quality of life variable making a statistically significant unique contribution to explaining the variance observed in the regression models.  Physical health status is weakly associated with preparedness in a negative direction at a continuous level of measurement.  No association was found at statistically significant levels for mental health status and social well-being. These findings indicate that engaging in evacuation preparedness is a very complex, holistic, yet individualised decision-making process, and likely involves highly subjective considerations for what is personally relevant.  Gender is not a factor.  Those 18-24 years of age are least likely to prepare and evacuation preparedness increases with age.

Multidimensional health and global well-being are important constructs to consider in disaster resilience for both pre-event and post-event timeframes.  This work indicates a need for promoting self-management of risk and building resilience by incorporating a sense of personal meaning and importance into preparedness actions, and for future research into further understanding preparedness motivations.",,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/7605",,,,"en",,,,,"University of Canterbury.

V-ball is a modified netball game in which five on-court players per team gain experience in three varying roles due to the implementation of positional rotation. This study investigates players’ perceptions of self-satisfaction and team cohesion in netball, a modified netball game (V-ball) or both games. Self-satisfaction has been viewed in terms of individuals’ basic psychological need satisfaction (BPNS). Team cohesion has been considered in light of youths’ perceptions of task and social cohesion as identified in previous research.
In the current study a mixed methodology was implemented and a process of purposive sampling was used to recruit 63, 11-12 year old participants from Whangarei, New Zealand. Participants had varying degrees of experience in either sport, which determined their placement in one of three groups; netball, V-ball or both games. All participants completed a quantitative questionnaire, results of which were analysed using a one-way ANOVA. A total of 12 questionnaire participants, representative of each group, then took part in a one-on-one semi-structured qualitative interview. Interview data was transcribed verbatim and analysed through a manual coding process. 
Three key findings have emerged: the extent of game structure was found to affect the fun experienced by youth participants, the presence of external regulation (from significant others) was identified to contribute to orientations of extrinsic motivation and winning orientations were found to have a negative effect on participants’ perceptions of team cohesion. These findings provide new information regarding players’ perceptions as a result of participation in netball and V-ball in New Zealand. These findings also contribute to those of previous research on the perceptions of youth as a result of participation in traditional and modified games.",,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/7606",,,,"en",,,,,"University of Canterbury.

Its focus is on investigating the effects of cooperative learning on students' English language proficiency, learning motivation and social skills, in comparison with traditional whole-class instruction, by employing a pre-test-post-test control group quasi-experimental design. 
   The first chapter clarifies the context for the research, which includes an introduction about the importance of English language teaching in China, a description of the widely used traditional approach, as well as its negative consequences. Observations are made regarding the characteristics of College English teaching and recent nationwide College English reform, which have spurred a transformation of the traditional approach at the tertiary level, with a focus on enhancing students' listening and speaking abilities in English. This is followed by a brief overview of cooperative learning, as well as its potential to contribute to College English teaching. The overall aim of the research and the specific research questions addressed are presented at the end of this chapter.  
   The second chapter consists of a review of the literature regarding the history of cooperative learning, the fundamental theoretical underpinnings of cooperative learning, major cooperative learning methods, basic elements of cooperative learning, and its positive outcomes. This chapter also elaborates on key issues in implementing cooperative learning in the classroom and the cultural appropriateness of cooperative learning in China. In accordance with the specific context for this research, this chapter addresses the relevant connections of cooperative learning to second and foreign language teaching, tertiary education, and large-class instruction. An extensive review is also included regarding recent studies on using cooperative learning in second and foreign language teaching around the world as well as in China. The review locates a gap in the existing studies; the effectiveness of cooperative learning in teaching English as a foreign language to tertiary learners in China, which constitutes the focus of this thesis. 
   The third chapter starts with some key concepts essential for quantitative methodology used in this research. It is followed by an introduction of participants and the general research procedure, which includes a pilot study and a main study employing a pre-test-post-test control group quasi-experimental design. Details of the intervention procedure are provided, focusing on different teaching methods used in the cooperative learning classroom and the traditional classroom. This chapter also provides details of the three measures used in this research: the College English Test, the Language Learning Orientations Scale, and the Social Skills Scale for Chinese College English Learners. At the end of the chapter there is an explanation of specific techniques and principles for data analysis.
   In chapter four, results are presented based on analysis of the data from the three measures. In general, the results focus on seven aspects: mean scores, standard deviations of pre- and post-test scores for each group, effect sizes of Cohen's d from pre- to post-test for each group, alpha values of paired-samples t-tests for each group, alpha values of interaction effect between group and time from ANOVAs, alpha values of post-test difference between groups from one way ANCOVAs, and means plots for each of testing areas. The findings provide evidence in favour of cooperative learning in some areas, for instance, in teaching speaking, listening and reading, in generating intrinsic motivation, and in incorporating students' equal participation and individual accountability into learning. 
   The final chapter includes a discussion of the findings on the three measures in relation to the findings of previous research. It goes on to discuss implications for the practice of English language teaching, with a focus on the challenges of using cooperative learning in Chinese tertiary institutions. These challenges mainly include designing appropriate cooperative learning tasks, extra workload involved in preparing and implementing cooperative learning lessons, limited teaching hours and a large curriculum to cover, as well as students' use of the first language in teamwork. The chapter ends with a discussion about the major contributions and limitations of the current study, as well as recommendations for future research.",,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/5188",,,,"en",,,,,"University of Canterbury.

is a growing interest amongst psychologists, counsellors, and
educationists. The purpose of this study has been to provide a rich
description of the perspectives and experiences of parents raising gifted
and talented children in New Zealand.
Parents who live and care for a child with special talents or abilities face
a great number of different stressors compared with parents who have a
‘normal’ or ‘average’ child (Clark, 2008; Delisle, 2001; May, 2000).
Research suggests that recognizing and dealing with gifted children’s
advanced intellectual, social, emotional and motor skills which are
different from average ability children pose challenges in parenting gifted
children (Moon & Hall, 1998; Moon, 2003; Moon, Jurich & Feldhusen,
1998; Silverman & Kearney, 1989).
There has been little research conducted into the experiences of parents
with young gifted children in New Zealand. This thesis therefore seeks to
find out the parents’ views on and their experiences of having young
gifted children and understand how and what meaning they construct
around living with their children. The purpose of this study therefore has
been aimed at listening to the voices of parents whose children are
identified as intellectually gifted and also to look at the actual experience
of these parents who have the greatest influence in their gifted children’s
lives.
Using a qualitative phenomenology study, four parents with a young
intellectual gifted child were interviewed about their parenting
experiences. The perspectives and experiences of these parents have
been analyzed from multiple perspectives. In-depth interviewing and
analytical memos have provided a rich picture of the experiences and
perspectives of these parents with their gifted and talented children. It is
ix
from these insights that some clarity has been gained about the
understanding and challenges that these parents faced when raising
gifted and talented children, and how they are interpreted by the
participants
This thesis explores the participants’ understanding of parenting a young
intellectually gifted child, discusses similarities to and differences from
general parenting, and describes the outcomes of the four parents in this
study. It highlights four systematic problems that complicate their
parenting: (a) community lack of support (b) education inequalities (c)
difficulties in the gifted support service, and (d) social stigma. This thesis
also draws attention to the need for counsellors, psychologists, and
expertise in gifted education to address the issues and get an
understanding of the challenges that the parents of the gifted children
are faced with when they are parenting a child with special needs.",,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/7672",,,,"en",,,,,"University of Canterbury.

The thesis tracks how Pasifika theatre matured, and characterises this in four broad developmental stages. The first Pasifika plays were positioned within a monocultural environment, sharing their initial energy with Maori theatre. The second stage broke away from Maori theatre to have a more specific focus on Pasifika cultural issues. The third stage saw a flourishing of popular Pasifika theatre, with a Pan-Pasifika ideology. While in the first three stages there was a particular focus on migration, the fourth stage has seen a move toward issues that are more contemporary. Topics examined include gender, ethnicity, and the individuality of a community that has increasingly acculturated into New Zealand society. At the moment they are less connected with their ethnic and cultural roots; they are also showing more awareness of their position in New Zealand society.
Pasifika theatre makers identified with a larger Pan-Pasifika community, differentiating themselves from the Maori and European populations in New Zealand. At the same time, theatre makers used indigenous traditions, Western realist theatre conventions, and popular cultural references to comment on the socio-economic position of Pasifika people, and to entertain Pasifika audiences. For subsequent generations of Pasifika theatre makers, migration and its aftermath formed the primary master narrative, even though Pasifika people increasingly acculturated to New Zealand society. Consequently, new hybrid identities developed, which have become more prominent in Pasifika plays. Pasifika theatre attracts a growing number of European theatre goers who seek a safe encounter with the Other. Indeed, sixty years after the first waves of migration, Pasifika theatre makers still feel like outsiders in New Zealand’s bicultural framework.",,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/7675",,,,"en",,,,,"University of Canterbury.

It focuses on the steps taken to move the school towards inclusion, the practices and experiences of different stakeholders involved in the process, and the factors that influenced inclusive education in the school.
Qualitative data was collected through interviews with some of the key members of the school community and through classroom observations and documents. Findings have revealed that the development of inclusive education in the school came about through a school leader rather than policies. In spite of recognized efforts towards inclusion, a range of exclusionary practices was still observed. Various impediments constrained the development of inclusive education, including, lack of collaboration between the SEN (Special Educational Needs) and the general staff, limited knowledge, awareness and positive understanding about inclusion, scarcity of resources and support services. Factors such as large classes, undifferentiated curriculum, and rigid time tables also negatively affected the developmental process. 
Findings indicate the complexity of developing inclusive education. The findings also suggest that changes on the societal level, in the education ministry and, in the school and classroom level could help sustain the development of inclusive education. The factors that could contribute to the development of inclusive education at these levels are discussed, as are the implications for the successful development of inclusive education in schools.",,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/7702",,,,"en",,,,,"University of Canterbury.

"8458","10092/806",,,"Wong, Alice Su Chu",,,,,,,,"2012",,,"The three studies reported in this thesis investigated the contributing factors of L2 writing among adult ESL learners in the academic setting. The major purpose of this research was to explore the relationship between L2 proficiency, writing strategies, writing attitude, writing errors and L2 writing performance. This thesis aimed to provide insights for the contributing factors that are predictive of L2 writing performance in adult ESL learners, studying in English and non-English dominant settings. 
Study 1 (reported in Chapter 3) focused on determining the appropriate measures for investigating the individual factors of writing performance; particularly learners’ writing strategies, learners’ second language proficiency, first language (L1) interference and their relation to writing performance. Thirty-one intermediate students of L2 served as participants. A measure of vocabulary size and a writing strategy questionnaire were administered to the students. Findings in this study indicated that most of the participants’ planning strategies were limited to having a mental or written plan whereas over half of the respondents reported that they always start with an introduction and were more likely to stop drafting after a few sentences. In terms of drafting strategies, it was found that most respondents reread what they had written to get ideas on how to continue but did not go back to their outline to make changes in it. With regard to L1 use, a majority of participants do not write bits of text in their native language. Nevertheless, quite a number of participants indicated that they would write in their L1 if they don’t know a word in English. Findings in this study also suggested that participants’ biggest concerns were related to grammar and vocabulary, which resulted in them making surface level changes and checking. An overall analysis of participants’ writing output and responses from the questionnaire also provided important insights to the improvement of the measures. The revision process included rewording and rephrasing ambiguous items, removing irrelevant items from the questionnaire and restructuring the writing task for the next study.
In Study 2 (presented in Chapter 4), a follow-up study was conducted to examine L2 writers’ proficiency level, writing attitude, writing errors and writing strategies in an English-dominant setting. Nine research questions were designed to guide the study framework and gather specific data regarding the research aims. A writing measure, vocabulary tests and a questionnaire were administered to the students. Findings from Study 2 indicated that L2 proficiency, particularly vocabulary size, was related to writing performance. In addition, it was also discovered that L2 writers who performed poorly were prone to performing writing strategies related to surface level checking. Therefore, it was concluded that linguistic barriers in L2 affect both writing performance and students’ ability in applying the effective strategies in writing.  Apart from that, Study 2 also found that the use of L1 and translation into L2 was associated with lower writing performance. Additionally, Study 2 found that pronoun, word and sentence errors were the most prevalent errors among ESL students. A possible reason for this is because L2 students need to work with two languages while writing, mainly the grammar rules in English which are not found in their L1 as well as their own native language.  Thus, L2 students face the challenge of working out English grammar rules while writing. Overall, findings in this study suggest that prevalent writing errors in English may be a sign of L1 interference and that as the use of L1 increases, writing performance decreases. 

In Study 3 (reported in Chapter 5), the role of proficiency level, writing attitude, writing errors and writing strategies was explored by measuring the relationship between writing attitude scores, errors in writing, strategy use and essay scores. Additionally, the role of L2 proficiency in writing performance was also investigated by assessing the relationship between vocabulary size scores, writing errors and writing performance. Findings from Study 3 revealed unexpected findings with regard to the relationship between L1 use and writing performance among the three sample groups. L1 use was found to be correlated with writing performance for Group A but not Groups B and C. It was argued that L2 writers of different L2 proficiency level and academic experience may have different orientations of L1 use. Further work on the impact of L1 use on L2 writing will be needed in order to provide insights into this area. With regard to writing errors, a relationship between errors and writing performance was reported. It was found that subject verb agreement error appeared to be a common factor for the three groups in the study that was related to writing performance. In addition, errors were also significantly correlated with L2 proficiency, suggesting that as L2 proficiency increased, errors decreased. Overall, Study 3 argues for the importance of developing and enhancing learners’ L2 proficiency to reduce errors and improve learners’ writing performance. Additionally, Study 3 also argues for the need to emphasize effective writing strategies in the ESL writing classroom.",,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/7837",,,,"en",,,,,"University of Canterbury.

Chronic illnesses are enduring and often cannot be cured, requiring a strategy for long term management and intervention to prevent further exacerbation. Globally, there has been an increase in interventions using telecommunications technologies to aid patients in their home setting to manage chronic illnesses. Such interventions have often been delivered by nurses. The purpose of this research was to assess whether a particular intervention that had been successfully implemented in the United Kingdom could also be implemented in Canterbury. In particular, this research assessed the perspectives of Canterbury based practice nurses and district nurses. The findings suggest that a majority of both district and practice nurses did not view the service as compatible with their current work situation. Existing workload and concerns over funding of the proposed service were identified as potential barriers. However, the service was perceived as potentially beneficial for some, with the elderly based in rural areas, or patients with chronic mental health needs identified as more likely to benefit than others. Practice nurses expressed strong views on who should deliver such services. Given that it was identified that practice nurses already have in-depth knowledge of their patients’ health, while valuing the strong relationships established with their communities, it was  suggested that patients would most benefit from locally based nurses to deliver any community based health  services in the future. It was also found that teletriaging is currently widely used by practice nurses across Canterbury to meet a range of health needs, including chronic mental health needs. This suggests that the scope of teletriaging in community health and its potential and full implications are currently not well understood in New Zealand. Significant events, such as the Christchurch earthquakes indicate the potential role of teletriaging in addressing mental health issues, thereby reducing the chronic health burden in the community.",,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/7645",,,,"en",,,,,"University of Canterbury.

The participants were volunteers from two parallel classes of secondary school students working toward Level 1 Building Construction and Allied Trade Skills Certificate designed for secondary schools by the Building Construction Industry Training Organisation. The participant researcher was also the teacher for both classes.
Data in this case study was collected by observation, reflective journal writing, student records, group discussion and analysis of student course results. It showed that the students responded positively to the blended classroom environment and the interactive online resources developed by the researcher for this study. 
The blended learning environment in the classroom increased student participation, aided classroom management, and more than halved the time needed for both classes to finish the Instrumental Drawing Unit Standard 7502 while the interactive online resources enhanced student engagement and achievement in other areas of their theory. Students responded positively to the automated formative feedback and were encouraged by knowing their results instantly; working to gain top results and correct answers rather than just completing an activity by filling in the blanks. A competitive element was introduced by integrating a timer into the resources.
Challenges encountered included limited access to computers and the necessity for students to share computers, a network failure which made the online resources unavailable for an extended period, and storage problems for the online resources to allow them to be accessed from the online learning environment at school and at home.
This study concluded that technology can enable teachers to enhance their teaching and enrich the student learning environment through the introduction of a variety of media. Students still depended on face-to-face teacher input but, in the blended classroom environment and the online environment, the role of the teacher changed noticeably to a role of facilitator.",,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/7873",,,,"en",,,,,"University of Canterbury.

Those needing palliative care needed someone to speak for them and ensure they received the care they needed and deserved. Today, more than forty years later, the voice of the patient and family are in danger of being lost. This research aimed to discover what patients and their families thought were the most important priorities in palliative care. If hospices, and any other facility that cares for the dying, are to give the care that patients and their families need then the research in this thesis shows benefit to those patients and families if asked to identify what are their needs. If palliative care is to be truly holistic we need to find out from patients, and from their families, what they believe is important.
Using purposeful sampling, five patients and five family members were recruited from a hospice in-patient unit. In-depth interviews with open-ended questions were conducted with participants who were asked to share what had affected their care, or their relative’s care, while admitted to the hospice. These interviews were recorded and transcribed in a qualitative descriptive study to identify and analyse what these participants described as the ‘important thing’ in palliative care. Specific, tangible detail was sought in order to define the ‘essence’ of palliative care as determined by those receiving it. Thematic analysis revealed four key themes and associated sub-themes relating to: the people who work in a hospice; the environment; philosophy and holistic care. 
This research enables those caring for the dying in any context, to use the information shared by these individuals as guidance to enhance the care they offer to a dying person so that their final days may be more tolerable, even perhaps pleasurable: to help them ‘live until they die’.",,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/8445",,,,"en",,,,,"University of Canterbury.

"8538","10092/806",,,"Murray, Megan Nicolle",,,,,,,,"2013",,,"This study investigated associate teachers and student teachers perspectives of ‘successful’ mentoring. It aimed to understand how a group of associate teachers, who had been identified as being successful, viewed their role, looking at what it was that they specifically did that they felt made them successful when mentoring student teachers. It then compared these perspectives with those of a group of student teachers. The aim of the comparison was to establish any agreements or contradictions between the associate teachers’ and the student teachers’ perspectives about ‘successful’ associate teachers. An additional aim was to establish knowledge of particular professional development experiences that the associate teachers of this study felt had positively impacted on their practice as mentors. 
Four ‘successful’ associate teachers, as identified by their visiting lecturers from within the University of Canterbury, College of Education, and five student teachers who were enrolled at the same university in one of the primary programmes at the time of the study, were interviewed regarding their perspectives. The data revealed three conceptual themes as being relevant to ‘successful’ mentoring of student teachers: acquiring professional knowledge, becoming a professional through practice – teaching the student teacher, and building professional relationships. 
Findings of this study suggest that pivotal to ‘successful’ mentoring is the establishment of a successful working relationship between the associate teacher and the student teacher. The study identified that the mentoring relationship is more likely to be viewed as being ‘successful’ if associate teachers demonstrate certain knowledge, dispositions and practices when mentoring student teachers. Findings also highlighted the vital role that communication plays in supporting this relationship, not only between the associate teacher and the student teacher, but also the significant impact that effective communication on behalf of the initial teacher education provider has. The findings of this study calls for a review into the way that initial teacher education providers communicate with associate teachers, suggesting that providers should introduce a face to face element to communication.  
What became apparent through this study was the conclusion that there were excellent examples of ‘successful’ associate teachers, including those that were interviewed for this study, who were mentoring student teachers. Initial teacher education providers need to draw from this wealth of knowledge by increasing the opportunities where they facilitate discussions between themselves and associate teachers, in order to ensure that they are supporting the professional growth of their student teachers. 
It is my hope that the findings of this study will help to inform initial teacher education providers about the mentoring of their student teachers and hopefully result in improved outcomes for student teachers in the future.",,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/7898",,,,"en",,,,,"University of Canterbury.

"6723","10092/806",,,"Hakai Soti, Fa'amoemoe",,,,,,,,"2011",,,"This is a practical experience study to examine the perspectives and experiences of the teachers, students and parents towards teaching and learning Home Economics or Food and Textiles Technology (FTT) in Secondary schools in Samoa.  The study attempts to understand the major factors that impede the successful implementation of the Food and Textiles Technology teaching and learning in the classroom.

The research methodology of the study is drawn from qualitative case study approaches.  Teachers, students and parents were interviewed and observed to gather relevant data for the study.  Additional research includes analysis of educational documents to assist in creating a well-developed view of the FTT teaching.

The study showed that though a great deal of research is being done to address identified needs in the Samoan education system, little work has been done in the area of home economics/food and textile technology.  Additionally, the promotion of technical assistance through the vocational education training programmes is relevant for Samoa but it has not been addressed adequately in the change literature.  This study attempts to contribute to meeting these two needs.

The important findings of the study address innovation and support for all curriculum areas.  The FTT innovation is a component of the Samoan education system, however, it is still regarded by many Samoans as a ‘second–class’ option in relation to formal education rather than ‘second chance education’ (Jones 1994; and Sharma 1995).  Many Samoans accustomed to academic education regard FTT as a low status subject, a belief that is shared by many parents.  In some countries women are considered second-class citizens but it is clear that ‘second chance’ education provides an equal opportunity to educate everyone and to provide a safe, respectful and nurturing environment.  In addition, the opportunity of a second chance education can enhance the options available for early school leavers.

The Ministry of Education Sports and Culture (MESC) needs to develop strategic policies to strengthen its approaches to the implementation of FTT in the secondary school.  It is clear that teaching and learning FTT in schools in Samoa is not a compulsory component of the school system.  It is only taken by the schools with resources, a trained teacher and enrolled students who are willing to participate in these courses.  The MESC policies are related to its shared vision of a change process that provides teachers with strategies to achieve the desired goal or a set of goals.  Therefore MESC policies should be flexible, usable, timely and applicable to the teaching and learning of FTT.
Very importantly, the supply of pre- service and in- service training of teachers by MESC is needed to ensure there is a pool of high quality teachers to provide the successful implementation of FTT in the secondary school curriculum.

It is also clear and understood that MESC should provide the appropriate quality resources to the learners to ensure the effective delivery of the FTT programmes in the secondary schools.  Normally, FTT is expensive but this should not prevent or limit students’ access to the programmes.  All efforts should be made to make the programmes accessible to all students.  In order for the implementation of FTT to be successful, all the stakeholders should be active participants of the change process in the FTT programmes and all these programmes should be high quality, sustainable and on going.

In the light of the above findings, it is important for the MESC, principals, teachers and stakeholders to participate and appreciate FTT implementation as a learning opportunity to develop new concepts, skills and behaviour (Huberman and Miles 1984; Joyce and Showers 1998; Fullan, 1991).  These interactive and cumulative learning processes have important implications, which are addressed in this study in relation to the numerous target groups involved.",,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/6289",,,,"en",,,,,"University of Canterbury.

Deciding on where to live is a major dilemma for them. What are the factors that contribute to this making this life-changing decision? How do older people cope with the transition to new accommodation? 
This research considers the experience of older people who have made the shift to a retirement complex. It also contemplates their attitudes and perceptions and those of older people who may, at some point in their lives, have this decision taken from them and find they are directed into care. The focus of the research was to hear and record the ‘voice’ of a purposeful sample of older people by exploring their experience of shifting into one of four levels at retirement complexes; villa, serviced apartment, resthome or hospital. The research also delved into the attitudes towards a potential shift of those who remain in their family home. 
Thirty-five participants, ranging in age from 66 to 95-years were located into three groups according to their living situation. They were interviewed using an unstructured interview process and information from these interviews was catergorised into sixteen themes. The data were sifted through, in order to discover similarities and differences between participants and groups. Findings were then compared with available literature to offer further endorsement or to proffer an alternative perspective to the existing information.

Postgraduate education is gaining momentum in NZ as Registered Nurses (RN) choose this
pathway to advance their nursing careers, and is recognised as mandatory for RNs working in
expanded practice roles and Nurse Practitioners (NP) to meet Nursing Council New Zealand
(NZ) competencies. RNs participate in Post graduate study (PGS) while working, and while
those employed by NZ District Health Boards (DHB), who meet the criteria, may be eligible
for Health Workforce NZ (HWNZ) funding, but for various reasons large numbers of RNs
are forced to self-fund their PGS. A literature review identified a gap in the NZ nursing
literature regarding the RNs experience of the PGS journey. This study goes some way to
address this gap.

Method
A qualitative descriptive methodology was used to describe and explore the PG journeys of
RNs. Using a purposeful sampling, twelve RNs were interviewed. A thematic analysis of the
transcribed interviews was undertaken to identify key themes.

Findings
The study’s findings identified the challenges these nurses experienced, juggling their
study/work/family obligations to commit to PGS. They spoke of sacrificing time with friends
and family, sacrificing annual leave when study leave was not forth coming, or having to
negotiate with employer to continue their PGS and being unprepared for the pressures of the
academic environment. Relying heavily on family and colleagues for support, they navigated
successful completion of their PGS, acknowledging the achievements and gains from PGS.

Conclusion
Findings from this study reflect findings from similar studies in Australia, UK and Ireland,
indicating that RNs continue to experience the same issues and challenges to achieve a PG
education. Given the push from within the profession for RNs to complete PG education,
nurse educators, nurse employers and policy developers must engage with nurses to improve
the PGS experience for RNs.",,,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/15114",,,"en","English",,,,"University of Canterbury",,,,,,,"http://library.canterbury.ac.nz/thesis/etheses_copyright.shtml","All Rights Reserved",,,,,,,,,,,,"Postgraduate study : the journey for registered nurses.",,,"Electronic Thesis or Dissertation",,,"Health Sciences","University of Canterbury",,"Masters",,,"Master of Health Sciences",,,,,"College of Education, Health and Human Development, University of Canterbury",,"jkgroube@gmail.com",,,,,,,,,"Kate Reid"

These case studies describe and analyze the students’ self-identified goals and motivations for participating in this study abroad experience.  Utilization of Lincoln and Guba’s (1985) naturalistic inquiry method was used to explore the student experiences.
In addition to qualitatively analyzing the goals and motivations of these specific cases, descriptive statistics of the student Intercultural Development Inventory (IDI) pre- and post-test questions and answers (Intercultural Communication Institute, 2003), taken in Spring 2006 and two years later in Spring 2008, were compared for the purpose of measuring changes in worldview orientations over time.  This provided the establishment of convergence or triangulation of quantitative and qualitative data.  Further exploration of preferred student learning styles by use of the Kolb Learning Style Inventory, v. 3.1 (Kolb, 1999) was initiated in order to analyze whether the study abroad program design matched the students’ learning style.  A study abroad preparatory model, Adapt, Adopt, Adept: A Preparatory Model for Study Abroad, is proposed that increases student active engagement abroad, thereby increasing the potential for accomplishing the stated goal of the University of Georgia (UGA) study abroad program, namely to develop “global citizens.”  Inquiry into these areas and the results obtained are directly relevant to study abroad program specialists, interested faculty, upper administrators in university policy making, and future students who might desire to participate in an international learning experience.
This particular study, in contrast to those discussed in the literature review, indicates a unique approach by focusing on the following:
•	one specific, experiential study abroad program;
•	using naturalistic inquiry as the method of obtaining such
        data;
•	using IDI scores to triangulate results of qualitative data;
•	incorporating information measured by the KLSI.
Both qualitative and quantitative data were collected.  Qualitative data were obtained via Blackboard, email, chat interviews via the internet, face to face interviews, and by means of journal entries.  By using naturalistic inquiry, the specific form of data provided and its content was left largely to the students to choose via the options listed above in order to best represent their voices.  Scores on the IDI provide the quantitative data used to assess qualitative findings.  The intention was that this study would provide an in-depth investigation of the students’ experiences in order to be used by individuals who find the information to be practical, functional, and helpful in improving the learning and cultural environment of study abroad students.",,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/8668",,,,"en",,,,,"University of Canterbury.

Many different approaches and initiatives have been used to raise boys’ achievement. Using Information Communication Technology (ICT) for education is just one of these strategies. A developing body of literature suggests that using ICT to teach in a blended format can raise student achievement and there is also evidence to suggest that boys appear to participate at a higher level when ICT is used in education.
An action research approach was used to investigate my online teaching practice. A team teaching approach was used for teaching this blended learning module. Sixteen boys were taught a unit of work in a blended format based on a physical education achievement standard. Students were taught six lessons face-to-face in a traditional classroom setting and six lessons online using self-directed study in a computer lab setting. This study used qualitative data collection methods supported with descriptive statistics to gain an understanding of online module participation and NCEA achievement. In order to encourage participation, a social constructivist theory underpinned the design of the online module. Participants involved in the study were taught a unit of work in a blended format and completed a pre-course questionnaire. Following analysis of participation and achievement at the end of the online module, five students were selected to participate in individual post-course interviews. The results of this study showed that achievement of boys taught in a blended format was higher than that of students taught solely face-to-face. Findings also indicated a strong relationship between online module participation and overall achievement. Conclusions from this study revealed that student characteristics, technical difficulties, specific online activities and the role of the teacher, were important factors for the success of the unit of work taught in a blended format. Recommendations from this study may be useful to inform and guide future blended learning units of work within the secondary education sector - particularly for boys' schools.",,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/8177",,,,"en",,,,,"University of Canterbury.

The research looked at the work of five teachers, including myself as a participant researcher. Through classroom observations and in depth conversations this research aimed to uncover how the teachers tried to meet the needs of their students on the AS and what affordances and/or constraints they encountered in their journeys. A social constructionist approach framed the research approach, together with a constructivist understanding of teaching and learning and these were used in conjunction with a philosophical activity theory base to explore mediators within the complex teaching and learning contexts.
 
The contrast between teachers viewing the AS as a disability or a difference was found to be important to the way the teachers constructed their student’s value in the class or their willingness to try and meet the student’s needs. This is in line with findings that teachers’ attitudes towards disability are a key factor in the inclusiveness of teaching (Macartney & Morton, 2011; Tait & Purdie, 2000). The role of support professionals in developing inclusive teaching was found to be complex, being both affording and/or constraining for the classroom teacher.
 
The complexity of teaching and the myriad of mediators (Lampert, 1985) involved in teaching students on the AS was analysed to uncover a number of key mediators. One of the key mediators was found to be teacher construction of the student on the AS as competent which was linked to the construction of teacher as competent (Morton, 2011). Key affordances to viewing the student on the AS as competent were the teacher having a belief in the value and worth of the student as a person and a learner and having an understanding of what it means to be a student on the AS. Teacher willingness to be student focused was found to be an important affording mediator, where there was a perceived conflict between student need and school or national policies.",,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/8190",,,,"en",,,,,"University of Canterbury.

Factors that will ultimately lead to the success of the New Zealand Government’s plan to introduce a national EHR system consistent with the Digital Health 2020 strategic plan are identifying what health professionals perceive as advantageous and disadvantageous in EHR use, designing an EHR with the perspectives of health professionals in mind, and involving the many health professions during EHR implementation processes. The objective of this study was to explore the perspectives of the Canterbury-based physiotherapists on the implementation and use of EHRs.

There is considerable research that demonstrates the effectiveness of the therapy’s main tenets; co-construction of client-led directions, amplification of positive change and instances of success (Nelson, Welsh, Trup, & Greenberg, 2011). Some research highlights the helpfulness of specific SFBT techniques such as miracle question (Jones-Smith, 2011), exceptions (Henson, 2015) and between session tasks (Jones-Smith, 2011). Most research, however, uses standard writing and talking as data. Less common is the inclusion of electronic platforms for conducting SFBT.

This research primarily focuses on between session tasks by exploring whether the use of text messages can support a client to complete such tasks. Four New Zealand co-educational high school students from Year 11 to Year 13 volunteered to attend four counselling sessions which were recorded on a Dictaphone and transcribed. At the end of each session the clients and the counsellor co-constructed text messages that the counsellor would send to them between sessions. Throughout the research, the text messages were examined to determine whether they supported SFBT principles and transcripts of participants’ feedback about the usefulness of the text messages were analysed thematically. The main findings were that using text messages fits very well with the intention of SFBT to promote client autonomy. Furthermore, co-construction of text messages enabled the counsellor to use appropriate client language when contacting the client between sessions. Both findings suggest the use of text messages when working with high school clients enables them to engage with counselling and focus on their own goals between sessions.

"18933","10092/806",,,"du Toit, Frederik C",,,,,,,,"2017",,,"Research has shown that parents make important contributions to their children’s
English literacy acquisition and that there are cultural differences in how parents
approach this task. Increased immigration has contributed to a diverse society in New
Zealand, with a quarter of the population foreign born, yet very little quantitative
research on New Zealand parents’ home literacy beliefs (PHLBs) is available.
Improving our understanding of PHLBs will assist teachers and other stakeholders to
support parents of young readers, especially parents who may not speak English as
their mother tongue. PHLBs have been characterized in past research as skill-based,
entertainment based or an approach which may include elements of both.

The aim of this study was to explore and develop our understanding of New Zealand
PHLBs. Participants in this study were 300 parents of children under the age of seven.
They were the parent in the family who spends the most time with their child to
promote their English literacy skills. An online questionnaire based on Anderson’s
(1995) Parents’ Perceptions of Literacy Learning Interview Schedule was used to
collect data. Demographic information and responses to 33 Likert-scale items related
to literacy acquisition were used in quantitative data analysis. Composite high scores
on the scale indicated that PHLBs aligned with an emergent approach to literacy
acquisition in which fun and entertainment considerations were central. Low scores
were congruent with a skills-based perspective in which parents preferred didactic
teaching techniques.

Nine independent variables were used in the analyses: parent level of education,
household income, parent gender and age, main home language, immigration status, how long the parent has been helping the child and the children’s gender and age.
Relations between the demographic variables and parents’ composite score were
analysed in a correlation matrix. The predictive capacity of the variables were
analysed in a hierarchical multiple regression. Analyses of variance were performed
to investigate group differences in terms of language and immigrant background on
measures derived from the questionnaire, including factors obtained from Factor
Analyses of the current data.

The most significant predictors of parents’ beliefs were their main home language
(L1), how long they have been helping their child and their immigration status, which
support the social nature of children’s literacy acquisition within the home
environment. Significant differences existed in the beliefs of parents who speak
English L1, including immigrants who speak English L1, and those who speak other
languages as L1. There were also significant differences in the beliefs of participants
who were born in New Zealand and immigrants, as well as between parents who have
been helping their children for short periods of time versus long timeframes.
Consistent with previous research, there was a large amount of variability in home
literacy beliefs across parents; however, in the two new factors established from the
current research, variance focused more on a ‘Parent-as-Teacher’ factor and there was
much less variance in a ‘Parent-as-Model’ factor. These new factors will be discussed
along with previous conceptualisations of parent/home literacy influences.",,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/15176",,,,"en","English",,,,"University of Canterbury",,,,,,,"http://library.canterbury.ac.nz/thesis/etheses_copyright.shtml","All Rights Reserved",,,,,,,,,,,,"Exploring the home literacy beliefs of parents with young children in New Zealand.",,,"Electronic Thesis or Dissertation",,,"Education","University of Canterbury",,"Doctoral",,,"Doctor of Philosophy",,,,,"College of Education, Health and Human Development, University of Canterbury",,"erikdutoit@hotmail.com",,,,,,,,,"Prof John Everatt"
"18928","10092/806",,,"London, Porsha Chantelle",,,,,,,,"2017",,,"This thesis sought to investigate and explore shifts in teacher practice when culturally diverse teachers (Māori and non-Māori) work towards becoming culturally responsive classroom managers. It is an inquiry into the impact of the Professional Learning and Development (PLD) on teachers‘ beliefs, values and classroom practices through the implementation of the pedagogical framework; Mana ki te Mana. This framework proposes that mana (authority with integrity) has the potential to be a significant motivational factor in the learning and teaching context. A fundamental principle of Mana ki te Mana is supporting teacher practice to become more inclusive, moving away from a functional/deficit view of behaviour to a sociocultural/agentic lens.

The study occurs in the context of a unique whole-school behaviour intervention and intensive professional learning and development. From 2014 to 2016, the Ministry of Education (MoE) in Aotearoa New Zealand (NZ) funded Huakina Mai (‗opening doorways‘), an Indigenous whole-school behaviour intervention pilot, in three primary schools in Aotearoa NZ. This initiative aims to improve teachers‘ culturally responsive classroom management (CRCM) and ultimately shift achievement outcomes for Māori students through targeted professional learning and systemic school change. This doctoral research presents the findings from the study of one particular element of the Huakina Mai pilot project: the impact of the PLD on teachers‘ classroom practices over the period of one year (2014–2015) of intensive PLD at three unique school settings.

This thesis reports the findings of three sets of data collection intervals from three schools in the South Island of Aotearoa NZ (Mānuka, Willow and Nikau) that participated in the study. Data was collected at three intervals over one year (Fullan, 2001). Case study and grounded theory methodologies were utilised in conjunction with kaupapa Māori Theory. Interviews and observations were carried out in 2014-2015. The interview questions prompted the participants to reflect on their personal and professional beliefs, values and classroom practices in relation to the pedagogical framework Mana ki te Mana. The findings make particular reference to self-reported changes in teacher practice demonstrated in teacher classroom management approaches and the use of language evidenced in qualitative teacher interviews and observation data.

Overall, the findings indicate that all of the participants experienced some improvements in their CRCM practices and gained new knowledge through Mana ki te Mana. Some participants reported transformational shifts in their practice, and these were linked to contextual differences between the case study sites. Rapid changes occurred when teachers‘ practice was deprivatised and when communities of learning emerged and acted as platforms for teachers to try out new practices in a supported context. Supported settings allowed for critical conversations and dialogues within culturally safe environments and mutually caring relationships to form and grow. Relationships between staff members emerged as being integral to managing the change process, reducing stress, increasing mentoring and leadership and in building confidence as teachers addressed unconscious and often confronting practices. The organisation leadership of the school context was vital in supporting practitioners to participate in continuous learning throughout the professional learning and development. These contexts created strong leadership direction through the Māori strategic priorities, shared vision, goals and organisational practices that embodied a collective responsibility for te ao Māori worldview learning and whole school change.

This study highlighted that shifts in teachers CRCM practices occur when there are close links between the theory and practice. That is, when teachers have strategies, resources, mentoring/coaching, and access to literature to support them to implement new approaches while becoming critically reflective and aware of their own changes in their thinking, theorising and practice. In particular, the findings indicate that four key constructs emerge as part of the change process. These constructs provide the foundation for the emerging practice based framework that proposes that changes in classroom management (moving from Applied Behaviour Analysis (ABA) and other Behaviour Management (BM) approaches to Māori relationship- based approaches) does not happen in isolation from key ontological (shifts in the critical beliefs that shape individuals sense of unique identity), epistemological and pedagogical processes within principal frameworks that govern teaching and learning practice.",,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/15171",,,,"en","English",,,,"University of Canterbury",,,,,,,"http://library.canterbury.ac.nz/thesis/etheses_copyright.shtml","All Rights Reserved",,,,,,,,,,,,"Incorporating indigenous values into teacher professional learning and development for culturally responsive classroom management.",,,"Electronic Thesis or Dissertation",,,"Education","University of Canterbury",,"Doctoral",,,"Doctor of Philosophy",,,,,"College of Education, Health and Human Development, University of Canterbury",,"Porsha.london@tetapuae.co.nz",,,,,,,,,"Associate Professor Sonja Macfarlane"

It examines the government’s policy for ICT in education and the context in which it needs to be translated into practice. That context includes the development of successive policies and curriculum plans, the aspirational goals for ICT in education, the international literature about ICT that influences policy, the education system of Nepal, the varying ways teachers are appointed and trained, the role of NGOs in providing infrastructures and training, characteristics and resources of the rural context and the resources within rural schools and communities. It also includes the impact of the devastating 2015 earthquake on rural life generally, and on schools’ capacity to teach with ICT in particular.

Central to the study are the experiences and perceptions of sixteen rural primary teachers from five schools across Nepal. The study foregrounds their practices of using ICT and their understanding of the uses of ICT. It also examines their experiences of training to use ICT, the resources they have available and how they use them, and the impact of the earthquake on their lives and work. In addition, it reports their reflections about the wider aspects of educational development, appointment of teachers and teacher training.

The study investigates the development of Nepal’s ICT education policy and its connection with international ICT development. It examines how the Government of Nepal works to integrate ICT in education and the potential risks that are involved in the current strategy. It also reports a great gap between Nepal’s current practices of ICT in rural primary schools and western development of ICT in educational practices.

The present study used an experimental design to investigate whether a basic facts fluency programme, implemented within a self-regulated learner (SRL) framework, could lead to increased fluency with multiplication facts for Year 5 and Year 6 New Zealand students (9-10 years old). It also investigated the extent to which the SRL programme altered students’ basic facts practice behaviour outside of school hours. The study found that the SRL programme resulted in rapid fluency development that was maintained over time. Nomothetic and idiographic analysis confirmed that the programme was suitable for use within tier one of the response to intervention framework. In addition, the study also found that students who received the programme altered their practice behaviour outside of school hours.

"9552","10092/806",,,,"Gosteva, Aleksandra Vladimirovna",,,,,,,"2013",,,"The growing number of young children exhibiting conduct problems is a cause of serious concern for many early childhood teachers. Past research has shown that child centred play therapy (CCPT) may be effective for addressing conduct problems. However, little research has
been carried out to study the impact of CCPT on children exhibiting these problems, through training early childhood teachers in using CCPT strategies. Therefore, the goal of this pilot study was to explore whether young children who have persistent conduct problems in early childhood settings in New Zealand would show improved behaviour following their early childhood teachers learning some play-therapy strategies. It also aimed to gather information from teachers
about the suitability of play therapy strategies within the context of the New Zealand early
childhood system.
Two early childhood teachers and two children, aged 4 years participated in the study. Following
the teachers’ training, a decrease in problem behaviour and a notable increase in positive play
behaviour were observed for the two child-participants. These positive changes corresponded
with the improved Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) (Goodman, 1997) scores as
measured by the teachers. The Total Difficulties scores gained for both children were in the
clinical range at the beginning of the study and had improved to the normal range at the followup.
The results also showed that the teachers appeared to have benefited from the training and
were very satisfied with the intervention outcomes. They found the training acceptable and
intended to continue using play therapy strategies in their centre.
The findings of the current study extend previous research by demonstrating the teachers’ ability to deliver CCPT strategies. Some limitations of the current study included the limited number of observations during baseline, utilising teachers involved in the CCPT training as the source of
data on children, and the absence of the parent report measures.

"9240","10092/806",,,"Wise, Stuart Leslie",,,,,,,,"2013",,,"This thesis examines how nine teachers in four New Zealand secondary schools are using digital technology in music education in order to gain a greater understanding of how it is used, why it is used and what constraints may exist that hinder implementation. This thesis contends that although there was evidence of considerable use of digital technology in the schools, particularly in composition activities, a range of factors are influencing the choices teachers are making as to how they are using it. Despite the potential digital technology may have to transform classroom activities in music education, usage, in most cases, remains fundamentally conservative and heavily informed by traditional Western art music practices.

A multi-site case study approach guided this investigation. Initial descriptive numerical data were gathered from teacher and student questionnaires. Further data came from the semi-structured interviews with teachers and small groups of students in each of the four cases. Findings from the data showed that although the teachers participating in the study had a range of digital technology available to them and they made use of it on a regular basis, a range of factors influenced the choices they made when using it in their classrooms. 

Amongst this range of factors influencing the choices they made, the most important appeared to be the requirements of an external examination system that is remains informed by Western art music practices and in particular on the cognitive dimensions of analysis, harmony, music history, traditional aural skills and an understanding of music notation and theory.  Even though there are specific references to a range of styles and genres in the mandated national curriculum, Western art music practices remain most important to most of the teachers.

Findings from the student data showed that the students participating in this study appeared to have a high level of digital literacy and were able to use digital technology in both formal and informal learning situations. A number of the students also discussed and demonstrated their informal music learning skills in performance and composition activities. For these students, contemporary music practices are very important to them and if they do not receive the information they need at school they know how to access it using a range of digital devices in an informal learning environment.  This thesis contends that to be a successful music educator in the 21st century, the ability to work with Western art music practices and contemporary music practices is becoming an increasingly important skill.",,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/8485",,,,"en",,,,,"University of Canterbury.

"8836","10092/806",,,"Mohamed, Niuma",,,,,,,,"2013",,,"Assessment practice in Maldivian schools is undergoing change. The newly developed draft of Maldivian National Curriculum with associated documents aligns assessment, instruction, and curriculum to provide optimum learning conditions for students. The Maldivian Ministry of Education (MOE), in collaboration with UNICEF, has introduced quality indicators for the Child Friendly Baraabaru School (CFBS) based on the Maldivian National Curriculum. These indicators stress the importance of maintaining a balance between assessment for learning (formative assessment) and assessment of learning (summative assessment). The dissemination and implementation of best practices in formative assessment are currently underway in Maldivian schools. 
This study portrays a “snapshot in time” of assessment practices of three teachers and utilizes the findings to provide an insight into the MOE’s initiative of assessment innovations in Maldivian classrooms and schools. The study found that the three teachers have to practice formative assessment within high quality interactions based on thoughtful questions, attend to responses, and with observation and documentation to reflect a valid picture of the whole child. 
Nevertheless, the study also showed how the three teachers separated assessment from teaching and learning as well as how the teachers documented and reported this assessment data. There is a strong element of competition for academic achievement, as reported in grades and numerical scores. The competition is amongst students, teachers and parents. This competition appears to get in the way of assessment being used to support teaching and learning. 
Nonetheless, when the research data was explored through a formative assessment lens, there was also evidence of formative assessment being used in the normal day-to-day happenings in the three classrooms. The teachers in this study were not always confident in their use of formative assessment, and did not necessarily recognize when they were using formative assessment strategies. They all wanted all of their students to be successful learners, and they wanted to be good teachers. The study shows some of the complexities that teachers face when implementing new approaches to assessment.",,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/8686",,,,"en",,,,,"University of Canterbury.

Ken Blanchard (2003)

Background: Student leadership in schools is traditionally modelled on an outdated ideology of
leadership. The traditional model consists of a group of selected prefects, who are given
leadership responsibility, allowed privileges, and are tasked with representing the student body.
Contemporary views of leadership are relationship based, collaborative and distributed rather
than hierarchical. Purpose: This research focuses on the experiences of designated student
leaders and non-designated students. It explores the benefits, the challenges, and the degree
to which the student’s value school leadership experience. Methodology: Through interviews
and observations, past students, current students, and staff at a case study school share their
experiences and opinions about student leadership. The data is presented in two ways; using
common themes and as three composite narratives. These stories give insight into the lives of
the students through their eyes. Findings / Conclusion: The data shows that student
leadership is an empowering and valuable educational experience, one which should be
available to all senior students. The school’s approach to student leadership; through its
ideology, structure, and support, dictates its effectiveness. Implications: A model for student
leadership, based on the findings of the research, is presented. The model is structured around
an ideology that views student leadership as a supported learning opportunity for all senior
students who choose to be involved.",,,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/15271",,,"en","English",,,,"University of Canterbury",,,,,,,"http://library.canterbury.ac.nz/thesis/etheses_copyright.shtml","All Rights Reserved",,,,,,,,,,,,"Leadership for all : an investigation into the benefits of student leadership in secondary schools",,,"Electronic Thesis or Dissertation",,"Education",,"University of Canterbury",,"Masters",,,"Master of Education",,"2644742",,,"College of Education, Health and Human Development, University of Canterbury",,".",,,,,,,,,"Associate Professor Billy O'Steen"
"9428","10092/806",,,"Comarmond, Odile Andrine Louise de",,,,,,,,"2013",,,"This thesis reports on an investigation into teacher commitment in secondary schools in Seychelles. The overarching aim was to gain an insight into the experiences and perceptions of teacher commitment in order to get a better understanding of teachers’ career trajectories and issues relating to teacher retention. Another aim was to explore the experiences and perceptions of the participating teachers, headteachers and policymakers on the factors that influence commitment and trajectories of secondary teachers at the different stages of their teaching careers. 

In order to achieve these aims a qualitative methodology was chosen with a combination of three different approaches: phenomenography, phenomenology and multiple case studies. The use of multiple-approaches was considered appropriate in order to enhance the results of the investigation of such a complex phenomenon like teacher commitment. The case studies focused on four teacher groups representing newly qualified teachers, mid-career teachers, experienced teachers and teachers who had left the profession. Data were sought from different participant groups in relation to teacher commitment, experiences and career trajectories. The exploration involved semi-structured interviews with secondary teachers, headteachers and policymakers.

The findings show that participants describe teacher commitment in relation to altruism, personal qualities, pedagogical content knowledge and connectedness. The ideas of what constitutes a committed teacher for these participants reveal complexity in the phenomenon of teacher commitment. Personal, organisational and contextual factors are found to influence these participants’ understandings. The findings identify a complex interplay of personal and contextual spheres of influence on teacher commitment. 

Another level of complexity that the findings revealed relate to the interconnection between teacher commitment, teachers’ career stages and retention. The commitment of beginning teachers is found to be more at risk than that of mid-career and experienced teachers. Education stakeholders hold different views to those of teachers on the factors that impact on teacher commitment and retention. 

The study concludes by proposing a conceptual model for teacher commitment that illustrates its complex nature. Teacher commitment is multifaceted and the nature and level of commitment held by teachers involves the constant negotiation between these different factors. 

The findings of the study contribute to a nuanced understanding of teacher commitment and have the potential to generate more in-depth and extensive studies of this phenomenon. These findings may inform policymakers both in Seychelles and in other national and international contexts about issues relating to teacher recruitment, development and retention, which are worldwide concerns.",,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/8679",,,,"en",,,,,"University of Canterbury.

"9508","10092/806",,,"Teschers, Christoph",,,,,,,,"2013",,,"Today’s societies are characterised by a host of opportunities and challenges. The pace of life is quicker than ever before, and the changes and developments in societies, science and technology come about faster every day. One of the major challenges for human beings is to make a myriad of choices on a daily basis, which will define their place in society, in life and in the world altogether. To make prudent and sensible decisions is, therefore, one of the key competencies for a successful and good life. 

This study revisits the idea of an education focused on the personal development and well-being of human beings instead of economic growth. Drawing on philosophical ideas about the good life -- especially Schmid’s art of living concept Lebenskunst -- and recent research in positive psychology, an argument is made for a shift of focus in education and schooling towards a good life and an art of living for today's students. Possible implications of this change of focus for educational practice are discussed, including suggestions for curricula and school subjects, the structure of schools and learning environments, teaching methods, and teacher training.

The original contributions to knowledge in this study are: a critique of Schmid's concept from an educational point of view; a comparison of positive psychology research and philosophical concepts of the art of living with a focus on Schmid's work; the development of an educational approach to the art of living, including a discussion of schooling in relation to the art of living; and consequent first steps towards the development of an education for life concept.",,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/8688",,,,"en",,,,,"University of Canterbury.

"19007","10092/806",,,"King, Berenice Evelyn",,,,,,,,"1969",,,"In 1967 there were approximately 4,300 young women in New Zealand undertaking the three year course leading to State registration as a nurse. On the basis of past and current records it could be assumed that at least one in every five of those student nurses would withdraw from the programme before qualifying. The reasons given for withdrawal could be divided into two broad categories. The first, those reasons which account for a proportion of the loss from any predominantly female occupation, marriage, ill-health or a change in personal or family circumstances. The second were those which bore a direct relationship to the career choice; for nurses these were 'dislike of nursing' and 'study problems'


It was the purpose of this study to determine, if possible, what constituted 'dislike of nursing'; what factors differentiated the student who withdrew from the programme because of 'study problems' from her successful colleague and whether or not there was a demonstrable relationship between the individual's reaction to nursing and her level of achievement. The term success in this context ref erred solely to the student nurse who progressed satisfactorily in the nursing programme. No attempt was made to assess the quality of care given and there was only a passing reference to the amount of satisfaction derived by the individual from her nursing role.


Withdrawal was a post-recruitment problem. Factual information about the reasons given for and the stage of training reached when resignation occurred was available from the annual returns submitted by the matrons of all training schools; the level of general education attained by student nurses was also recorded at national level. Such objective data was important but it did not provide the background information on the individual who had elected to nurse. Why and when the decision to nurse was made and the source and type of information available on nursing were two areas of interest to those concerned with recruitment programmes. Those concerned with the planning of nursing education for the present and future had a need to know more about the nature and extent of the general education of actual and potential student nurses.


Finally, investigation into the question of withdrawal was prompted in part by the statistical evidence that the rate of withdrawal was high and in part from personal experience with students who had been disappointed in their expectations of nursing, of themselves or of both.",,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/15372",,,,"en","English",,,,"University of Canterbury",,,,,,,"http://library.canterbury.ac.nz/thesis/etheses_copyright.shtml","All Rights Reserved",,,,,,,,,,,,"A study of the selection, achievement and loss of student nurses from one school of nursing in New Zealand",,,"Electronic Thesis or Dissertation",,,"Education","University of Canterbury",,"Masters",,,"Master of Arts",,,"385061",,"College of Education, Health and Human Development, University of Canterbury",,"ucresearchrepository@canterbury.ac.nz",,,,,,,,,

Using semi-structured interviews, information is collected about the lives and experiences of the boys and some of their parents and teachers. When their narratives are analysed, three themes emerge: expectations; barriers; and navigation. 

During the thesis process my focus shifts to include reflections from my own life history to provide additional insight. This leads to the discovering and adding of voices, all different but all mine: The Pacific Islander, The Academic, and The Obedient Puppet. Within and alongside these voices, the revealed presence of hegemony, cultural capital, and deficit theorising make themselves felt. Collectively, all elements contribute to understanding the boys’ journey through high school.

The findings suggest that the parents of boys currently at school possess or are gaining insights into the workings of education. As a result, they are more able to assist their children than those of my generation. Alongside this new parental knowledge the boys are also making changes in how they navigate and utilise strategies through high school. The school itself is making fewer changes than either the parents or the boys, and the changes that are taking place are dependant on the presence or absence of initiatives by innovative teachers.",,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/5523",,,,"en",,,,,"University of Canterbury.

"9408","10092/806",,,"Fryer, Simon",,,,,,,,"2013",,,"Rock climbing is a multi-dimensional sport encompassing physiological, psychological, bio-mechanical and skill components. Interpretation of data in current investigations is limited by the lack of knowledge regarding the extent of the potential interaction of pre-climb anxieties with the physiological responses during an ascent. This thesis attempts to delineate the psychological and physiological contributions of on-sight top rope and lead climbing in multiple ability groups of rock climbers. Furthermore, the thesis goes on to gain an understanding of the de-oxygenation and re-oxygenation profiles in two forearm flexors during sustained and intermittent contractions-to-failure, as well as during the subsequent recovery period.

In study one, intermediate, advanced and elite rock climbers were asked to on-sight a route at the top of their respective best self-reported on-sight grade. There were no ability group or ascent style differences for any pre-climb measures of anxiety. However, elite rock climbers had significantly higher oxygen consumption, heart rate (HR) and cortisol (physiological component) responses compared to lower ability groups. Furthermore, the elite climbers spent a significantly greater percentage of their static time resting during the ascent compared to all lower ability groups. As there appears to be no differences in the anxiety based interaction with the physiological response, study one suggests that ability group and ascent style differences may be attributed mainly to the changes in the physical demands of the route. Furthermore, it would appear the higher level rock climbers may have a greater reliance on the aerobic metabolism during an on-sight ascent. 

Study two investigated the haemodynamic responses to sustained and intermittent handgrip contractions which are seen during rock climbing ascents. Intermediate, advanced and elite climbers as well as a control group were asked to perform sustained and intermittent contractions (10s) at 40% of maximal volitional capacity until exhaustion. Oxygen saturation, blood flow (BF) and HR were measured pre, during and post contractions. Elite and advanced climbers were able to de-oxygenate both the flexor digitorum profundus and the flexor carpi radialis significantly more than the intermediate climbers, and the control group. During the intermittent test to failure, relative re-oxygenation during the rest period (3s) (re-oxygenation which takes into account the amount of de-oxygenation during the previous contraction), may be an important determinant of the force time integral. During the intermittent test, the increase in Δ BF, release HR and Δ HR during the rest periods suggest that vessel occlusion in elite and advanced rock climbers may not be as prominant as previously speculated upon. Furthermore, elite rock climbers appear to have a significantly faster time to half recovery after both sustained and intermittent contractions-to-failure. 

In conclusion, it would appear that the psychological responses assessed pre on-sight rock climbing may not be different between ability groups or ascent styles. Instead, ability group differences may be due to physiological adaptations caused in part by the significantly greater amount of training. Furthermore, elite rock climbers appear to be able to de-oxygenate and re-oxygenate faster and to a greater extent than lower ability level climbers due to an increased Δ BF and Δ HR during intermittent rest periods, as well as post-exercise. Further investigation focusing on aerobic/anaerobic contribution, determination of capillary density and muscle fiber type would aid in gaining a greater understanding of rock climbing performance.",,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/8704",,,,"en",,,,,"University of Canterbury.

"9799","10092/806",,,"Williams, Judith Airini",,,,,,,,"2013",,,"I investigated the problem of why some students do not implement the feedback they are given, when the feedback they receive is formulated in accordance with what we know about best practice in the giving of feedback. I was interested in exploring the factors which may influence students as they do or do not take some form of action to ‘close the gap’ between the standard they have attained and the standard they need to reach. I worked with seven Year 8 boys who were enrolled at an intermediate school in the South Island of New Zealand. The study is qualitative because the methodologies associated with that paradigm are more likely to provide insights into the problem, situated as it is in the experience of students in a classroom setting. 

I used phenomenography to identify the qualitatively different ways in which the participants viewed the importance and helpfulness of feedback as well as identifying the factors which influenced their acceptance or rejection of the feedback received from their classroom teacher. The categories I identified included supporting progress towards short- and long-term learning goals; the effect of feedback on personal attitudes towards learning; the relationship between the student and the teacher; the type and timing of feedback; the perceived ownership of the work to which the feedback related; and the conditions and understandings of the student. I discussed each of these and formed a phenomenographic outcome space for each of the three basic areas of importance, helpfulness, and factors affecting response. I then used a case approach to prepare case reports on two of the participants, in order to show how the categories identified through the phenomenographic analysis might be manifested in individuals as well as to allow the voices of the students to be heard. I found that each individual embodies a unique combination of the categories, and that it is this unique profile which affects his or her reception and subsequent use of feedback. 

I then combined the three phenomenographic outcome spaces to form a model of feedback, arranged in four levels, which may be of interest to classroom teachers as they endeavour to improve the learning outcome of the students through tailoring the feedback they give to them. I illustrated the potential use of the model by mapping onto it the profile of the two boys included in the case reports. The differences in, and similarities of, responses of the two boys to feedback are easily discerned. I discussed how these similarities and differences may offer some explanation for differing responses to feedback. To a certain extent the boys have similar outlooks, and may respond in similar ways to feedback which matches with these outlooks. However, at a deeper level, their differences are marked. Feedback which matches the preferences of one is not likely to match those of the other. I argue that in such a case one may accept and act on the feedback while the other may not.    

I have identified some areas for further research and development which could build on these findings. These include the need to explore the views of girls and other groups of boys on this subject, together with undertaking a project which allows the academic progress of individuals to be tracked once their preferences were identified and mapped onto the model. It would also be useful to construct a suitable instrument for classroom teachers to use for mapping the preferences of their own class members, and to identify any differences in the modifications to their feedback processes which teachers may make to their classroom practice following their use of such an instrument.",,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/8991",,,,"en",,,,,"University of Canterbury.

"8065","10092/806",,,"Osman, Mohamud",,,,,,,,"2012",,,"For the people of Christchurch and its wider environs of Canterbury in New Zealand, the 4th of September 2010 earthquake and the subsequent aftershocks were daunting. To then experience a more deadly earthquake five months later on the 22nd of February 2011 was, for the majority, overwhelming. A total of 185 people were killed and the earthquake and continuing aftershocks caused widespread damage to properties, especially in the central city and eastern suburbs. A growing body of literature consistently documents the negative impact of experiencing natural disasters on existing psychological disorders. As well, several studies have identified positive coping strategies which can be used in response to adversities, including reliance on spiritual and cultural beliefs as well as developing resilience and social support. The lifetime prevalence of severe mental health disorders such as posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) occurring as a result of experiencing natural disasters in the general population is low. However, members of refugee communities who were among those affected by these earthquakes, as well as having a past history of experiencing traumatic events, were likely to have an increased vulnerability.

The current study was undertaken to investigate the relevance to Canterbury refugee communities of the recent Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Authority (CERA) draft recovery strategy for Christchurch post-earthquakes. This was accomplished by interviewing key informants who worked closely with refugee communities. These participants were drawn from different agencies in Christchurch including Refugee Resettlement Services, the Canterbury Refugee Council, CERA, and health promotion and primary healthcare organisations, in order to obtain the views of people who have comprehensive knowledge of refugee communities as well as expertise in local mainstream services.

The findings from the semi-structured interviews were analysed using qualitative thematic analysis to identify common themes raised by the participants. The key informants described CERA’s draft recovery strategy as a significant document which highlighted the key aspects of recovery post disaster. Many key informants identified concerns regarding the practicality of the draft recovery strategy. For the refugee communities, some of those concerns included the short consultation period for the implementation phase of the draft recovery strategy, and issues surrounding communication and collaboration between refugee agencies involved in the recovery.

This study draws attention to the importance of communication and collaboration during recovery, especially in the social reconstruction phase following a disaster, for all citizens but most especially for refugee communities.",,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/7474",,,,"en",,,,,"University of Canterbury.

"10039","10092/806",,,"Tapper, Catherine Louise",,,,,,,,"2014",,,"This thesis explores the experiences of school for gifted and talented adolescents in New Zealand. The foci of inquiry are a) what it is like to be gifted and talented in a New Zealand schooling context, and b) the understandings of a group of students, their parents and teachers, about the achievement and underachievement of gifted learners. The research relates specifically to a group of 11 gifted and talented students, their experiences and ideas about what it means to be gifted and talented and to achieve as gifted and talented learners.
Adopting a qualitative, phenomenological methodology, the voices of the students were prioritised in the research process and thesis writing. Semi-structured interviews are the main source of data. Multiple interviews were conducted with the adolescent participants over a period of 18 months, within their first two years of secondary schooling, and with their parents and teachers. Written reflections by the students provide supplementary data. 
The thesis explores and problematises understandings of achievement and underachievement that are presented in literature and were held by the research participants. The implications of these understandings on the decisions that gifted adolescents make, about what constitutes achievement and whether and how they seek to achieve in school, are highlighted.
The essences of the lived schooling experiences for the gifted and talented adolescents in this study are drawn together and summarised in three main themes. The first theme relates to culture and context and how this influenced the students’ understandings about what it meant to be gifted and talented within the particular socio-cultural milieu of a New Zealand school. The participants showed an understanding of the preferred New Zealand values of modesty and the downplaying of any perceived advantages. The second theme relates to the concept of ‘potential’ as an enigma and a nebulous term that is assumed to mean different and particular things for gifted and talented learners. It is argued that it is not theoretically sound to structure definitions of underachievement for gifted learners around the idea of ‘not reaching your potential.’ The third theme relates to the negotiation of adolescent identities. Being gifted and talented added to the complexities around identity development for the students who participated in the study, as they worked to find their fit within the socio-cultural context of a New Zealand school. Four different identity profiles are developed to provide an illustration of the variation and complexity of gifted and talented students’ identity negotiations.
There is little research literature that centres on the lived experiences of gifted students within New Zealand society. This study seeks to address this gap. The research and theorising from this thesis will add to the growing research base in New Zealand on educating gifted and talented learners. Readers of the thesis, who may include a range of education professionals, are invited to draw implications from the study about the experiences and achievement of gifted adolescents and relate the findings to their knowledge and understanding of gifted and talented learners, within their own work situations and cultural contexts.",,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/9057",,,,"en",,,,,"University of Canterbury.

"9930","10092/806",,,"Brinson, David Raymond",,,,,,,,"2014",,,"Populations in developed and developing countries are becoming increasingly sedentary and the adverse health effects of relatively sedentary lifestyles, the so called lifestyle diseases, are now obvious. However, moderately vigorous physical activity is positively linked via a cause-and-effect relationship with a range of improved health outcomes. Broadly, current physical activity recommendations suggest that adults should achieve a total of at least 30 minutes a day of at least moderate intensity physical activity on five or more days of the week; however, estimates suggest that the majority of adults in the Western World do not meet these recommendations. Many of the factors involved in the initiation and long-term maintenance of physical activity are not fully understood. Considering the rapid pace of technological development and the general move away from labour-based economies, it does appear that the required level of physical activity necessary for optimal health needs to come from leisure-time activity– specifically, planned, regular, moderately vigorous exercise and/or sport. Unfortunately, many people experience great difficulty in engaging with and maintaining a physically active lifestyle and typically there is a rather large gap between what people know to be healthy and what they actually do. 
The general aim of this project was to design, implement and evaluate the clinical, social and behavioural effectiveness of a buddy-Motivational Interviewing intervention (buddy-MI) in assisting relatively sedentary adults to adopt and maintain regular physical activity for the purpose of improving their cardio-respiratory fitness, health, and quality of life. Specific aims of the intervention included formally involving social support (via the self-selected motivational-buddy) and strengthening individuals’ motivation for and movement toward their physical activity goals. The experimental intervention specifically aimed to extend the MI treatment effect by enhancing participants’ commitment to physical activity over time via intra-treatment social support (support provided within treatment sessions) as well as extra-treatment social support (day-to-day support) provided by the motivational-buddy. A fundamental was to deliver the intervention in a format that could realistically be implemented within typical primary care settings, workplaces, schools or other similar setting: to work towards healthier more active communities and to potentially reduce health system resource utilisation. 
Using a repeated-measures pragmatic parallel group randomised controlled trial (RCT) design, relatively sedentary adolescents and adults, in stable health, recruited from a university campus population were allocated to one of two interventions. In the experimental intervention, participants were supported by a self-selected motivational-buddy and they received 2-4 sessions of buddy-MI over a period of 12-months (participant determined schedule) as well as pro-active follow-up emails. The control intervention was standard care MI, and the same email follow-up as in the experimental group but without the additional support of a motivational-buddy. The main outcomes were self-reported physical activity, cardio-respiratory fitness and health related quality of life. These primary outcomes were measured at four time-points over the 12-months intervention and follow-up period and quantitative methods were used to analyse the data. Qualitative data were also analysed and presented in relation to the motivational-buddy component of the intervention.  The study evaluated the feasibility and incremental effectiveness of motivational-buddy support compared to one-on-one MI in people who had expressed an interest in becoming more physically active. It used a novel intervention design incorporating self-selected motivational-buddies in an effort to mitigate the twin problems of poor adherence and behavioural regression that are commonly associated with physical activity promotion programmes. The intervention was found to have merit and the potential implications for the health-care system, and the wider community, are discussed.",,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/8922",,,,"en",,,,,"University of Canterbury.

However, for some children, their challenging behaviour is persistent, unresponsive to environmental supports and occurs across contexts. Without intervention, young children with challenging behaviour are at an increased risk of detrimental long-term social-emotional and behavioural outcomes such as academic difficulties, poor interpersonal relationships, substance abuse, delinquency, and mental health difficulties. The aim of this project was to investigate the effectiveness of universal home practices and the Prevent-Teach-Reinforce for families (PTR-F) intervention in teaching prosocial social-emotional competence and decreasing persistent challenging behaviour in a New Zealand home setting. The second aim was to investigate the applicability of PTR-F to the New Zealand setting. Using PTR-F procedures, individual families worked collaboratively with the author to assess then implement universal home practices before designing and implementing a function-based individualised behaviour intervention plan. The project used a single-case multi-intervention design across three participants to examine changes in identified targeted challenging behaviour and desirable behaviour across baseline, universal practices, intervention 1 and 2 and follow-up phases. Results indicated that implementing universal home practices alone were not effective but when the function-based individualised PTR-F behaviour plan was implemented positive behaviour change occurred for all three children with reductions in challenging behaviour and increases in desirable behaviour. However there was variability across participants in the extent of the behaviour change. Overall findings also demonstrated that PTR-F is an appropriate behavioural family intervention that is applicable to the New Zealand setting. The overall challenges associated with implementing the PTR-F intervention and the implications of these finds for practice are discussed.",,,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/15435",,,"en","English",,,,"University of Canterbury",,,,,,,"http://library.canterbury.ac.nz/thesis/etheses_copyright.shtml","All Rights Reserved",,,,,,,,,,,,"The effects of the prevent-teach-reinforce for families (PTR-F) intervention with three young children.",,,"Electronic Thesis or Dissertation",,"Health Sciences",,"University of Canterbury",,"Masters",,,"Master of Arts",,"2658689",,,"College of Education, Health and Human Development, University of Canterbury",,"Helen_shadbolt@hotmail.com",,,,,,,,,"Dr Laurie McLay"

People with PSA experience an increase in Heart Rate (HR), negative self- focused thoughts and observable behaviours such as, trembling or non-fluent speech. In this study Video Self-Modelling (VSM), an intervention based on observational learning, was used to increase performance fluency and decrease cognitive, behavioural, and physiological anxiety. Ten high school students with high PSA participated from an English class in a New Zealand school. Video self-models were created for each student through editing to depict confident speaking and then viewed by the students 5 to 8 times over a fortnight. Results indicated from pre-intervention to post-intervention that all students decreased their level of behavioural anxiety. Seven of the ten students decreased their level of self-reported speech anxiety and six students self-reported more positive thoughts about public speaking. There was a decrease in HR for two of the four students, who wore HR monitors during the study.

Without effective intervention, the child's nocturnal enuresis may persist. This may result in possible distress and even psychological problems in the child. The current study had two aims. The first aim was to examine the effectiveness of retention control training, and the urine alarm if necessary, as an intervention for primary nocturnal enuresis. The second aim was to explore children's attributions for the therapeutic outcome of the intervention method regarding their nocturnal enuresis. The first aim was important, as previous research has revealed contradictory findings. The second aim was also important, as to date, research has neglected to explore this topic. Six children aged 8 to 12 years and their primary caregivers participated in the current study. Attribution data was obtained at three intervals through one-on-one semi-structured interviews between the researcher and child. Results found that with retention control training: one child achieved nocturnal urinary continence, three children decreased the number of their wet nights, and two children failed to respond. The addition of the urine alarm enabled three more children to achieve nocturnal urinary continence. In terms of attributions, results found that brief psycho-education appeared to have influenced these children‟s attributions. However, overall attribution findings suggested that children perceived researcher assistance, unknown factors, and the techniques used in retention control training to have influenced their success in the achievement of nocturnal urinary continence.

"9605","10092/806",,,"Grueber, Arno",,,,,,,,"2013",,,"Objectives: Evidence suggests that physical activity reduces symptoms of clinical anxiety and depression, however, very little research has been published about service user’s experiences with physical activity interventions. The ABE Programme is a client-centred, individualised physical activity intervention for people with mental illness delivered by non-government organisation Richmond Services Limited. The objectives of this study were to investigate service users’ outcomes, experiences, barriers to physical activity and contributing factors for physical activity adherence, to make recommendations for health policy, community development, service improvements and further research. 
Methods: An explanatory concurrent mixed methods design was applied: for the quantitative component a simple quasi-experimental reversal study to analyse participants’ physical (blood pressure, body weight), mental (self-esteem, mental well-being) measures, physical activity level and smoking status; for the qualitative component a descriptive study conducting semi-structured interviews with participants of the programme. 
Results: Thirty assessment results were available for the quantitative data analysis. Self-esteem, mental well-being and physical activity levels showed significant improvements, whereas physical measurements and smoking status showed no changes. Thirteen interviews were conducted. Qualitative findings reinforced and enhanced quantitative results. Participants’ experiences were physical, psychological and social. Support was important to overcome barriers. Multiple factors contributed to maintaining physical activity. Clients made suggestions related to the support, structure and contents of the programme.
Conclusions: The ABE Programme contributes to the improvements of participants’ mental and physical well-being. Professional support is crucial. Improvements are recommended regarding follow-up support, group activities and evidence-based physical activity adherence methods. Emphasis for policy should be on early intervention, collaboration between services and physical activity promotion approaches on multiple levels. Further research is recommended, for example, to develop efficient and cost-effective physical activity adherence approaches. Future research could include single subject studies, surveys and focus groups studies within Richmond and across the wider mental health sector.",,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/9120",,,,"en",,,,,"University of Canterbury.

The study, adopted the pseudo-empirical research design with a pre-test structure, was carried out with 30 third year undergraduate students enrolled in a course of English for Information Technology 1 at a university in Thailand. The study modified an existing commercial game to better meet specific objectives of the language course. The data were collected by means of quantitative and qualitative research techniques (i.e., recordings of TL interaction in class and computer game activities, questionnaires, and interviews). The transcripts of participants’ interaction were analysed for the amount of words and turns and for the characteristics of their TL use. The questionnaire and interview responses were analysed to provide the evidence of participants’ WTC.

The study found that gameplay encouraged a significant increase in the quantity of TL interaction which also contained a variety of discourse functions associated with social, collaborative interaction (e.g., greetings, requests, and questions) and covered ranges of linguistic features (e.g., use of a variety of verb forms). This provided evidence that language learners received opportunities to interact using the TL when playing games. In addition, participants’ responses to WTC questionnaires and interview questions indicated that the level of WTC appeared to be enhanced by taking part in the game, as positive perceptions of WTC, low anxiety when interacting in the TL, high self-perceived communicative competence, and high frequency of TL use, were reported. This indicated that language learners benefited from less stressful environments within the game and thus were willing to use the opportunities provided to practice and use the TL. 

In light of these findings, this study draws attention to the role and effectiveness of computer games in encouraging TL use for authentic communication and willingness to use the language. The study offers some suggestions for future research and concludes with implications for second/foreign language pedagogy, curriculum and CALL material design, and educational game development.",,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/9227",,,,"en",,,,,"University of Canterbury.

"1379","10092/806",,,,,"Abbiss, J.",,,,,,"2005",,,"This thesis explores students' experiences of specialist information technology (IT) courses at the secondary school level in New Zealand. It asks whether students experience a gendered curriculum culture in relation to specialist IT subjects. The exploration involves a survey of national curriculum arrangements and detailed consideration of the manner in which the curriculum is implemented in practice by teachers and experienced by students in three case study classes in a conventional high school, Kahikatea High School (KHS). These classes are year 12 computer studies (CPS) and years 12 and 10 text and information management (TIM). Twenty-two students were the focus of detailed observation in the course of a year. It is found that students experience a gendered IT curriculum culture at KHS, which takes form in both gendered subject and classroom cultures. Gendered subject cultures are established in part through national curriculum structures that maintain subjects from historically gendered domains. Conservative local subject arrangements at KHS contribute to a gendered curriculum in practice. The curriculum takes on a gendered character as a function of choice - teachers' choices about subjects they will offer and the way courses are organised and presented, and students' choices about what subjects they will take. Particular subjects and courses are associated with nominally masculine and feminine computer practices and are thereby imbued with masculine and feminine subject identities. There is considerable variation and nuance in the way students experience different IT courses and in the meanings they make of their experiences. In short, individual students experience the same course differently. They are influenced to greater and lesser degrees by a range of factors, including expectations, prior experience, classroom pedagogy, classroom relationships and performance. Also, individual students are negotiating their masculine and feminine identities as students of IT and computer users as they participate in specialist IT courses and in other arenas of their lives. As they negotiate their roles as computer users and students of IT at KHS, males and females are established in relations of power or authority with the technology and with each other - as computer controllers, aspirant controllers and competent users. These relationships have a gendered character that derives from the attribution of the status of controllers to (some) males and the exclusion of females from this group. However, individual males and females aspire to and are attributed the characteristics and status commensurate with a range of user roles. Gender is a factor in individual students' experiences, but in ways that defy stereotyping and that are highly individualised. All this suggests that gender is not essential in the sense that it implies sameness, but also that gender is not passé or inconsequential as a factor in students experiences of specialist IT courses. Gender relations are a fundamental and inescapable feature of students' experiences of the IT curriculum in practice at KHS.",,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/1047",,,,"en",,,,,"University of Canterbury.

The aims of this study were (1) develop a psychometrically sound, cost effective, three-step multiple gating behaviour screening procedure that teachers could use in their kindergarten/classroom so that they could identify those students at-risk of antisocial development, (2) examine if the third gate of this procedure was necessary for the accurate identification of these students, and (3) could such a screening procedure be adapted for classroom teacher use in New Zealand kindergartens and schools.  Forty eight teachers from three kindergartens and 10 primary/intermediate schools volunteered for the study, of which 34 teachers completed all three gates of the screening procedure.  Results indicate the three gate screening procedure was easily adapted for kindergarten and classroom use with, at Gate 3, teachers’ self-recording 30 direct observations of a nominated and control student during their normal teaching lesson with good accuracy.  All three gates were effective in identifying those students at-risk of antisocial development but Gates 1 and 2 were the most effective in terms of accuracy, time and resourcing.

"10207","10092/806",,,"Owusu, Kofi Acheaw",,,,,,,,"2014",,,"Technological pedagogical content knowledge (TPACK) is the knowledge required for effective technology integration in teaching. In this study, New Zealand high school science teachers’ TPACK was assessed through an online survey. The data and its analysis revealed that New Zealand’s high school science teachers in general had a high perception of their understanding of TPACK and its related constructs. Science teachers had high mean scores on all the constructs on a five- point Likert scale except technological knowledge. There is thus an indication that science teachers in New Zealand perceived themselves as being able to teach with technology effectively.  Correlation analysis revealed that all six constructs correlated significantly with TPACK (also referred to as TPCK). Multiple and stepwise regression analyses revealed that Technological Pedagogical Knowledge (TPK) and Technological Content Knowledge (TCK) made statistically significant unique contributions to Technological Pedagogical Content Knowledge (TPCK). Pre-registered teachers indicated that their levels of TCK and Pedagogical Content Knowledge (PCK) were lower than more experienced teachers. This implied that recently graduated teachers found it difficult to appropriate the affordances of technology to affect the content they taught. Also, these recently graduated teachers lacked the experience to represent content in a format that made it comprehensible to their learners.
The contextual factors that influenced teachers’ use of technology as well as teachers’ TPACK levels were investigated through multiple embedded case studies of six teachers who were regular users of technology in their teaching. The case studies revealed that science teachers used technology to support inquiry learning in a wide range of ways in lower levels of high school but mostly to clarify concepts and theories when it came to the senior level of high school. Teachers demonstrated different levels of expertise and engagement in the use of technology for transferring different types of knowledge from one teaching and learning context to another and for addressing differences amongst learners. This signalled that science teachers’ TPACK apparent developmental levels shifted depending on the context of the assessment requirements of the students. This is a major finding in this study because although previous researchers have assumed that context influences teachers’ TPACK characteristics and development, this study provides evidence of how specific aspects of context influences teachers’ TPACK. This evidence shows examples of how the development of an individual’s TPACK can be considered as dynamic where the interacting constructs and characteristics shift and change based on the context. 
The recommendations from this study propose that teacher education programmes should ensure that there is a focus on teaching preservice teachers how to appropriate the affordances of technology to teach specific content instead of teaching one technology skills based course. The evidence from this study indicates that teachers in New Zealand schools use collegial approaches in the use of technology. Therefore professional learning programmes should target groups of teachers in the same school or cluster of schools rather than targeting individual teachers. This will enable teachers to share ideas and provide leadership for their colleagues in terms of how to use technology. Again, technology related professional development programmes should move away from enriching teachers’ technological skills to emphasising how teachers can appropriate the affordances of technology in their classroom practices to meet their instructional goals as well as students’ learning outcomes. There is a consequent obligation for teacher educators, educationists and stakeholders to enable teachers  to understand how best to harness the increased knowledge retrieval capacity that Information and Communication Technology affords, its information sharing abilities as well as the capacity to engage young people to act as experimenters, designers and creators of knowledge.",,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/9254",,,,"en",,,,,"University of Canterbury.

"19161","10092/806",,,,"Bechsgaard, Aase Møllemose",,,,,,,"2018",,,"Six experienced counsellors in New Zealand participated in semi-structured interviews and
reflected on how solution-focused supervision could meet their needs for clinical supervision. The
participating counsellors all use a solution-focused approach to some extent within their practice.
The thesis describes whether, and how, these counsellors found solution-focused supervision useful
for their professional practice and how it was used in their clinical supervision. This qualitative
study takes a social constructionist stance, and a solution-focused approach framed the interview
guide. Mind maps and a thematic analytic frame were used to organise and analyse the data.

Clinical counselling supervision based on a solution-focused approach can, according to the
results of this study, have a valuable role in meeting the needs of securing safe and effective
professional counselling practice and supplying restorative support. The study also suggests that
solution-focused supervision can be a useful resource for ongoing professional growth and
development. The importance of the supervisory relationship stands out, and the participants’
detailed description of how a solution-focused approach was used in their supervision can inspire
both counsellors and their supervisors. In addition to the positive findings, the study also described
limitations in the use of a solution-focused approach in counselling supervision, including a need to
give sufficient time and attention to the issue brought into supervision.

Based on this study, further research is worthwhile to explore the role of solution-focused
supervision. Further research into how solution-focused supervision might be useful for counsellors
working from other modalities and whether different supervisory modalities present variations in
the significance of the positive supervisory relationship is also suggested. Further research on a
potential positive client outcome of solution-focused supervision is tentatively suggested.
Implications for supervisors and counsellors are discussed, and more research using thematic
analysis and mind maps is recommended.",,,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/15533",,,"en","English",,,,"University of Canterbury",,,,,,,"http://library.canterbury.ac.nz/thesis/etheses_copyright.shtml","All Rights Reserved",,,,,,,,,,,,"How does solution-focused supervision respond to the needs of experienced counsellors for clinical supervision?",,,"Electronic Thesis or Dissertation",,,"Counselling","University of Canterbury",,"Masters",,,"Master of Counselling",,,,,"College of Education, Health and Human Development, University of Canterbury",,"aase@bxgaard.dk",,,,,,,,,"Dr Lois Tonkin"

As a nation that is divided by an ethnic conflict that spanned almost three decades, Sri Lanka urgently requires an ongoing peace process. High quality education for the younger generation can provide the positive force for generating peace and preventing from future conflicts. This study investigated how Olympism education could strengthen conflict resolution competencies among primary students in ethnically divided societies in Sri-Lanka. This research examined the initiatives first by coming across the impact of education in promoting peace among Sri Lankan primary students. Secondly, the study provided an explanation for the potential of Olympism in conflict resolution and promoting peace among Sri Lankan primary students.  
The study introduced an integrated model of Olympism values and conflict resolution strategies, and this program was trialed in two primary schools one each of the two main ethnic groups of Singhalese and Tamils in Sri Lanka. A mixed method approach was used and data was collected using surveys and interviews. In each school, there was one group that was taught the programme and was the experimental group, and there was a control group not taught the programme. The pre and post-test survey data from all students in the control and experimental groups were analysed according to four hypothesises using Analysis of Variance. The interviews of 16 students from the experimental group from both schools were analysed thematically and contributed data about students’ perspectives. 
This study aimed to discover possible unifying factors and attain a more holistic view about the nexus of Olympism, physical education and conflict resolution. Considering the effects of the intervention, the most notable finding of this study was that conflict resolution and Olympism education integrated curriculum intervention significantly improved experimental group students’ conflict resolution competencies. It was also found that students’ conflict resolution competencies improved regardless of their gender or ethnicity. The experimental group students also had an increase in Olympism competencies. The competencies that students had the greatest change were related to physical, social, critical and conflict resolution literacy. The findings from the interviews supported the stages of Mezirow’s Transformative Learning theory. This research concluded that strategically designed and carefully managed Olympism lessons could help students to develop and enhance competencies of conflict resolution.",,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/6682",,,,"en",,,,,"University of Canterbury.

"10453","10092/806",,,,,"Rasheed, Mollah Mohammed Haroon Ar",,,,,,"2011",,,"This investigation reports on a study that explores the views of students, teachers and parents about the Communicative Language Teaching (CLT) approach in learning English as a second language in Bangladesh. This study focuses on the improvement of English language outcomes in Bangladesh. Though compulsory for fifteen years of schooling, public examination results indicate that students perform poorly in English. This research is conducted at the secondary schools in Bangladesh where English is compulsory because of its global nature as the second or foreign language. Mainstream students learning English using the Communicative Language Teaching (CLT) approach are facing many challenges. 

The study employs a mixed methods approach which includes qualitative interviews, semi-structured focus group interviews and observations; and quantitative data involved achievement tests to find gaps between oral and written attainment, in order to determine the effectiveness of CLT developing language skills to communicate in and outside the classrooms. ESL learners in Bangladesh have been using CLT for nearly two decades, but the attainments are not satisfactory particularly in oral language (listening and speaking) compared to written language (reading and writing). Four schools (two high and two low achievement) were selected from two divisional cities according to the public examination results. Five students, all English subject teachers and five parents from each school were invited randomly to participate.

Findings indicated a confirmation of the gap between oral and written language achievements and highlighted that CLT is not working effectively to develop communicative competence to the learners. The participants identified several factors causing this. Among these were large class sizes (number of students), an extensive curriculum, insufficient class time (duration), an inappropriate examination system, excessive teacher workload, lack of parent awareness of CLT, and negative relationships between home and school. All of these factors impact on the effectiveness of CLT in Bangladesh. 

All participants agreed that CLT as an approach is better than other approaches used in Bangladesh to develop English language learning, but the varied interpretation and implementation (practice) makes it less effective. Therefore, they suggested some issues for local and national level policy makers that could enhance the CLT practice in Bangladesh.",,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/9450",,,,"en",,,,,"University of Canterbury.

The literature review provided evidence of concerns about privacy and security of information and a lack of full consumer involvement. Healthcare organisations must be prepared to anticipate and manage changes that will accompany the implementation of this new health information management system. With the promotion of EHRs by the US president, the UK government and the New Zealand Government’s health Information Strategy 2005 and the setting up of the New Zealand IT Health Plan makes future implementation and use of EHRs very likely. The objective of this study was to investigate the attitudes that Chinese and Korean health consumers in Christchurch hold towards the sharing of their health information in the EHR. The study further investigated how well informed that Chinese and Korean people are regarding the use and security of their health information.
Participants (n=201) from a non-randomized convenience sample were recruited from affiliated and non-affiliated members of the Canterbury Partnership Health Organisation and who lived in the city of Christchurch. The strategy from recruitment was designed to search for people living in Christchurch who identify themselves as Chinese or Korean. The survey instrument, a self-assessment questionnaire, was completed by participants either by pencil and paper or online. Data comprised of subjects’ demographics, utilisation of health services and selected measure on perceptions of EHRs (computer use, EHR benefits and problems, and EHR security measures). Descriptive, crosstabulatons/chi-square statistics were also evaluated.
xviii
The findings of the study showed that neither gender nor age influenced the participants’ concerns about confidentiality of information in their medical record. Gender considered an important variable in the cross-cultural populations was relatively a non-significant influence with most of the variables examined except with the participants’ awareness of EHRs. Age appeared to have been more influential for participants associations with the selected measures. Computer use was negatively associated with security concerns for health information, that is the more people, used computers the less concerned they were regarding security.
The study findings highlight the general concerns about security, confidentiality and privacy associated with health consumers and their medical records. The significant contributions of this study include the attitudes of Korean and Chinese ethnic groups and the implementation of EHRs. The findings may aid in implementing EHRs in a cultural sensitive manner, for example by (incorporating Yin and Yan; and Qi concepts). Areas of future research were highlighted such as (conducting qualitative research using focus groups or widening the geographic area to include Chinese and Korean people from New Zealand’s three or four largest cities such as Auckland). In conclusion the results provide evidence/empirical support on the perceptions of Chinese and Korean people toward EHRs and their medical information.",,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/9350",,,,"en",,,,,"University of Canterbury.

My research employed a pragmatic case study (PCS) method to systematically study the self-efficacy experiences of four New Zealand adolescents throughout the solution-focused process.  Each client participated in up to five counselling sessions.  Following the PCS method my study began with a presentation of my guiding conception which detailed my theoretical approach and the ways in which solution-focused skills and techniques would be applied throughout the study.  Case data included analysis of all client counselling sessions and final interviews which were video-recorded, as well as the consideration of a quantitative measurement in the form of the Outcome Rating Scale (ORS).  Through analysis of outcome results and using three inductively derived themes to guide cross-case analysis, it was found that the solution-focused counselling process, assisted adolescents in discovering and developing their knowledge and awareness of their personal strengths and resources; encouraged adolescents to feel empowered to act upon these resources, therefore enhancing self-efficacy; and used the quality of the therapeutic relationship to give adolescents a sense of being a co-participator in the counselling process and as a result gave adolescents a ‘boost’ towards taking action, therefore increasing self-efficacy.  Process and thematic results, supported by a brief quantitative measure, showed that all four clients made significant progress towards achieving their goals for counselling.  Overall the results suggest that the solution-focused process contributed to positive therapeutic outcome and gains in self-efficacy.  All four clients demonstrated the confidence to take action to bring about positive change in relation to their counselling goals, supporting enhanced self-efficacy.",,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/9352",,,,"en",,,,,"University of Canterbury.

Online and blended learning can be more effective than simple face-to-face modes of education and this new approach is spreading. Studies have identified factors that influence the implementation of e-learning. These include the teacher’s convictions, as well as the socio-economic and technological environment such as connectivity (bandwidth) and accessibility, the adequacy of telecommunications infrastructure, and the availability of a reliable power supply. 

The current research aimed to inform our understanding of how e-learning is developing, at one university in Saudi Arabia. To achieve this aim, a case study was conducted at X Saudi Arabian university, chosen because it adopted e-learning relatively early in the tertiary education context, so that lessons learnt there can inform practice elsewhere. A qualitative approach was used in order to obtain rich data on the experiences of individuals and systems at the university. Data were obtained from in-depth interviews of staff, observations of practice, and analysis of institutional documents and resources. In particular, four instructors and their web-enhanced courses, supported by an e-learning centre, were considered. These four cases were chosen as examples of differing experiences and backgrounds in using e-learning at X University.

The findings stress the importance of building a strategy adapted to a specific e-learning environment and the context of the particular institution conducting e-learning. Consistent with previous research in other contexts, they highlighted the importance of the teacher’s convictions about e-learning and the way they affect the practice of e-learning in the classroom at X University.

A qualitative descriptive study design was selected to investigate the experiences of male adolescents, focusing on their perceptions of societal and masculine influences on their asthma management. Individual semi-structured interviews were undertaken with 15 male adolescents to capture data about their perceptions of masculinity, asthma management, interpersonal relationships, and their physical wellbeing. Findings support previous research illustrating that asthma restricts adolescent male’s lives, both at school and recreationally. This study established that these restrictions could unpredictably affect perceived masculine ideals and their ability to be independent, strong, muscular, and competitive. Consequently, the majority of participants felt their masculinity was challenged and described feeling different, isolated, and/or marginalised from their non-asthmatic peers. To counteract these feelings, maintain control, and seek normality in front of peers, most participants reported downplaying their asthma symptoms and/or did not adhere to their prescribed treatment regimes. In addition, hegemonic representations of males as ‘tough’ and ‘self-reliant’ influenced most participants to describe re-active, non-help seeking behaviours, and minimisation of their asthma symptoms. However not all participants described adverse outcomes, with a minority resisting hegemonic ideals by taking care of their health and asthma management.

The aim of this research is to examine the role e-learning could have in the training of community pharmacists. The premise of the project is to suggest that e-learning could provide timely and flexible options for training so a sufficient number of trained healthcare workers are in place in time for the roll-out of a healthcare service. The Medicine Use Review (MUR) service, a publically funded medication adherence intervention, was used as a case study. The MUR is a service run from some community pharmacies which aims to support patients’ adherence to a medication regime through advice and application of pharmaceutical expertise.  This case study was of interest because there were problems in providing nationwide access to the MUR service in New Zealand and discontent with aspects of the training course. 
The study design used two research tools; a case-study and two on-line questionnaires to answer the research questions. The two questionnaires were used in a nationwide survey about the MUR service and the MUR training. The first had dispensary business questions (DSQ) and the second had MUR training questions (CQ). The two questionnaires used closed ended questions for quantitative data collection and open ended for qualitative data collection. Community pharmacies from thirteen of the twenty District Health Boards (DHB) were faxed an invitation to complete one of the on-line questionnaires. Community pharmacists who had completed training for the MUR were invited to complete the CQ by the representatives at DHBs responsible for the regional pharmacy contract.
Seventy-five community pharmacists from across New Zealand responded to the survey. Results from both questionnaires included attitudinal responses to the usefulness of the MUR service, support offered for pharmacists to complete the training and their preferences for course delivery.
Cross tabulation of survey questions provided analysis of quantitative data based on dispensaries which offered the MUR service and dispensaries which did not. Over two hundred and fifty text based comments provided qualitative data, which was analyzed by categorizing into subjects and frequency of concepts. Through triangulation with quantitative results, it was concluded that on the whole the pharmacists surveyed believed the MUR service was a useful service to offer their customers.
The Dispensary Service Questionnaire (DSQ) provided quantitative data which linked dispensary activity to the business decisions to offer the service and identified commonalities in the problems experienced by New Zealand pharmacists with pharmacists offering similar adherence service overseas. These included communication skills, the pharmacists' role in the primary healthcare team and remuneration for the service.
The number of responses received from the course questionnaire (CQ) was around the size of a group that might have participated in a course. Their preferences for training may have been influenced by the age ranges of this group; forty-seven percent were in the age group of 46 – 55 years old, although there was no statistically significant association found. It was confirmed by these respondents that networking skills and cultural competencies were considered to be important for future content of training. Peer networking both face-to-face and on-line was considered a useful method of delivering training.
A model called the Environment of Planning Training (EPT) was formed from the relevant literature and survey results. This model formed the basis for a discussion aimed to guide how the model could be used by stakeholders to identify factors driving the need for on-line delivery of the professional training content.
Conclusions from this research project are: e-learning for pharmacists has the potential to support value added services; further investigation is needed into the capacity of New Zealand pharmacists to participate in e-learning before it can be used effectively; evaluation of e-learning needs to be done in the context of the healthcare service evaluation and evaluation of pharmacist practice.",,,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/8449",,,"en",,,,,"University of Canterbury.

 small groups can often produce better quality solutions than from
 individuals on their own. The role of 'monitor' or 'critic' was found to be essential for
 high-performing groups. Such groups do not happen automatically, and the role of
 tutors in helping establish and manage a collaborative environment is crucial. Student
 feedback, gained from questionnaires and follow-up interviews, was positive. There are
 differences between the culture of this country and that of overseas where the original

The rise has coincided with the increase in prevalence of overweight and obesity. The ANGELO framework recognises the role of environmental influences in weight gain. In Africa, various environmental influences have led to shifts from a traditional dietary patterns and more physical lifestyles to a “Western” dietary pattern and low physical activity. The life course perspective posits that excessive body weight can persist from adolescence to adulthood, and increase the risk of NCDs. Among adolescents the school environment is a crucial setting for the development of and, or engagement in unhealthy dietary and physical activity behaviour.
The aim of this thesis was to investigate in the school environment, the consumption of energy dense foods (EDFs) and energy dense beverages (EDBs) as are typical of a “Western” dietary pattern, and physical inactivity among a sub-group of adolescents in Nairobi, Kenya. Also, the sources of food in the school environment, and the attitudes to the importance of diet and physical activity for health were assessed. A cross-sectional survey was conducted among 402 adolescents aged 13-19 years. The adolescents were recruited from schools that cater to students from households likely to be of at least middle-income socio-economic status. Results indicate that the majority of adolescents reported the consumption of an EDB (82.3%) and EDF (88.3%) at least once during the school day. Nearly half of the adolescents consumed a meal sourced from a school lunch program (45.9%). In terms of weekly consumption, the items that were reported as frequently consumed by the highest proportion of adolescents were sugar sweetened beverages (46.5%), and pastries such as biscuits and cakes (38.8%,). Both the occasional and frequent participation in team sports (50.5%) more common than individual (27.4%) and gym based workouts (26.4%). The majority (88.1%) of adolescents acknowledged the importance of diet and exercise for health.
Rigorous measurement of diet and physical activity behaviour and knowledge and attitude of health behaviour in this thesis was limited. Also, the sample used was not representative of adolescents in Kenya. The findings of this thesis are preliminary and further research is recommended using a representative sample and validated data collection methods.

"10595","10092/806",,,"Mohd Nawi, Abdullah",,,,,,,,"2014",,,"This thesis is a reflective exploration of the use and impact of using drama pedagogies in the English as a Second Language (ESL)/ English as a Foreign Language (EFL) classroom. It stems from the problem of secondary school English language learning in Malaysia, where current teaching practices appear to have led to the decline of the standard of English as a second language in school leavers and university graduates (Abdul Rahman, 1997; Carol Ong Teck Lan, Anne Leong Chooi Khaun, & Singh, 2011; Hazita et al., 2010; Nalliah & Thiyagarajah, 1999). This problem resonates with my own experiences at school, as a secondary school student, an ESL teacher and, later, as a teacher trainer. Consequently, these experiences led me to explore alternative or supplementary teaching methodologies that could enhance the ESL learning experience, drawing initially from drama techniques such as those advocated by Maley and Duff (1983), Wessels (1987), and Di Pietro (1983), and later from process drama pedagogies such as those advocated by Greenwood (2005); Heathcote and Bolton (1995); Kao and O'Neill (1998), and Miller and Saxton (2004). This thesis is an account of my own exploration in adapting drama pedagogies to ESL/EFL teaching. It examines ways in which drama pedagogies might increase motivation and competency in English language learning. 

The main methodology of the study is that of reflective practice (e.g. Griffiths & Tann, 1992; Zeichner & Liston, 1996). It tracks a learning journey, where I critically reflect on my learning, exploring and implementing such pedagogical approaches as well as evaluate their impact on my students’ learning. These critical reflections arise from three case studies, based on three different contexts: the first a New Zealand English for Speakers of Other Languages (ESOL) class in an intermediate school, the second a Malaysian ESL class in a rural secondary school, and the third an English proficiency class of adult learners in a language school. Data for the study were obtained through the following: research journal and reflective memo; observation and field notes; interview; social media; students’ class work; discussion with co-researchers; and through the literature of the field.
 
A major teaching methodology that emerges from the reflective cycles is that of staging the textbook, where the textbook section to be used for the teaching programme is distilled, and the key focuses of the language, skills, vocabulary, and themes to be learnt are identified and extracted. A layer of drama is matched with these distilled elements and then ‘staged’ on top of the textbook unit, incorporating context-setting opportunities, potential for a story, potential for tension or complication, and the target language elements.
 
The findings that emerge through critical reflection in the study relate to the drama methodologies that I learn and acquire, the impact of these methodologies on students, the role of culture in the application of drama methodologies, and language learning and acquisition. These findings have a number of implications. Firstly, they show how an English Language Teaching (ELT) practitioner might use drama methodologies and what their impact is on student learning. While the focus is primarily on the Malaysian context, aspects of the findings may resonate internationally. Secondly, they suggest a model of reflective practice that can be used by other ELT practitioners who are interested in using drama methodologies in their teaching. Thirdly, these findings also point towards the development of a more comprehensive syllabus for using drama pedagogies, as well as the development of reflective practice, in the teacher training programmes in Malaysia.

The use of drama pedagogies for language learning is a field that has not been researched in a Malaysian context. Therefore, this account of reflective practice offers a platform for further research and reflection in this context.",,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/9584",,,,"en",,,,,"University of Canterbury.

This thesis describes a project that was designed with a focus on exploring ways to enhance leadership capacity in non-government organisations operating in Christchurch, New Zealand. It included 20 CEOs, directors and managers from organisations that cover a range of settings, including education, recreation, and residential and community therapeutic support; all working with adolescents. 
The project involved the creation of a peer-supported professional learning community that operated for 14 months; the design and facilitation of which was informed by the Appreciative Inquiry principles of positive focus and collaboration. At the completion of the research project in February 2010, the leaders decided to continue their collective processes as a self-managing and sustaining professional network that has grown and in 2014 is still flourishing under the title LYNGO (Leaders of Youth focussed NGOs).  
Two compelling findings emerged from this research project.  The first of these relates to efficacy of a complexity thinking framework to inform the actions of these leaders.   The leaders in this project described the complexity thinking framework as the most relevant, resonant and dynamic approach that they encountered throughout the research project.  As such this thesis explores this complexity thinking informed leadership in detail as the leaders participating in this project believed it offers an opportune alternative to more traditional forms of positional leadership and organisational approaches.  This exploration is more than simply a rationale for complexity thinking but an iterative in-depth exploration of ‘complexity leadership in action’ which in Chapter 6 elaborates on detailed leadership tools and frameworks for creating the conditions for self-organisation and emergence.  
The second compelling finding relates to efficacy of Appreciative Inquiry as an emergent research and development process for leadership learning. In particular the adoption of two key principles; positive focus and inclusivity were beneficial in guiding the responsive leadership learning process that resulted in a professional learning community that exhibited high engagement and sustainability. Additionally, the findings suggest that complexity thinking not only acts as a contemporary framework for adaptive leadership of organisations as stated above; but that complexity thinking has much to offer as a framework for understanding leadership development processes through the application of Appreciative Inquiry (AI)-based principles. A consideration of the components associated with complexity thinking has promise for innovation and creativity in the development of leaders and also in the creation of networks of learning. 
This thesis concludes by suggesting that leaders focus on creating hybrid organisations, ones which leverage the strengths (and minimise the limitations) of self-organising complexity-informed organisational processes, while at the same time retaining many of the strengths of more traditional organisational management structures. This approach is applied anecdotally to the place where this study was situated: the post-earthquake recovery of Christchurch, New Zealand.",,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/9885",,,,"en",,,,,"University of Canterbury.

"10682","10092/806",,,,,"Gladstone, Colin Alexander",,,,,,"2014",,,"This qualitative study is concerned with the transition process from school to post-school life for students labelled with learning disability in New Zealand. My interest is in understanding how a particular group of these young people can make a successful transition from school in their search for a good life, as they themselves judge this. I draw on critical social theory to position these young people within contemporary education and society, using a Disability Studies in Education (DSE) framework to understand learning disability as socially, culturally and politically constructed.
I draw on Zygmunt Bauman’s critique of neoliberal hegemony and use of metaphor to understand how young people with learning disability are excluded in a contemporary Western society. Post-school outcomes identify very little useful tertiary education or paid employment; long-term reliance on family for living and housing; and extremely limited social networks, mostly founded on family members and paid or voluntary support workers. I argue that these young people are caught in a parallel education system that largely controls and manages them along a restrictive pathway from special education services in schools to special vocational and welfare services post school. The clear voice of the young people through the research findings demonstrates this is not what they want. They want the same opportunities as their peers without disability.
Andrew and Caroline, two young people with Down syndrome, and I formed a research team. We came together to explore, understand and respond to an exclusionary landscape during the transition process that I argue leads to unrealised lives. The study utilises a participatory action research approach. It is a collaborative journey and a transformative response to exclusion through what I describe as “the relational dimension.” Further, it is a call to arms on behalf of a particular group of students who have been mostly excluded from rights, responsibilities and opportunities to contribute positively to their lives and the lives of others.
This thesis has been a journey of personal and professional, individual and collective discovery. Answers to the question of how young people with learning disability can transition towards a good life are to be found in how we fundamentally value this group of young people in education and society. Valuing can only occur if we recognise our
interdependence while acknowledging our unique differences. Only then will we truly provide the opportunities and support that we all need to move forward in our journey towards a good life.
This thesis will be of interest to young people; parents; education and social policy leaders; school leaders; career specialists; and all teachers, professionals and support workers in the field. Its findings and recommendations challenge “expert” and deficit constructions of learning disability. They have relevance for a collaborative “whole-school” approach to career and transition policy and practice for students with learning disability; importantly, however, they also have relevance for all students. Effective relationships are central to understanding how, through our relative interdependency; we can collaboratively make the journey towards a good life. Additionally, the thesis contributes to knowledge regarding how to meaningfully involve young people with learning disability in the research process through their lived and our shared experiences that provide ethical, methodological and procedural insights.
I develop two main arguments in this thesis. My first argument is that exclusion from educational opportunity must be exposed, challenged and rejected. Exclusion must be exposed in order to understand the unequal power mechanisms at play. Exclusion must be challenged, as the outcome of these unequal power mechanisms is that some students succeed and some fail. Exclusion must be rejected to make way for new relational, transformative education agendas. My second argument is that direct and meaningful involvement and collaboration by young people with learning disability in the research process will support practical solutions towards greater democracy in education and society. The ultimate outcome of democracy in education is a system where all students are valued and celebrated for their unique differences and stories, yet with recognition of their relative interdependency. All students are viewed as capable, purposeful, responsible and contributing. They are provided with the opportunities and support required to realise a good life, leading to active contribution and a sense of belonging in education and society.",,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/9640",,,,"en",,,,,"University of Canterbury.

This study evaluates the effects of a tailored Incredible Years Teacher Classroom Management (IYTCM) programme aimed to improve participating children’s on-task behaviour and literacy performance, as well as reducing ADHD symptoms in a group of 6 to 10 year old children with ADHD in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. Nine children, who were identified with ADHD symptoms on the basis of teacher and parental reports, were involved in the IYTCM-ADHD programme. The children’s behaviour symptoms were assessed using the Conners 3-T, Conners 3-P(S), SESBI-I, ECBI and SDQ. Ten teachers received the IYTCM-ADHD training in a full-day session once a week for 6 weeks. The children received individual behaviour plans implemented by their teachers with close supervision. A single-subject design was implemented to record the behaviour changes over time: at baseline, during teacher training with the IYTCM-ADHD programme, and at both immediate and long-term follow-ups. The on-task behaviour of children with ADHD and normative comparison children was recorded using Behavioural Observation of Students in Schools (BOSS). In addition to visual analysis, a non-parametric test Percentage of All Non-Overlapping Data (PAND) was used to examine the magnitude of effect in each child. The result of the study indicated that on-task behaviour of all the children with ADHD improved an average of 78% during the teacher training and this maintained during the follow-up phases. The children’s on-task behaviour also generalised to classrooms with non-trained teachers. Visual analysis indicated that the children’s behaviour was maintained during the follow-up phases. The pre- and post-intervention analyses of children with ADHD showed a significant effect of the intervention as a group. Clinical significance was obtained for more than half of the children on teacher reports of ADHD symptoms and conduct problems after the intervention. The literacy performance of all children with ADHD improved at the conclusion of the study.

"10830","10092/806",,,,,"Lockyer, Caroline",,,,,,"2014",,,"This research study was designed to explore the effectiveness of pedagogical practices on student literacy learning within a student television context. The study was undertaken in response to practitioner inquiry into the value and worth of school television for student literacy learning. Over the research period this project evolved into a deeply reflective self-study of teaching practice within a technological environment.
This research took place in a suburban primary school where school television had been created by students for the previous two years. Twenty-two students aged between 10 and 12 participated in three cycles of action research to investigate how pedagogy influences learning within this context.
A range of pedagogical actions designed to influence students’ critical thinking were implemented into action research cycles. The selection of actions for intervention was influenced by an investigation into current literature from the field, and an analysis of existing multi-literacy learning, pedagogical conditions and student views of teaching and learning within student television at the beginning of the research cycles.
This study gathered information during research cycles using student learning conversations and student interviews, which provided insight into learning from the point of view of students. Supporting this information were daily researcher observations and end-of-cycle interviews with classroom teachers. Through careful monitoring, analysis and reflection on each research cycle it was clear that strategic pedagogical interventions did positively influence multi-literacy learning. Rather than attempt to measure differences in student learning, this study explored how multi-literacy learning, strategic pedagogy and learning within student television inter-related with one another. This research study identified and explored the complex inter-relationships between
pedagogies and multi-literacy learning.",,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/9744",,,,"en",,,,,"University of Canterbury.

"10831","10092/806",,,,,"Thoresen, Petria Beryl",,,,,,"2014",,,"Aim: This thesis reports the outcomes of a study designed to explore whether and how ethical and responsive interviewing of children in care with varying levels of sensitivity to topics that may threaten their felt security can be achieved.
Background: Children come into care with a complex array of developmental challenges. They have often experienced maltreatment, loss and disrupted attachment relationships. Little is known about the effects of interviewing children in care with varying sensitivity to questioning strategies designed to measure felt security and their perceptions of being in care.
Methods: The present study was iteratively designed using an exploratory mixed qualitative design. Children’s reports (N= 12) were collected using a series of iteratively designed interview methodologies supplemented by information provided by their kinship carers.  
Results: The following factors influence the comfort experiences of children in care: interviewer skill, interviewer and child role, child competence (perceived and real), child characteristics, external factors, ethical factors and the interview methods. The potential influence of mental health status and age were less clear. Factors related to felt insecurity were: relational, self-perceived competence and confidentiality related factors. The maintenance of the comfort experience of children in care when interviewing, cuts across many dimensions of the research context including relational, performance and methodological aspects. Children engaged in strategies to mediate their comfort, this was somewhat reliant on the methodologies and interviewer competency. Overall acceptable levels of comfort were reported to be maintained over the span of the research process.
Conclusions: Children in care have vulnerabilities that need to be addressed when including them in research. Careful consideration to the design of studies and interview methodologies will ensure children in care can participate in protective research environments. The benefits to this are reflected in the gathering of quality data which can contribute to the timely provision of the appropriate services for children in care. The present study findings provide guidance for future research involving children in various types of alternate care.",,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/9739",,,,"en",,,,,"University of Canterbury.

The aim has been to try and ascertain if the identified attitudes and values of the participants have had any influence on career development. There were 12 participants involved and at the time of this project they were either in permanent part or full time employment with ‘The Company’. ‘The Company’ is a pseudonym given to the business where the participants worked and the setting for this research project. The workplace is situated in a remote location on an industrial work site in New Zealand. Each participant engaged in the research voluntarily. They completed a questionnaire and took part in a semi-structured interview. Confidentiality and anonymity of all participants had been respected and maintained throughout the entire project. Results show that there were three principle influences that could be attributed to the ways that participants perceived the workplace and personal career development. They were workplace values, workplace training, and workplace goals. These attributes are influenced in different ways and hold divergent meaning for individual participants. The most highly rated value, as identified by participants in this project has been variation of tasks undertaken in the workplace. This was not challenged by any of the indicators used to consider opinions and values expressed by participants; education, generational groupings, career type and work streams. Seven of the twelve participants desired promotion within ‘The Company’. The ways that participants hoped to achieve promotion was often unspecified.

"11318","10092/806",,,"Lennox Thompson, Bronwyn Fay",,,,,,,,"2015",,,"Chronic pain is a public health problem that is likely to increase as the population ages, and has few effective treatments.  Although viewed by many as profoundly distressing and disabling, there are a surprising number of people (approximately 30%) who cope well with their chronic pain and do not continue to seek treatment. There is little theory to explain how and why these individuals manage their pain well. This means there is limited knowledge about the approaches used by people who cope well and whether these strategies could help those who have more difficulty.
This thesis presents a substantive grounded theory of living well with chronic pain, the theory of re-occupying self. Seventeen individual interviews were recorded, with data collection, analysis and theory generation following classical grounded theory methodological approach. Constant comparison, theoretical sampling, theoretical coding, and theoretical sensitivity were used to identify the main concern of people who cope well with pain. This concern is achieving self-coherence, and is resolved by re-occupying self. Resolution involves making sense to develop an idiographic model of their pain; deciding to turn from patient to person, facilitated or hindered by interactions with clinicians and occupational drive; and flexibly persisting where occupational engaging and coping allow individuals to develop future plans. By completing this process, individuals form a coherent self-concept in which they re-occupy the important or valued aspects of themselves. 
This study supports using Acceptance and Commitment Therapy because of its functional contextual view of people and their actions. This study illustrates that coping strategies are used in different ways depending on the primary goal within that context. Occupations, or active; purposeful; meaningful; contextualised and human activities, are used by people to make sense of their situation, and as a key motivation for developing coping strategies. These findings lead to new research questions about values-aligned activity, coping with identity change, and acceptance.",,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/10282",,,,"en",,,,,"University of Canterbury.

"11173","10092/806",,,,,"Fry, Juliet Ruth",,,,,,"2014",,,"The purpose of this study was twofold: to find out how teachers of English as an Additional Language (EAL) conceived curriculum, teaching and learning and to examine how professional learning and development (PLD) might impact on changes in the teachers’ thinking and approaches. The research was spurred by my own involvement in the revision of the national New Zealand Curriculum (NZC) and interest in the contested nature of curriculum related to English language learning. EAL teachers face challenges addressing the cross-Learning Area positioning of EAL and, at the same time, are afforded significant autonomy. PLD is needed to support teachers to make curriculum decisions that support English language learners’ (ELLs) to develop competency in English language with urgency. This is because ELLs need to manage the English language demands as they engage in the complex learning that is articulated in the NZC, along with their peers.

I adopted an action research methodology to explore both how EAL teachers conceived curriculum and how PLD about EAL teaching and learning might impact on shifts in teachers’ understanding. I was a practitioner-researcher as I carried out PLD for two teachers over a period of six months. Those teacher-participants were teachers of EAL from different secondary schools with different professional contexts. Teaching-as-inquiry was the predominant approach of the PLD. This approach was consistent with my action research. The PLD comprised of a range of interruptions to teachers’ everyday work that assisted them to explore their own practice. The research drew on records of these interruptions to provide evidence of changes in teacher-participants’ thinking. The recorded conversations were captured through semi-structured interviews, video-stimulated recall and ‘learning conversations’. This qualitative data was analysed in one cycle which explored teachers’ thinking and actions about EAL curriculum. A second cycle focused my recorded reflections about my practice and on the impact of particular forms of PLD facilitation on shifts in the teachers’ thinking and actions. I created a review of literature for each cycle. This recursive process allowed me to reflect on my role as a PLD facilitator in action.


Several themes emerged as the cycles were drawn together to examine how PLD impacted on shifts in teachers’ understanding of curriculum for EAL. One theme that emerged was the value of a culture of inquiry, where my action research was linked with the participants’ teaching-as-inquiry cycles. Another theme related to how PLD could influence teachers’ reconceptualising of curriculum for teaching
multilingual English language learners. A third theme was how my PLD facilitation could impact on effective teaching and learning for Pasifika learners.
Findings can be drawn from my study for both teacher practice and for PLD facilitation. This research adds to New Zealand research about teaching ELLs, and Pasifika students in particular. It shows how giving attention to both students’ home language strengths and academic English language learning needs can change the way teachers see pathways and work towards improved outcomes for students. The value of inquiry for teachers was confirmed in this action research, as a useful approach for bring about change in teachers’ thinking and approaches to teaching. The PLD interruption process, which included analysis of rich information about students, challenging conversations and the maintenance of respectful relationships was confirmed as an effective combination for engaging teachers in shifting their foci. Self-reflections on my PLD facilitation role, using an inquiry approach, assessed through adult learning principles, provided a useful stocktake which I would recommend for other PLD facilitators.",,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/9956",,,,"en",,,,,"University of Canterbury.

"11236","10092/806",,,,,"Barrett, Trudy-Ann",,,,,,"2014",,,"The nurturance of creative capacity and cultural awareness have been identified as important 21st century concerns, given the ways that globalisation has challenged cultural diversity. This thesis explores the share that the art classroom, as a formative place, has in supporting such concerns. It specifically examines artmaking strategies that visual arts teachers may use to help adolescent students to develop and negotiate their senses of self, place and community. Held within this goal is the assumption that both student and teacher perspectives are important to this endeavor. This thesis, accordingly, draws upon empirical work undertaken with lower secondary school level visual art students in Christchurch, New Zealand and teacher-trainees in Kingston, Jamaica to explore this potential in multi-dimensional ways. 
The research employs a qualitative, arts-based methodology, centred on the transformative capacity of ‘visual knowing’ to render this potential visible. A/r/tography as a particular strand of arts-based methodology, served to also implicate my artist-researcher-teacher roles in the study to facilitate both reflection and reflexivity and to capture the complexity and dynamics of the study. Multiple case studies provided the contexts to furnish these possibilities, and to theorize the intrinsic qualities of each case, as well as the complementary aspects of the inquiry in depth. The conceptual framework that underpins this study draws widely on scholarship relating to contemporary artmaking practices, visual culture, culturally responsive and place-conscious pedagogical practices. 
The research findings reveal that when the artmaking experience is framed around the personal and cultural experiences of the participants, both students and teachers participate in the enterprise meaningfully as co-constructors of knowledge. In this process, students develop the confidence to bring their unique feelings, experiences and understandings to the artmaking process, and develop a sense of ‘insideness’ that leads to strong senses of self, place and community. This also creates a space where the authentic interpretation of artmaking activities goes beyond the creation of borders around cultural differences, and instead generates multiple entry points for students to engage with information.
The findings also indicate that while the nature of artmaking is improvisatory and emergent, structure is an integral element in the facilitation of habits toward perception and meaning making. Accordingly, emphases on structured, open-ended artmaking experiences, framed aesthetically, as well as exposure to both the products and processes of contemporary art serve this endeavor. Artmaking boundaries and enabling structures also help to supplement this process.
Though this research is limited in scope (in terms of the community engagement), there exists evidence that collaboration with community resource persons enlarges students’ conceptions of artmaking. It presents the potential to address broad issues of local and global import, which also have relevance for the ways students understand their relationships with the world. For researchers outside of the school and community culture however, this process requires close working relations with school personnel to ensure its effectiveness and to facilitate those school-community bridges. The undertaking is also best realized when participants have their own senses of its value, and, as such, are more inclined to participate. 
A/r/tography, as an arts-based methodology presents much potential for examining the complexities of the artmaking experience. As a form of active inquiry it helps those who employ its features to be more attuned toward enquiry, their ways of being in the world, the ways the personal may be negotiated in a community of belonging, and the development of practices that address difference. This contributes to evolving and alternative research possibilities that value visual forms of ‘knowing’.
Finally, this thesis addresses the paucity of research on visual arts education at the secondary level, especially in the Jamaican context. A significant feature of this research is the evidence of its effectiveness with both lower secondary school students and teachers across geographical contexts. It therefore presents the potential for similar studies to be undertaken internationally. Given that the results are site specific however, it is recommended that the adaptation of the framework of this study for future purposes also respond to the specific realities of those contexts.",,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/10040",,,,"en",,,,,"University of Canterbury.

"11240","10092/806",,,"McMaster, Christopher Todd",,,,,,,,"2014",,,"This qualitative study is concerned with the development of inclusive values and practices in an Aotearoa New Zealand school. It focuses on the experiences of staff and leadership in the development of inclusive culture within their school. Since the launch of Special Education 2000 in 1996, it has been the stated aspiration of the Ministry of Education to create a ‘world class inclusive education system’. This thesis is part of an effort to assist schools, in the Aotearoa New Zealand context, to get closer to the aspiration of inclusion. It is hoped that this research can contribute to the sustainable development of inclusion within our schools, and that the values expressed by the ideal of inclusion can become firmly rooted in our learning communities. 

The research involved embedding myself in an Aotearoa New Zealand co-educational high school as a qualitative critical ethnographic researcher. Using participatory observation and semi-formal and informal interviews I examined the experiences of a school community developing inclusive values. During an academic year the school utilised a framework for inclusive change known as the Index for Inclusion. The Index provided the framework in which the school community could explore their values, how those values were translated into practice, and to guide the change process. 

My analysis drew on hermeneutic phenomological theoretical perspectives underpinned by a social constructionist epistemology. I utilise a theoretical construct of culture, or model, in which to frame the change process within the subject school. The tension between neoliberalism and inclusion based on social justice, and between a model of special education and definitions of ‘disability’ and ‘inclusion’ creates a dynamic that enables the co-creation of knowledge as well as possible futures.  The methodology I employed was critical ethnography. Critical ethnography allows the researcher to become a participant in the project. Using a critical ethnographic methodology, the researcher/researched relationship was also a pedagogic relationship. Throughout the year of this study the staff at the subject school reflected on the core values of their school and made changes necessary to begin to align their practice with those values. 

I argue that inclusion is linked to culture, and as a result, efforts to create a ‘world class inclusive education system’ must take place in the setting of the school culture. As culture is multi-layered, the change process requires time, perseverance, and at times involves pain. Change involves a renegotiation of meaning and a negotiation of expression. I argue that in a devolved educational system such as Aotearoa New Zealand, the individual school provides a ‘shady place’ in which work can be carried out to counter neoliberal policies and inculcate values of inclusion based on social justice. An ancillary argument in this thesis is that no research is neutral, and that it is an ethical responsibility of the researcher to be aware of whom their research benefits. This awareness does not compromise research; it gives research relevance.",,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/10059",,,,"en",,,,,"University of Canterbury.

The subjects are 29 students attending a New Zealand residential special school for boys with SEBD.  Through voicing their views on their schooling experiences and suggesting ideas for improvement, the boys provided educators and policymakers with a better understanding of ways in which the schooling experience of boys with SEBD can be more positive and successful.   

A qualitative research design was utilised to gain the students’ insights into the salient features of their mainstream and residential schooling experiences.  In order to highlight student voices in the research process and thesis writing, a phenomenological approach was utilised to shape the core methodology.  Interviewing was chosen as the primary method of data collection for the analysis.  In-depth, semi-structured interviews raised a number of salient features of the boys’ schooling experiences.
The findings are summarised and merged into three main themes; the mainstream school experience, the residential school experience, and boys’ suggestions and recommendations for school improvement. 

The findings suggest a considerable degree of consistency between the boys concerning the difficulties experienced in mainstream schools. They highlight the importance of cultivating strong, positive student-teacher relationships and relationships among peers; the need for more effective disciplinary practices; the need to recognise the learning needs of students with SEBD as a priority; and the need to address bullying issues more effectively.	

The findings also provide valuable insights into some of the ways in which placement in a residential school for boys with SEBD are perceived to be effective for these students. The benefits of a residential school programme identified by the boys included improved learning and behaviour, improved relationships with others, and a greater capacity to deal with difficult feelings. The factors enabling these improvements were identified and included positive relationships with teachers, effective behavioural management based on fair sanctions and rewards, small classes, teachers’ instructions, the availability of academic support, better relationships with peers, and an effective anti-bullying policy.",,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/10129",,,,"en",,,,,"University of Canterbury.

The Treaty is an agreement that was signed in 1840 by representatives of the British Crown and representatives of independent Māori hapū (sub-tribe). The failure of the Crown to uphold the Treaty plus the colonisation of New Zealand has held wide-ranging ramifications for Māori, including a negative impact on Māori education. Policy guidelines both at a national level and locally at the University of Canterbury provide requirements and guidelines for teachers and teacher educators in relation to the Treaty. The aim of many of these guidelines is to address equity issues in education and to support Māori ākonga (students) to achieve success as Māori.
This thesis draws upon data from interviews with five teacher educators from the University of Canterbury, College of Education to explore their understandings of the Treaty and how these understandings inform their practice. A qualitative research approach was applied to this study. Semi-structured interviews were used and a grounded theory approach to the data analysis was applied. Three key themes arose from the data and these provided insights into the teacher educator participants’ understandings of the Treaty, how they acquired Treaty knowledge and their curriculum decision making. Bronfenbrenner’s (1979) ecological systems theory approach was used as a framework to situate how the teacher educators’ understandings of the Treaty have developed. Critical theory and concepts associated with critical pedagogy underpin this research. Critical pedagogy highlights the importance for teacher educators in New Zealand to have an understanding of the historical and contemporary complexities of educational issues related to the Treaty.",,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/10254",,,,"en",,,,,"University of Canterbury.

The focus of the study is on the analysis of early childhood teachers’ beliefs about how they can support English acquisition among Asian immigrant ELLs and how these beliefs influence the teachers’ practices in early childhood education (ECE) settings. 

The theoretical framework of this research draws on a range of sociocultural perspectives, including (i) the sociocultural positions initially defined by Lev Vygostky (1978), (ii) the notion of guided participation articulated by Barbara Rogoff (2003), (iii) theories of second language acquisition discussed by Lantolf and Thorne (2000), and by Krashen (1982, 1985), and (iv) acculturation as addressed by Berry (2001). 

The main participants of this study were seven early childhood teachers and six Asian immigrant ELLs from two ECE centres. Four Asian parents participated in interviews to ascertain the parents’ perspectives about their children’s learning of English and their maintenance of home language. Research methods for the teachers included observations and semi-structured pre- and post-observation interviews. For each centre, observations were carried out over a six week period which enabled a series of snapshots of how the teachers supported the ELLs as they acquired English.
	
The findings were analysed using thematic analysis, and presented three themes: English dominance, social cultural adaptation, and guided participation. These themes impacted the learning experiences of the Asian immigrant ELLs and other children attending the ECE as well as the teaching approaches of the early childhood teachers. The findings revealed that there were dissonances between the teachers’ beliefs and their practices, as well as variation between individual teachers’ beliefs and practices. Because of a significant increase in the number of ELLs in New Zealand ECE centres, it is important for early childhood teachers to understand the emphasis upon sociocultural theories in the ECE curriculum, so that they can effectively apply these theories to their practices. This study will provide a basis from which to consider how early childhood teachers in New Zealand can draw upon sociocultural perspectives to better support ELLs as they acquire English, while valuing and supporting their linguistic and cultural backgrounds.",,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/10382",,,,"en",,,,,"University of Canterbury.

culturally responsive curriculum and schooling. It investigates how some schools have
formed genuine education partnerships with iwi, and provides answers to the following
question: in what ways are iwi and schools working together to support Māori students?
An understanding of communities of practice, and what Māori student success looks like,
are essential. Imperatives for education partnerships and the educational policy, and
drivers for partnership are foundational in understanding and connecting collaboration
between iwi and schools with the wider educational picture in Aotearoa New Zealand.
In New Zealand, Māori are not as successful as their non-Māori peers. Approaches to
achieving education equity, including collaboration with iwi and Māori, is important for
informing education approaches and strategy. How those approaches are informed,
developed and implemented is equally important in achieving models likely to positively
affect Māori achievement in education. This is also important in ensuring that
participation expectations of iwi are co-constructed, reasonable and appropriately
resourced.
The theoretical base of this study draws upon the literature review on collaboration
between Māori/iwi and the New Zealand education system, as well as international
literature on supporting Indigenous students, using a community of practice approach.
The metaphor of ‘puna kōrero’ is used in this research, as an approach allowing for
consideration of different sites of investigation using an organic, kaupapa (issue, topic)
Māori perspective. The three puna kōrero explored are Te Kauhua: A Ministry of
Education funded professional development programme for schools and iwi; iwi voices:
six iwi education representatives speak about their experiences working with schools and
advancing their iwi education aspirations; Wai Study Help: an English-literacy
programme operating in a kura kaupapa Māori (Māori immersion schooling) setting that
has partnerships with its local university and iwi. From these puna kōrero, implications
for iwi, schools and the Ministry of Education are considered.
iii
Exploration of the three puna kōrero identified passionate leadership and purposeful
membership, funding and resourcing, monitoring and defining success,
whakawhanaungatanga (nurturing relationships with others) and involvement of whānau
(family) as key themes. Motivations for schools and iwi to work together are explored,
along with rationale for the Ministry of Education’s support of iwi-school communities of
practice. A framework for iwi-school communities of practice is proposed, including
recommendations for iwi, schools and the Ministry of Education.",,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/10250",,,,"en",,,,,"University of Canterbury.

However, when a community lacks expertise in 21st century practices, learning these skills through shared practice becomes difficult. E-learning is often marketed as if the tools were easy to adopt and adapt, but effective professional development is required to support educators in learning to employ e-learning tools in their practice. Research shows that effective professional development is timely, relevant, flexible, and often collaborative in nature with examples of good practice. The research presented in this thesis describes the design and implementation of professional development which supports a community of practitioners in building the expertise to incorporate e-learning within its professional practice. The research was informed by a comprehensive review of literature on professional development, with a focus on the area of e-learning, the theory behind the communities of practice concept, and the application of that theory. A design-based methodology was employed to gather data from a range of sources of evidence, over two years, in four iterative cycles of collaborative design, implementation, evaluation and redesign. The context in which the research took place was a small educational organisation with an average of twenty staff members over the duration of the study. This staged implementation of an online environment, designed in collaboration with the community, supported the development of a blended community of online practice and provided timely, relevant professional development in e-learning. Analysis of the research findings produced two instruments: (1) a matrix of strategies for enabling and supporting the development of a blended community of online practice, and (2) a heuristic model to guide the investigation of the learning taking place within the online aspect of a blended community of online practice. These instruments are recommended to designers, developers or researchers supporting the development of a blended community of online practice and the professional development taking place in its online environment.",,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/10157",,,,"en",,,,,"University of Canterbury.

"11175","10092/806",,,"Purvis, Caralyn Jan",,,,,,,,"2014",,,"Pre-service teachers have a large role to play in initiatives to raise children’s literacy achievement. There is growing concern about the disparity of reading abilities of children, particularly in New Zealand, prompting a greater need to examine the skills and knowledge of the adults who provide reading instruction to these children. Adults engaged in higher education are typically expected to possess strong and proficient literacy skills, yet research examining the literacy skills of the broader adult population reports adult literacy levels to be much lower than assumed. Well over a third of adults in countries including the United States of America and New Zealand do not possess basic literacy skills. There is a paucity of research identifying and addressing the literacy needs of the adult population. Further, there have been limited studies investigating the literacy abilities of adults with relatively higher levels of literacy skill (e.g., those in higher education). Such research is particularly pertinent in the education context due to the influence that teaching professionals have on future generations of readers.

The research reported in this thesis investigated the reading comprehension and metalinguistic abilities of pre-service teachers, and conducted two interventions within this population. The first intervention focussed on improving the reading comprehension of individuals who presented with difficulties understanding written text relative to their peers. The second intervention provided explicit instruction in building students’ language structure knowledge within general coursework completed by a whole cohort of pre-service teachers. The findings from this thesis have implications for the provision of support for pre-service teachers with literacy needs in higher education, as well as for augmenting the skills of the broader pre-service teacher population to prepare them to deliver evidence-based reading instruction. 

The first study (presented in Chapter Four) assessed selected cognitive and literacy skills of a cohort of undergraduate pre-service teachers in their initial year of higher education. One-hundred and thirty-one students completed an assessment battery comprising tasks of spelling, reading comprehension, inferencing, working memory, and knowledge of language structure. Analysis of results demonstrated a wide range of abilities across each of the measures, reflecting the large variance in skill with which these individuals enter into higher education. Spelling, inferencing, and working memory were each found to make significant unique contributions to reading comprehension. Furthermore, the elements contributing towards reading comprehension were found to be highly interactive, thus demonstrating the complex interactive nature of the skills that contribute to the reading comprehension process in these individuals. 

In the second study (presented in Chapter Five) individuals with difficulties understanding written text were identified using the reading comprehension measure from the first study. Individuals who performed more than one standard deviation below the group mean were identified for inclusion in a reading comprehension intervention. Seventeen individuals met the criteria for inclusion in the intervention and consented to participate (referred to as the IN group). Two control groups were also identified to allow for comparisons to be made pre- and post-intervention. The first control group, referred to as the NT group (n = 6), comprised of six participants who qualified for the intervention but who opted not to participate. The second control group, referred to as the CN group (n = 83), comprised of the remaining students from the large cohort. Four different strategies designed to assist with reading comprehension were modelled and practiced with each participant in the IN group over four sessions. Each intervention session focussed on one strategy alone and the intervention was administered on an individual basis. Reading comprehension and summarising assessments were completed following every session to ascertain the effectiveness of each strategy. Results showed that the first strategy (text-to-speech) was detrimental to the participants’ reading comprehension scores, while a further strategy (highlighting and summarising) was beneficial for almost all participants. There was a significant gain in reading comprehension score by the IN group after completing the intervention. Neither the NT nor the CN group, however, made any improvement in reading comprehension over this time period. The results also demonstrated that the improvement made by the IN participants increased their mean reading comprehension score to within range of the CN group (i.e., their peers identified with typical ability at the outset of the study).

A third study (presented in Chapter Six) examined the responsiveness of the intervention participants to the reading comprehension intervention at a subgroup and individual level. Four subgroups of participants were identified based on their underlying literacy profile at the outset of the intervention. The first group (n = 2) comprised individuals with poor spelling; the second (n = 4), individuals with poor listening comprehension; the third (n = 1), those with poor spelling and listening comprehension; and the fourth (n = 10), individuals who did not demonstrate poor spelling or listening comprehension. There were no differences in the responsiveness of these groups to the four different strategies. There was also no association between an individual’s literacy profile and their response to the various strategies. Furthermore, closer examination of four case studies (one from each of the four subgroups) did not demonstrate any clear relationship between the responsiveness to the four different reading comprehension strategies, and their literacy profile. 

Finally, the fourth study (presented in Chapter Seven) examined the responsiveness of the whole cohort (n = 121) to a teaching intervention targeting metalinguistic knowledge. Two subgroups were identified within the larger cohort based on participants’ word-level skill (determined by spelling ability): good spellers (n = 24), and poor spellers (n = 24). Two subgroups were also identified based on participants’ comprehension-level skills (determined by reading comprehension): individuals with difficulties understanding written text (n = 22), and individuals with typical reading comprehension (n = 99). The metalinguistic intervention was integrated into an existing literacy course and delivered over seven weeks. The intervention focussed on raising phoneme, morpheme, and orthotactic knowledge amongst the participants in a pre-test / post-test study design. The whole cohort demonstrated significant gains in knowledge in each of the constructs targeted, after just seven hours of teaching integrated into an existing course. Analysis of subgroups of participants demonstrated that individuals with stronger spelling skills responded more favourably to the intervention than their peers with weaker spelling skills. The between-groups differences identified in the subgroups determined by reading comprehension were not as significant as those of the spelling subgroups. Thus, the results suggest the need for differentiated teaching of metalinguistic constructs based on the underlying word-level skills of each individual to ensure that pre-service teachers acquire adequate language structure knowledge within their teacher preparation programme. 

The findings from this thesis refute the assumption that individuals who meet the criteria required to enter into higher education present with strong or adequate literacy skills. The pre-service teachers in the reported studies demonstrated a wide range of literacy ability. The results of this assessment identified spelling, inferencing, and working memory as significant predictors of reading comprehension. The appropriateness of the Simple View of Reading framework for this population was also investigated. Individuals who demonstrated lower reading comprehension showed significant increases in their reading comprehension scores when using a strategy that incorporated highlighting and summarising techniques. This strategy was highly effective across the whole intervention group, in spite of the vast differences in the literacy profiles of these individuals. Findings from a whole-cohort teaching intervention to raise metalinguistic knowledge provide support for the inclusion of differentiated, explicit teaching of these constructs within pre-service teaching programmes. The results reported in this thesis show that by providing targeted intervention to raise the reading comprehension and metalinguistic abilities of pre-service teachers, they become better equipped to provide effective reading instruction for children, and address the disparity in children’s literacy achievement.",,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/10198",,,,"en",,,,,"University of Canterbury.

"10074","10092/806",,,"Jakes, Daniel",,,,,,,,"2014",,,"The use of Complementary and Alternative Medicine (CAM) is now widespread and endeavours are increasingly being made to incorporate CAM into conventional healthcare and move towards Integrative Medicine (IM). To date research has primarily focused on the prevalence of use, and safety and efficacy of CAM; less is known about patients' experiences of and reasons for using specific therapies. While therapeutically diverse, it has been suggested that many CAM modalities share mutually referential ideologies and that people who use them may be motivated to do so by specific health beliefs.
This study focuses on traditional acupuncture in a New Zealand context and investigates users' experiences and perceptions of the therapy, and discusses how personal health beliefs influence usage.
A systematic review of relevant international qualitative research informed the main study, which was carried out using an interpretive phenomenological methodology (Heidegger's approach). Data was gathered from interviews with 12 participants who had recently received treatment from traditionally trained (non-biomedical) acupuncturists. 
Thematic analysis suggested that acupuncture was often sought for health conditions (typically of a chronic and benign nature) that are difficult to treat conventionally. Whereas initial access was primarily motivated by ineffective biomedical treatment, personal health beliefs-particularly subscription to holistic and vitalistic ideologies-often inspired more extensive and ongoing use. The therapeutic encounter was interpreted to contain many elements-other than needling-integral to treatment. Outcomes were perceived to be wide ranging, personal and necessarily subjective, and included the relief of symptoms, increased well-being, and changes to understandings and health behaviours. 
It is concluded that the attraction of acupuncture for patients and many of its perceived benefits lie in therapeutic components that are ultimately embedded in Chinese medicine (holistic) theories of health. A more pluralistic schema for assessing evidence may be necessary to acknowledge treatment outcomes that are meaningful to patients, and to accommodate the divergent ontologies and practice models of acupuncture, other CAMs and biomedicine. Increased interdisciplinary cooperation and communication is suggested as a means to improve patient safety and satisfaction and as a scenario for moving forward with IM.",,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/9156",,,,"en",,,,,"University of Canterbury.

"11433","10092/806",,,,,"Riley, Liz",,,,,,"2014",,,"On a particularly balmy Christchurch evening in March 2012, I attended a parent information evening for my son at his school. As he was embarking on his first year of the National Certificate of Educational Achievement, we were highly attentive. The message was clear, to improve his chances in this highly competitive environment, he would need to work hard to improve academically. This sounded reasonable however, what if he had no idea of what academic improvement means; or what if he knows what it means, but doesn’t know how to go about it. Later, we discussed these concerns with his Dean and were told of the academic mentoring scheme that the school provides. This we were told, would improve his motivation, improve his self esteem and most of all, improve his results. Later that term, my son attended one session of academic mentoring that his school provided. I was curious and asked him to describe his experience. Unfortunately, there was to be only one session. He felt being ‘told what to do’ was not congenial with what he wanted from the programme and the fact that nobody seemed interested in ‘what I already know works’, meant he and the academic mentoring programme parted company. This experience opened up many questions and lead me to consider what does work in successful academic mentoring programmes? Could Solution Focused counselling offer a practical alternative to current practises because of its focus on what is working rather than what is not? The realities of life in a New Zealand high school, mean that teaching, mentoring and counselling needs to be efficient and responsive to the unique challenges of working with adolescents. One such efficient response is Solution Focused Therapy. The philosophy behind this theory is a practical fit with academic mentoring, for three reasons; its focus on solutions rather than problems, its brevity and change can be immediate. Therefore, the subject of this research is academic improvement, specifically, the role that a student’s perception of their own ability plays in contributing to academic improvement. The enquiry falls within a social constructionist’s lens, as the findings rely on the views and voices of participants in terms of how life experiences have developed, enabling perceptions to emerge. The findings from this research portfolio reveal that students’ perceptions on their own academic ability can be enhanced through the use of Solution Focused Therapy. The groups expected to benefit from the findings include; high school students, teachers, counsellors as well as others who are interested in features that influence student success in a high school setting.",,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/10189",,,,"en",,,,,"University of Canterbury.

"11876","10092/806",,,"Algarni, Saleh Saeed",,,,,,,,"2015",,,"Background: Obesity is now one of the most important public health issues in Saudi Arabia, with 74.2% of women and 69% of men found to be overweight or obese, but there is limited research into the nature and effectiveness of overweight and obesity management in primary care in Saudi Arabia or elsewhere. International literature supports the role of primary health care in managing obesity through evidence-based interventions, yet also notes many barriers to health professionals helping patients achieve significant weight loss. A new collaborative and patient-centred approach to primary care management of chronic disease, Fit and Minimally Disruptive Medicine, appears potentially well-suited to helping patients manage their weight.
Research Aims: This thesis aimed to determine health professionals’ and patients’ views on the appropriateness and quality of current obesity management practices in primary health care in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia., and also their views on the acceptability, utility and applicability of Fit and Minimally Disruptive Medicine to assist successful weight management.
Research Methods: Preliminary informal interviews were held with representatives of key groups in primary health care in Riyadh, four senior primary health care officials, 10 primary health care centre managers, 20 doctors, 20 nurses and 20 patients from 10 primary health care centres. The main investigation used the interview material to develop two structured questionnaire surveys for a quantitative cross-sectional descriptive study on the management of overweight and obesity in primary health care. The first questionnaire, for doctors and nurses, addressed primary health care centre resources and services, use of weight loss strategies, and the health professionals’ views on overweight and obese patients, obesity management and the Fit and Minimally Disruptive Medicine approach. The second survey, for patients, addressed patients’ motivation and readiness to lose weight, support from family and friends, weight loss options used, satisfaction with services provided by their primary health care centre, and views on using the Fit and Minimally Disruptive Medicine approach. The surveys were conducted in
iv
53 primary health care centres in four out of five health sectors in Riyadh City; 10 centres were included in a pilot study and 43 in the main study. The main study was conducted with a sample of 77 doctors, 78 nurses and 80 patients.
Results: Findings showed that while primary care practice management of obesity in Riyadh incorporates some best practice recommendations, there are important elements that are rarely, or inconsistently, used. Only 44.2% of doctors and 55.1% of nurses, for example, always calculated patients’ body mass index, and only 10.4% of doctors and 12.8% of nurses always assessed the patient’s progress for more than six months. The main strategy for obesity management was the recommended combination of diet, exercise and behaviour modification (67.5% of doctors and 56.4% of nurses). Reported barriers to establishing obesity clinics included inadequate resources, and administrative and referral issues. The patient survey found 90% of patients said they were ready to lose weight, but identified various barriers, including lack of family and friend support, and dissatisfaction with their primary care centre’s staff and services (48%). The majority of health professionals and patients supported the use of Fit and Minimally Disruptive Medicine weight management.
Discussion: This thesis makes a major contribution to the literature on the effectiveness of primary care management of obesity, notably including the patient perspectives. The thesis is also the first to investigate health professionals’ and patients’ views on applying Fit and Minimally Disruptive Medicine to weight management. Recommendations for Saudi Arabia include further training of health professionals, the introduction of clinical practice guidelines on managing obesity, and a pilot study of using Fit and Minimally Disruptive Medicine for weight management in primary health care. This thesis provides valuable guidance for health care organisations seeking to improve the management of overweight and obesity in primary care, and for researchers interested in undertaking further investigations in this area.",,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/10423",,,,"en",,,,,"University of Canterbury.

"7589","10092/806",,,"Perry, April Lillian",,,,,,,,"2012",,,"Bridges (2004) defines a transition as “a natural process of disorientation or re-orientation” marking the turning points of life (p. 3). One such turning point that has recently attracted the attention of higher education is the shift from university to life-after-study. Some universities, especially in the U.S., have developed programmes and courses to help prepare and support students for this transition. However, most of these educational initiatives have been developed without empirical research that explores graduates’ needs. In this research, therefore, I have sought to understand the experiences and perspectives of recent graduates in the post-university transition with the hope that this may inform potential institutional practices.

Twenty young, recent graduates, who were broadly representative of their (U.S.) university’s student population in terms of degree, gender, and ethnicity, were selected to participate in this research. They engaged in recorded, semi-structured interviews and email interviews over a six-month period. Transcripts of interviews were analysed using typical qualitative procedures informed by interpretivism, symbolic interactionism, naturalistic inquiry, and narrativity. Results indicated that despite individual variability, participants shared some common perspectives. Four main themes emerged from the data. Three illustrated the difficulty of the post-university transition (shifting identities, searching, and unmet expectations), but the fourth illustrated how participants used people and resources (stabilisers) to foster support and balance in their transition. Furthermore, participants offered a range of suggestions about ways their institution might help graduating students better prepare for this transition and life-after-university. Recommendations based on these suggestions provide ideas for career preparation, emotional support, and practical life skills that institutions might choose to implement.",,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/10343",,,,"en",,,,,"University of Canterbury.

"11167","10092/806",,,"Ritchie, Donna Michelle",,,,,,,,"2014",,,"Hegemonic Masculinity informs every aspect of a man’s life regardless of whether they conform to the standards or reject them. Although masculinity informs occupational roles, it can also be seen as an occupation in its own right. Illnesses and injuries can challenge masculine status and result in loss of identity, as well as changing men’s abilities, transforming their occupational roles and providing a challenge to their self-perception of masculinity. There are significant gaps in the literature; particularly regarding the impact health status has on masculine perceptions within a New Zealand context and the idea of masculinity as an occupation. This study goes someway to address these gaps. 
	A qualitative descriptive methodology was employed to understand and describe the stories of 12 men living with the ongoing effects of illness or injury. A general inductive approach to content analysis was undertaken to identify the key themes. The study’s findings show illness and injury and the subsequent changes in occupational roles had a significant impact on participants’ masculine perceptions. Study participants experienced loss in many areas of their lives and described being occupied in recreating and renegotiating their masculinity in varying areas such as work, personal relationships and social activities. 
Further research, conducted within a New Zealand context, will be invaluable in validating the current findings in this area. The application of this knowledge is an area requiring extensive exploration and research. There is significant scope for healthcare professionals to gain understanding of men’s relationship to, and their self-perceptions of, masculinity and to utilise and incorporate these findings into therapeutic settings, therefore gaining more valuable outcomes for their clients.",,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/10200",,,,"en",,,,,"University of Canterbury.

This is particularly relevant, although not exclusively, to teaching practices that meet the needs of Māori students in our bicultural learning environments of New Zealand. There is a growing amount of research to support the use of student voice data, the benefits of which can be seen at a school level, at the classroom teacher level as well as for the individual students themselves.

This research project focused on exploring the impact of students sharing their thoughts and opinions about their learning, (i.e.: student voice data) on influencing teachers’ beliefs about teaching and learning.  In doing so it explores effective facilitation of this process in a bicultural learning environment. In particular it investigates the potential of a combination of specific tools, notably student focus groups and coaching conversations with teachers to influence teachers’ beliefs. 

This study took place in two low decile schools in Christchurch. It involved focus groups of Māori and non-Māori primary-aged students, alongside teacher reflective interviews being conducted on repeated visits. Its findings identified approaches for accessing authentic student voice in a bicultural learning environment. The thoughts and opinions shared by Māori students highlighted a focus on their own learning as well as celebrating their culture. Teachers reacted to student voice by making connections to their classroom programmes, and by accepting or dismissing more provocative statements. These reactions by teachers helped emphasize the most helpful methods for reflecting on this data. Their reflections, used alongside a specially designed ‘Teacher Belief Gathering Tool’, ascertained that teachers’ beliefs were both reaffirmed and changed through guided reflection and coaching conversations on student voice data.

"11136","10092/806",,,"Calvert, John Sinclair",,,,,,,,"2014",,,"This thesis investigates whether luck egalitarianism can provide a cogent and coherent interpretation of educational equality. Historically, the belief that each child should receive an equally good education has exerted a strong influence on policy makers and thus on educational practice, and this despite the vagueness of the egalitarian formula. More recently however, the ideal has been undermined in practice by the rise of neoliberalism and in theory by a number of thinkers advocating other principles of educational justice. But it is vital to be clear about what each child is owed because of the profound effects of education on a person’s life prospects. The motivation for this work is therefore to determine whether educational equality can be rescued as a desirable and animating ideal of educational justice. In order to achieve this, I examine luck egalitarianism, a theory of distributive justice that has its origins in the work of John Rawls, but is now the major rival to his account of egalitarian justice. I probe at the fundamental moral intuitions underpinning luck egalitarianism and how it brings together the morally potent ideas of equality, luck and choice. I argue that these are of relevance for the education each child is owed and I propose a luck egalitarian conception of educational equality, argue that it is a cogent interpretation of egalitarian justice, and conclude that a luck egalitarian conception shows educational equality to be an ideal that is relevant, coherent and what morally matters most for justice in education.
 I describe luck egalitarianism as resting on three basic moral beliefs: that distributive equality is a fundamental demand of justice; that luck undermines fair equality; and that a person’s genuine choices can sometimes, under certain background conditions, render some otherwise objectionable inequalities not unjust. I then examine whether these three beliefs are compatible with each other and what, if anything, links them. Next, I consider luck egalitarianism’s status as a theory of distributive justice and argue that far from this being a weakness, as Elizabeth Anderson (1999) has notably argued, it is a strength of the position. But to appreciate this it needs to be seen that luck egalitarianism makes no claim to being all of justice and that the equalisandum of equality is complex and egalitarianism is intrinsically pluralist in nature (with a particular understanding of what is meant by pluralist). I consider too whether it is a mistake to say that inequalities that are largely due to luck can really be thought of as unjust. Thomas Nagel (1997) has argued that it is merely misfortune, unless the result of deliberate actions or social structures for which someone is responsible. I reject that position and argue that no one has to be responsible for an inequality for it to be unjust.
Having interrogated luck egalitarianism and found it to be a sound account of egalitarian distributive justice, I turn to looking at whether it can illuminate our understanding of educational equality. Educational equality is often interpreted in terms of equality of educational opportunity. I look particularly at a conception of equality of educational opportunity, strongly influenced by Rawls, that has been thoughtfully and carefully articulated by Harry Brighouse and Adam Swift (2008). I find their conception powerful, but flawed, and argue that a luck egalitarian conception can account for the appeal of their conception, but is an advance on it. I end by looking at a specific question of educational justice to test the luck egalitarian conception – is there anything inegalitarian about ability grouping? I conclude that, while still needing to have its implications worked out in full, particularly as regards choice, a luck egalitarian conception provides a compelling account of educational equality and reasserts that equality matters for justice in education.",,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/10438",,,,"en",,,,,"University of Canterbury.

"12065","10092/806",,,,,"Gagliardi, Sarah",,,,,,"2015",,,"The purpose of this qualitative study was to investigate how the emotional wellbeing of female adolescents is influenced by constructions of femininity in a single-sex high school environment. From one single-sex high school, four young women aged 17 and 18 years of age and two teachers were asked to be a part of this study. 

A qualitative approach was used in this study to elicit thick description of participants’ constructions of femininity and emotional wellbeing. Underpinning this research is an interpretivist and social-constructivist methodology, whereby social-constructivist researchers attempt to build understanding of phenomena by accessing the meaning that participants assign to themselves through the experiences they have with the world around them. Qualitative data tools were therefore used, including semi-structured individual interviews and focus groups. 

Analysis of the data involved a qualitative strategy called thematic analysis. This enabled categories and themes to be taken from the data as they emerged. Key themes from this study demonstrated that the school curriculum, teachers, religious expectations, family experiences and peer group pressures directly influenced student feminine gender constructions. Alongside this, peer pressures to be feminine, negative perceptions of self body image, confusion of self and gender-identity, inadequate school health education and negative stigma surrounding mental and emotional health negatively affected student emotional wellbeing.  

From these results, various implications have emerged. First, single-sex schools and its teachers should work to eliminate gendered stereotypes that restrict young women’s interests and opportunities. Second, teachers and schools need to be aware of female peer dynamics and seek ways to facilitate healthy relationships and identity development of its students. Further, health education personnel should factor in female peer group dynamics when implementing emotional wellbeing programmes, curriculum and policy initiatives aimed at female adolescents. Finally, students need realistic and relevant health education that supports understandings and coping strategies for self-esteem, identity confusion and perceptions of body image. Health education also needs to promote a positive view of mental and emotional health and encourage the use of the school’s mental health service.",,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/10521",,,,"en",,,,,"University of Canterbury.

"12339","10092/806",,,"Harasymchuk, Brad",,,,,,,,"2015",,,"This international research set out to exemplify the pedagogical practices of 11 teachers from Christchurch/Ōtautahi, New Zealand (Aotearoa) and Saskatoon, Canada. It explores their resistance to the various colonial and neocolonizing constructs central to contemporary mainstream schooling in both cities (due to forces such as neoliberalism). These acts of resistance were the result of contesting ideologies of time, space, curriculum and assessment. The research, therefore, describes some of the pedagogical practises of these teachers. It also considers their narratives about their usage of place-based education (PBE) approaches and their commitment to the adoption of critical pedagogies of place (CPP) to meet the real needs of their students (both Indigenous and non-Indigenous).

An interpretive paradigm was employed within a qualitative framework to underpin this research. A case study approach was also adopted and informed by a bricolage methodological framework. Primary and secondary data were collected from a number of storage sites (libraries) in both countries and through a questionnaire, interview and observation of each teacher’s classroom space. The data was analysed by coding key information while drawing out any recurring themes and points of difference.

The findings reveal that certain aspects of PBE and CPP are accessible to teachers despite their feelings of being confined in terms of their ability to use time, space, curriculum and assessment within their traditional school institutions. Although their abilities to engage with PBE and CPP were limited, those teachers that had more control over time, space, curriculum and assessment were able to dive deeper into PBE and especially CPP.

A key finding of this research was the extent of awareness and engagement that the teachers had in transforming controlled, static, spaces found in the classrooms, communities and natural environments into meaningful places with students. This finding also suggests that teachers with more control over time, space, curriculum and assessment have an easier time in creating this change.

The findings also indicate that these teachers first needed to have the courage to challenge traditional systems of schooling, because teachers can become marginalized by other teachers and administrators when seen to be attempting to transform entrenched institutional (schooling) cultures. Flexibility and trust were two of the other recurring themes that emerged from the data collected. Teachers possessing more flexibility (with regards to time, space, curriculum and assessment design procedures) were most able to enact PBE and CPP. They were also the best-positioned participants to create meaningful professional relationships with their students and local community members. Issues of trust were clearly evident in recurring discussions around the increased amount of trust teachers needed to have with students for the students to be able to engage with space and place. There was also an increased amount of trust that school administrators (principals) needed to have in their teachers who were engaging with PBE and CPP.

The research participants in this study demonstrated that, in different ways, they were striving to resist the ideologies underpinning traditional mainstream schooling, and that they were able to enact change regardless of the challenges they experienced. Their perseverance to ground their teaching in PBE and CPP approaches testifies to their love of education and their acceptance of it as a legitimate process for change and growth.",,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/10662",,,,"en",,,,,"University of Canterbury.

"11943","10092/806",,,"Guerin, Annette Patricia",,,,,,,,"2015",,,"New Zealand education policies and documents (Ministry of Education, 2007, 2009, 2010, 2011a, 2014a) situate students at the centre of assessment processes that are underpinned by the New Zealand Curriculum. They identify building student assessment capability as crucial to achieving improvement in learning. Documents recognize the impact of quality interactions and relationships on effective assessment. However these core beliefs about assessment are not observed to guide teaching practices for all students. Disabled students remain invisible in assessment data and practices within New Zealand secondary schools. There appears to be little or no assessment data about learning outcomes for this group of students. This thesis investigates possible ways to recognize the diversity of student capability and learning through the use of narrative assessment. It challenges the absence of disabled students in assessment landscapes as educator roles and responsibilities within assessment, teaching and learning are framed within an inclusive pedagogy. 

This research project focuses on how a team of adults and two students labeled as disabled make sense of assessment and learning within the context of narrative assessment in the students’ regular high school. The project examines the consequences of narrative assessment on student identity, wellbeing and participation within learning. The study offers opportunities to observe how specialists from outside of the school respond to the use of narrative as they work with the two student research participants. 

This study undertakes a critical inquiry that recognises the principles of the Treaty of Waitangi – partnership, protection and participation – as  pivotal to inclusive practice where all students are valued as learners. It investigates how narrative assessment can honour these principles in everyday teaching practice. 

The project aims to inform education policy and practice, with a view to enriching learning outcomes and opportunities for disabled students who are frequently marginalized by inequitable assessment processes.

It is argued that narrative assessment can support the construction of student identity and wellbeing. It can support the recognition of disabled students as partners in their learning. However the value of narrative assessment can be undermined by the responses of educators and other professionals who continue to work within deficit models of assessment, teaching and learning. 

Within this thesis adult participants from family and education contexts have clear ideas about the value and validity of assessment practices and processes that do not respect a presumption of competence or a need to establish a relationship with a student being assessed. Their views challenge everyday practices that fulfill assessment contracts, but ignore Treaty of Waitangi and New Zealand Curriculum commitments. Their views can inform better ways of working between specialists and schools supporting disabled students.",,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/10486",,,,"en",,,,,"University of Canterbury.

"12239","10092/806",,,"Jones, Kay-Lee Emma",,,,,,,,"2015",,,"Māori education has grown out of a long and varied history of Māori engagement with Western forms of schooling. Full immersion Māori learning environments such as kura kaupapa Māori emerged from a background of colonial Mission schools, Native Schools, and evolving assimilation and integration educational policies. It is the subsequent loss of language, continual Māori school underachievement and Māori struggles for indigenous self-determination that have provided the conditions in which the development of Kaupapa Māori otherwise known as Māori medium education has taken place. Māori medium education has emerged in varying forms and differing levels of Māori language immersion, although the principles and philosophies of these environments remain particularly Māori orientated. Kaupapa Māori education is largely built upon whānau aspirations and is set within a Māori framework of learning and Māori language teaching. 

In addition to full immersion Māori schools there are other classroom settings that offer varied levels of Māori language instruction. Some of these classrooms have been established in English medium schools, creating a bilingual context. While full immersion schools focus on the breadth of all things Māori, bilingual schools may have a slightly different focus. May, Hill and Tiakiwai (2006 p.1) in their review of Bilingual Education in Aotearoa explain it as an area of instruction where school subjects are taught in two languages (Māori and English) and students become fluent orators and writers in both.

Little is understood about the dynamics of partial immersion programmes and the contribution these settings make to Māori language and cultural knowledge acquisition and to wider self-determination aspirations of Māori. Drawing from the contributed insights of teaching staff, whānau and other stakeholders linked to partial immersion education, this research considers these settings to better understand the relationship between language acquisition and cultural knowledge attainment. A synergy of Kaupapa Māori theory with a qualitative interpretivist approach has guided the research process. The rationale for the research was to strengthen cultural knowledge and cultural aspirations which made it appropriate to use Kaupapa Māori principles as a foundation of which to develop the research. As research is currently limited in this respect a more extensive understanding of the teaching and learning programmes within a partial immersion classroom may be paramount to their continuation and success.

Key findings emerged from the participant interviews and clear characteristics of these environments developed: Whānau (family), te reo Māori me ōna tikanga (Māori language and cultural customs) Māori values, and Māori pedagogies. The participants talked about many features particular to partial immersion education that linked to these four themes. The themes were further analysed to find key positive outcomes of these settings. A strong sense of pride in identity, particularly Māori identity and Māori succeeding as Māori were the two key positive outcomes that emerged from the participant data.",,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/10589",,,,"en",,,,,"University of Canterbury.

Using a survey developed from the Quality of Life Instrument for People with Developmental Disabilities – Short Version (QOL-PDD-SV) (Brown, Raphael & Renwick, 1997) and The World Health Organisation Quality of Life - (WHOQOL)-BREF, parents or caregivers were asked to identify what level of importance and satisfaction their child or adolescent placed on areas of QOL including physical health, psychological health - stress levels and coping ability, attachment to their neighbourhood, friends, family, leisure activities, community access and schooling. They were also asked to determine what level of impact the earthquakes had had on each area of their child or adolescent’s life and overall quality of life in the aftermath of the earthquakes. A total of 31 parents of 22 males and 9 females between the ages of 2.5 years to 19 years of age (mean age: 12.6 years) responded. The results were collated and analysis was run to measure for the effect of age, gender and geographical location. The results found that the earthquakes affected nearly every area of QOL for the children and adolescents.

"12827","10092/806",,,,"De Vocht, Lia",,,,,,,"2015",,,"This thesis argues that a Bakhtinian dialogic approach holds possibilities for reconceptualising and re-enacting teacher–child dialogue interactions in early years education. It accepts education as open-ended, with children as active participants and frames teacher–child dialogues as unique encounters, which can go beyond children’s neoliberal enculturation in the world. Neoliberal discourses have exerted an important influence on early years education, emphasising universal “best evidence” strategies and narrowly defined learning “outcomes” which can lead to technicist approaches to teaching and learning.
The study explores the dialogic interactions between children aged from 3½ to 5 years and their teachers in two early childhood settings. In a dialogic methodological approach, two of the teachers and myself as a researcher critically engaged in collaborative discussions of selected video recordings of the teacher–child interactions. 
A Bakhtinian concept of moral answerability applies to the collaborative dialogic approach between teachers and researcher. It goes beyond teaching as a technical approach with universal strategies, to provide guidance for teachers in the unique lived experiences with their students. A dialogic reflexivity, which is employed both pedagogically and as a methodological approach in the study, is aligned with Bakhtin’s philosophy of praxis in everyday life experiences. A second Bakhtinian notion of polyphony explains how each person accesses multiple voices in response, which are shaped simultaneously by unique previous experiences and the encounter itself. In educational dialogue, polyphony can open up a view of dialogue as open-ended and providing different possibilities; it can allow for more meaningful responses by students and more respectful listening from teachers. Furthermore, young children’s carnivalesque utterances are viewed as challenging authoritative, monologic discourses when analysed through a Bakhtinian lens. For Bakhtin, subjectivity is not only shaped in and through dialogue; it also in turn shapes present and future dialogue. Dialogue is therefore inevitably intertwined with subjectivity. 
Findings show that teaching in early childhood settings involves a complex mix of both monologic and dialogic acts. Dialogic processes can provide alternative understandings of children and teachers as agentic and unfinalised. At times, children were engaged in carnivalesque acts, resisting authoritative teaching through their play, chanting and non-verbal communication, thereby making visible the institutionalisation of children and teachers in early childhood settings. It is suggested that children who are active participants in their education need to be given opportunities for carnivalesque responses. Furthermore, when early childhood teachers have opportunities to critically reflect on children’s utterances in a collaborative dialogue with colleagues, they can gain a more complex understanding of teacher–child dialogue, enabling them to answer morally to the children in their care. Ongoing dialogic encounters with the teachers provided multiple perspectives of the data, resulting in changes to their teaching practices and routines. The findings of the study hold important implications for teaching and for in-service and pre-service teacher education. I suggest that respectful dialogic approaches between teachers and researchers hold pedagogical and methodological potential and, when used thoughtfully, can counteract neoliberal, technicist interventions. In relation to both pre-service and in-service teacher education, the study speaks to the importance of teachers being equipped to engage in open-ended dialogue with children and collaborative dialogues with peers. Drawing on Bakhtin’s concept of moral answerability, this thesis is an utterance asking for an active response not only in everyday teacher-child dialogues, but also in the ongoing, open-ended dialogue about early childhood education and, in particular, teacher–child dialogue. It leaves unfinalised not only children and adults, but also the subject of teacher- child dialogue. There is no first utterance and no last word; Bakhtinian dialogue views both children and adults as becoming.",,,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/10936",,,"en",,,,,"University of Canterbury.

"5560","10092/806",,,"Veerasamy, Arthi",,,,,,,,"2010",,,"Aim: The aim of this project was to find the level of oral health literacy of parents of preschool
age children regarding their child’s oral health. The primary objective was to improve
the oral health status of preschoolers and to prevent early childhood caries.
Methods: 117 participants (parents of preschoolers) completed a self-administered oral health
literacy questionnaire. Data obtained from the study was analysed using a statistical package
(SPSS). Firstly, descriptive analysis was undertaken generating tables and graphs of sociodemographic
variables. Later, associations between oral health literacy and sociodemographic
variables were identified and also relation between parents’ oral health literacy
and their attitude towards water fluoridation in Christchurch was identified using bivariate
and multivariate analysis. Psychometric analysis was generated to test validity and reliability
of the oral health literacy questionnaire.
Results: In the total sample, 38% of participants had poor oral health literacy regarding their
child’s oral health. The results also indicated that there were associations present between
parents’ oral health literacy and socio-demographic variables such as ethnicity, education and
family income. Nearly half of the parents opted for water fluoridation in Christchurch. A
strong association between parents’ oral health literacy and their attitude towards water
fluoridation was identified. In the total sample, 40% of parents were not aware of need for
first dental visit before the school age. Reliability was good for the developed oral health
literacy instrument.
Conclusions: This study of parents’ oral health literacy in Christchurch, New Zealand
identified association of oral health literacy and socio-demographic variables which gives
future guidance to improving oral health status of New Zealand children. The relation

between parents’ oral health literacy and their attitude towards water fluoridation was shown
in this study. This result might be used in future water fluoridation surveys. Future studies are
needed to examine health care provider’s perspective in improving parents’ oral health

"12467","10092/806",,,"Veerasamy, Arthi",,,,,,,,"2015",,,"Introduction: The literature review indicated that oral health is a serious health issue among Indian school adolescents. In India, less than 5% of adolescents have access to organised public dental health services in order to identify and treat dental caries at an early stage. Oral health literacy is important for adolescents to prevent and manage dental caries in their permanent teeth. Currently, there is no formal oral health education available in both the primary and secondary level school curriculum in Tamil Nadu. 
Objective: This thesis was conducted to collect baseline data to measure the epidemiology of dental caries and the level of oral health literacy among adolescents in rural and urban schools of Tamil Nadu, India. 
Methods: Oral health literacy and the epidemiology of dental caries were measured in 974 adolescent school students (12-15 year-olds) from both rural and urban areas of Tamil Nadu, India. There were three research questions answered in this thesis using a cross-sectional descriptive correlational quantitative study design. The first research question was addressed by measuring the Decayed, Missing and Filled teeth index (DMFT) using the WHO oral health survey method. The second research question was addressed by measuring the oral health literacy of 974 adolescent participants using a self-administered questionnaire developed for this study. The third research question was addressed by examining the association between the severity of dental caries (question 1) and oral health literacy (question 2). 
Results: The oral health survey indicated that prevalence of dental caries among adolescents in rural and urban parts of Tamil Nadu was 61.4% with an average DMFT score of 2.03. Multiple regression analyses indicated factors such as gender, age, mother’s education, type of schools and community/caste as significant predictors of dental caries. This is the first study to assess the impact of community on oral health literacy and status of adolescents.
Almost 92% of participants reported that they had never been to a dentist. In total, 1980 teeth were affected and 98.6% (1953) affected teeth were decayed and not filled. 
The Cronbach’s alpha score (0.651) demonstrated the developed questionnaire had good internal consistency. In total, 35% of participants had poor oral health literacy (OHL) skills and only 8.3% of participants had good OHL skills to prevent dental caries. Parent’s education, gender and community/caste were identified as significant predictors of OHL in the regression analysis. A strong negative association between oral health literacy scores and dental caries prevalence and severity was identified in the study. 
Conclusion: The current study is the first to find an association between oral health literacy and dental caries in an adolescent population both in international and Indian literature. The prevalence of dental caries was decreased and severity of dental caries was increased when compared to previous research in Tamil Nadu. This result implies an imbalance in availability of oral health services in Tamil Nadu, India. The study results also imply that the majority of the study population had poor or moderate oral health literacy to prevent and manage dental caries. 
Females, Scheduled Caste and Tribes attending public schools in rural areas were identified as the more vulnerable populations to get affected by dental caries due to their poor oral health literacy. Oral health policies should be targeted to these adolescent populations in the Tamil Nadu region.

The original intention for the Partnership Community Worker (PCW) project in 2006 was for it to be an extension of the Pegasus Health General Practice and furthermore to be a bridge between the community and primary healthcare. It was believed that a close working relationship between the Practice Nurse and the PCW would help the target population of Māori, Pacifica and low income people to address and overcome their perceived barriers to healthcare which included: finance, transport, anxiety, cultural issues, communication, or lack of knowledge.
Seven years later although the PCW project has been deemed a success in the Canterbury District Health Board annual reports (2013-14) and community and government agencies, including the Christchurch Resettlement Service (2012), many of the Pegasus Health General Practices have not utilised the project to its full extent, hence the need for this research.
I was interested in finding out in the first instance if the model had changed and, if so why, and in the second instance if the promotional material currently distributed by Pegasus Health Primary Health Organisation reflected the daily practice of the PCW. A combination of methods were used including: surveys to the Pegasus Health General Practices, interviews with PCWs, interviews with managers of  both the PCW host organisations and  referring agencies to the PCW project. All the questions asked of all the participants in this research were focussed on their own perception of the role of the PCW. 
Results showed that the model has changed and although the publications were not reflecting the original intention of the project they did reflect the daily practice of the PCWs who are now struggling to meet much wider community expectations and needs. 
Key Results:
Partnership Community Worker (PCW) interviews: Seventeen PCWs of the 19 employed were interviewed face to face. A number expressed interest in more culturally specific training and some are pursuing qualifications in social work; for many pay parity is an issue. In addition, many felt overwhelmed by the expectations around clients with mental health issues and housing issues now, post-earthquakes.
Medical Practice surveys: Surveys were sent to eighty-two Pegasus Health medical practices and of these twenty five were completed. Results showed the full capacity of the PCW role was not clearly understood by all with many believing it was mostly a transport service. Those who did understand the full complexity of the role were very satisfied with the outcomes.
PCW Host Community Manager Interviews: Of the ten out of twelve managers interviewed, some wished for more communication with Pegasus Health management because they felt aspects of both the PCW role and their own role as managers had become blurred over time.
Referring organisations: Fifteen of the fifty referring community or government organisations participated. The overall satisfaction of the service was high and some acknowledged the continuing need for PCWs to be placed in communities where they were well known and trusted.
Moreover results also showed that both the Canterbury earthquakes 2010-2011 and the amalgamation of Partnership Health PHO and Pegasus Health Charitable Limited in 2013 have contributed to the change of the model. Further future research may also be needed to examine the long term effects on the people of Canterbury involved in community work during the 2011-2014 years.

"3917","10092/806",,,"Farquhar, Sarah-Eve",,,,,,,,"1988",,,"New Zealand childcare centres have recently been included in
the education system. Little information is available about the
actual functions of childcare and no comprehensive assessments of
quality levels have been carried out.
A randomly selected sample of eight Canterbury centres
representative of three organizational variables (ownership,
hours, group-size) were studied. An ecological approach was used
to examine the interrelationships between programme functioning,
adults' beliefs, and participants' experiences. The study was
designed to provide formative information on these programmes.
The basic operational characteristics of the centres and the
characteristics of the children, workers' and parents' were
examined. Five main categories of programme functioning were
generated from the data and analyzed in relation to their effect
on participants' experiences. These programme dimensions were:
space) time, activities, patterns of interaction, and beliefs.
Programme quality was examined using three perspectives. The
parents' perspective of programme quality was investigated in
relation to their role as childcare consumers and/or programme
participants. The workers' perspective of programme quality was
investigated in relation to their experiences and stress levels
associated with their roles and programme functioning. The
environmental quality of programmes was investigated, and quality
ratings given to 37 key items of quality programmes to enhance
child development (Early Childhood Environment Rating Scale:
Harms & Clifford, 1980). Quality item scores on the ECERS were
correlated with mean total centre scores to identify items that
were predictive of centre quality level. In addition, quality scores were correlated with the tllree organizational variables to
test whether differences in centre organization were related to
programme quality. ECERS profiles on centre quality provided a
useful tool for the formative assessment of programme quality.
Results indicated the complexity of factors that comprised
childcare programmes. There were as many differences between
types of centres as there were within types of centres. Two
examples are that: some full-day centres were similar to partday
centres because they were organized to cater mainly for
children on a casual rather than on a full-time basis; two
private centres had the highest and the lowest quality ratings on
the ECERS.
The functioning of programmes along the different dimensions
had many important effects on participants' experiences. For
example, in relation to analysis of space, purpose-built centres
had fewer provisions for privacy than centres housed in converted
homes. When combined these programme dimensions conceptualized
the nature of participants' experience. Programmes provided more
than just custodial core for children but were not designed nor
sufficiently equipped to be educational.
The data indicate a need for more extensive research on
children's learning within the childcare context, to identify the
extent to which patterns of programme organization and the
traditional model of education, have constrained quality levels.
The methodological approach taken in this study including
multiple methods, triangulation of data sources, reflexivity and
a feminist framework; was critical in efforts to capture the
richness and complexity of childcare. The methodology of this
study could provide a useful model for further early childhood
centre study.",,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/3493",,,,"en",,,,,"University of Canterbury.

"12881","10092/806",,,,"Obaid, Balsam",,,,,,,"2015",,,"Poorly controlled diabetes is common among the majority of youth with type 1 diabetes and can lead to adverse health outcomes at an early age. There is a need to change this to minimise the risk of negative long-term consequences. The onset of complications from diabetes can be prevented or delayed with good management as demonstrated by blood glucose being kept close to or within the normal range. Diabetes control is challenging for young people due to a combination of physiological and psychological factors.

Diabetes control needs to be monitored both at an individual level and also at a population level, in order to optimise health outcomes and provide important information for health service provision. There are gaps in knowledge relating to the current level of diabetes control at a population level and of the epidemiological characteristics of youth with type 1 diabetes in the Canterbury region in New Zealand. There has been no research of this nature in the Canterbury region since 2003. There are also gaps in knowledge and a lack of national and international research that investigates psychosocial characteristics of youth with type 1 diabetes and the impact these may have on diabetes control. There is a potentially promising intervention, namely, Motivational Interviewing (MI), that although previous research investigating it with diabetes has shown some promise, methodological problems have limited the conclusions that can be drawn. This thesis, within the New Zealand context, addresses some of these gaps and adds to the body of knowledge of research concerning diabetes control and youth with type 1 diabetes, and investigates MI intervention for youth with poorly controlled diabetes.

The thesis encompasses three studies. The first study is an audit that provides up-to-date information on epidemiological characteristics and clinical outcomes for the youth population with type 1 diabetes residing in the Canterbury region. The second study is a cross-sectional study that investigates the relationship between glycaemic control and key psychosocial characteristics: illness beliefs, self-efficacy, and quality of life in youth with type 1 diabetes in Canterbury. The third study is a longitudinal study that investigates the efficacy of MI as an intervention for youth with poorly controlled type 1 diabetes, and explores its impact on diabetes outcomes using statistical and clinical analyses.

The first study showed that from 2003 to 2010 the prevalence of adolescents and young adults with type 1 diabetes in Canterbury has increased; there is therefore an increased demand on health resources. In addition, in 2010 glycaemic control at a population level was in the poorly controlled diabetes range and this had remained unchanged since 2003. This suggests the need for more intensive interventions. The second study found that poor diabetes control in youth with type 1 diabetes is influenced by a number of factors, including negative views on diabetes, lower perceived personal control, higher diabetes-related concerns, and lower levels of worry about complications. These findings provide a new understanding of the importance of balancing worries about diabetes complications and the perception of diabetes as a threatening condition. The third study showed that the MI intervention was generally successful in improving diabetes outcomes – clinical, psychosocial, and behavioural changes were observed. Statistically and clinically significant positive changes were found across multiple variables: glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c), glycaemic variability, adherence, and psychosocial functioning.

Taken together, the findings of the three studies indicate that majority of youth with type 1 diabetes in the Canterbury region had poor glycaemic control, which suggests that additional interventions may be required to improve management of their condition, especially interventions targeting psychosocial functioning (e.g., illness perceptions) and diabetes self-management. Motivational Interviewing may be a viable option, and therefore further research into this approach is recommended.",,,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/11078",,,"en",,,,,"University of Canterbury.

"12628","10092/806",,,"North, Christopher John",,,,,,,,"2015",,,"As a teacher educator, I was concerned at the passive roles that pre-service teachers (PSTs) seemed to take in my outdoor education (OE) courses and I believed that more authentic (teacher-like) experiences would assist PSTs to take more active roles. Early in this research I developed a metaphor of PSTs as passengers on the long distance flight (their degree) to the destination (of teaching) to explain some of this passivity.
Using a self-study methodology, I examined a variety of ‘authentic’ learning experiences during a semester-long course. Guided by Schwab’s commonplaces, I accessed perspectives of learners, milieu, teacher educator and discipline to provide me with some certainty about the effects of my teaching.
The authentic learning experiences included my use of transparent teaching (open journaling and thinking aloud), modelling of proposed graduating teacher standards, fatality case studies and handing over control on an OE camp. As the research progressed, it became apparent that my initial framing of the problem of PST passivity was flawed. In particular, the most authentic experiences of teaching on the OE camp did not necessarily result in the active learning I had anticipated.
Through the self-study methodology, I came to realise that authenticity was impeding the learning of some students. I reframed my approach to teacher education and used Schwab’s eclecticism to also acknowledge the equal importance of passive learning, inauthenticity and teacher uncertainty. I argue that this eclectic approach provides a more nuanced and fuller understanding of teaching and learning in the OE course. Finally, I discuss the criteria within self-study for demonstrating improvement and representation of results.",,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/10926",,,,"en",,,,,"University of Canterbury.

"12557","10092/806",,,"Mackinven, Kathryn",,,,,,,,"2015",,,"Blended learning has been suggested as having the potential to transform tertiary education through its ability to provide flexible learning options, cost reductions and high quality educational experiences. Combining the benefits of both the face-to-face and online learning environments, blended learning provides opportunities for tertiary education organisations to improve the engagement, satisfaction and achievement of students. Tertiary science is experiencing issues with student recruitment and retention due to it being complex and challenging to learn and often poorly taught. Blended learning, therefore, with its ability to support visualisation of abstract scientific processes, critical thinking and attitudes to science could provide a means to encourage students to study science. However, to date, most studies on blended learning in undergraduate science have focused on evaluating the implementation of a particular blended approach within a small number of science classes or have considered only the teacher or student perspective. This study sought to explore both lecturer and student experiences of blended learning within undergraduate science whilst also considering the institutional context within which science teaching and learning operates.
A case study methodology was used to investigate blended learning in undergraduate science in a New Zealand university. Data collection methods included interviews with university management, lecturers and students. Management interviews were used to determine the university’s stage of blended learning adoption and to provide the institutional context for the study. Lecturer and student interviews provided a rich description of each group’s experiences and perspectives of blended learning in science. These were supplemented with lecturer and student surveys which provided breadth to the findings.
The findings revealed both the institutional and disciplinary context influence lecturer and student perspectives of blended learning. They also highlighted the similarities between lecturer and student experiences. Lecturer perspectives and issues have long been taken into consideration by tertiary organisations when planning their blended learning implementation. However, this study suggested that student needs and support are equally as important and recommended that they receive the same attention.",,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/10861",,,,"en",,,,,"University of Canterbury.

"10675","10092/806",,,"Ferguson, Graeme William",,,,,,,,"2014",,,"Increasingly since the 1990s those of us who are interested in gender issues in education have heard the question: What about the boys? A discourse has emerged in New Zealand, as in other countries including Australia, Canada, the United States and the United Kingdom, that attention spent on addressing issues related to the educational needs of girls has resulted in the neglect of boys and problems related to their schooling. Positioned within this discourse, boys are depicted as disadvantaged, victims of feminism, underachieving or failing within the alienating feminised schooling environment and their struggles at school are seen as a symptom of a wider ‘crisis of masculinity'. This anxiety about boys has generated much debate and a number of explanations for the school performance of boys. One concern, that has remained largely unexamined in the Aotearoa New Zealand context, is that the dominant discourse of masculinity is characterised by a restless physicality, anti-intellectualism, misbehaviour and opposition to authority all of which are construed as antithetical to success at school. This thesis explores how masculinities are played out in the schooling experiences of a small group of 5, 6 and 7 year old boys in two New Zealand primary schools as they construct, embody and enact their gendered subjectivities both as boys and as pupils.
This study of how the lived realities of schooling for these boys are discursively constituted is informed by feminist poststructuralism, aspects of queer theory and, in particular, draws on the works of Michel Foucault. The research design involved employing an innovative mix of data generating strategies. The discursive analysis of the data generated in focus group discussions, classroom and playground observations, children’s drawings and video and audio recording of the normal classroom literacy programmes is initially organised around these sites of learning in order to explore how gender is produced discursively, embodied and enacted as children go about their work and their play.
The research shows that although considerable diversity was apparent as the boys fashioned their masculinities in these different sites, ‘doing boy’ is not inimical to ‘doing schoolboy’ as all the boys, when required to, were able to constitute themselves as ‘intelligible’ pupils (Youdell, 2006). The research findings challenge the notion of school as a feminised and alienating environment for them. In particular, instances of some of the boys disrupting the established classroom norms, as recorded by feminist researchers more than two decades ago, are documented. Concerns then, that “classroom practices reinforced a notion of male importance and superiority while diminishing the interests and status of girls” (Allen, 2009, p. 124) appear to still be relevant, and the postfeminist discourse “that gender equity has now been achieved for girls and women in education” (Ringrose, 2013, p. 1) is called into question. Amid the greater emphasis on measuring easily quantifiable aspects of pupils’ educational achievement, what this analysis does is to recognize the processes of schooling as highly complex and to offer a more nuanced response to the question of boys and their schooling than that offered by, for example, men’s rights advocates. It suggests that if we are committed to improving education for all children, the question needs to be re/framed so as not to lose sight of educational issues related to girls and needs to ask just which particular groups of boys and which particular groups of girls are currently being disadvantaged in our schools.",,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/9650",,,,"en",,,,,"University of Canterbury.

"10788","10092/806",,,"Tran, Bao Cao",,,,,,,,"2014",,,"This case study examines the attitudes of Jarainese people (an indigenous group in Gia Lai province of Vietnam) towards bilingual education related to bilingualism, the maintenance of the native language, its use in their own communities, and its perceived importance within formal schooling. The research employed a combination of quantitative and qualitative methods by which the data were collected. Quantitative data were obtained via 345 questionnaires administered to Jarainese students (N=173) and their grandparents and parents (N=172). Qualitative data were obtained via individual interviews of 13 parents and 5 focus group interviews with students. The qualitative data analyses were reported in three narratives as examples of the views of parents, and as thematic interpretations of the student focus groups.
The findings reported in this thesis revealed the high degree of ethnic and cultural identity reported through the attitudes of the Jarainese people towards the use of the mother tongue and its maintenance. Jarainese people use their mother tongue to consolidate their ethnic and cultural identity and solidarity. However, the results revealed that Jarainese children tend to use more Vietnamese in their daily life whereas their parents and grandparents retain their oral native language. Additionally, there was a low level of self-reported literacy in Jarainese across the individuals surveyed.
The findings disclosed that both languages are seen as important by the Jarainese people. They indicate that Jarainese people do not reject Vietnamese, because it is considered as a language of educational, social and economic advantages and advancement; however, they show the desire of the Jarainese people to affirm their cultural identity by retaining their native language. Despite this desire, the results demonstrated how impacts from the social milieu such as mass media, education and national dominance of Vietnamese hinder the maintenance of Jarainese.
The findings confirm the results of other research in the field concerning the benefits and challenges of promoting bilingual development and preserving the native language. The results also confirm a link between demographic dimensions such as level of education, occupation, and living areas, and language attitudes. Furthermore, parents’ attitudes seem to influence their children’s perspectives toward bilingualism.
In conclusion, this case study provides further evidence for the importance of values and knowledge related to bilingualism, as well as the need for bilingual development. This evidence is taken from a relatively unique context of the study: i.e., the communist context of Vietnam and under-studied indigenous minority groups in this area of the world. Hence, implications of the findings for bilingual education and regional language policy consideration are discussed. It recommends that the Vietnamese Government and education sector should pay greater attention to, and provide more support for, Jarainese people’s struggles to provide Jarainese children with minority language education. In addition, it is important to specify that a bilingual education program and a regional language policy should be considered and implemented in order to create environments in which Jarainese – Vietnamese bilingual children can develop and promote their bilingual proficiency and knowledge of bilingualism.",,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/9708",,,,"en",,,,,"University of Canterbury.
