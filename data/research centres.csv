known as CCAMLR, is the governing body established as part of the Antarctic
treaty system to regulate fisheries in the Southern Ocean. Due to concern about
the exploitation of Antarctic krill (Euphasia superba), a key prey item in the
Antarctic marine food web, the CCAMLR Ecosystem Monitoring Programme
(CEMP) aims to account for the needs of predator species when setting
conservation measures such as catch limits. This precautionary approach is
integral to the conservation objectives of CCAMLR and the rational use of marine
resources. Predator parameters and environmental conditions are monitored as
they are likely to be important for both predator and prey species. In the krill
fishery, a krill yield model allows for krill escapement and trigger levels are set
to protect dependent predators and minimize ecosystem effects. The scale of
management units should be taken into account for a better understanding of
the effects of harvesting and allow for faster management response. Future
challenges such as climate change could further complicate the ecosystem based
approach, but may be anticipated by the precautionary management of CCAMLR
and the ecosystem monitoring programme.",,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/13844",,"en","English",,"University of Canterbury",,"All Rights Reserved",,,,,"Fisheries Management and Ecosystem Monitoring in the Southern Ocean",,"Electronic Thesis or Dissertation","Science","University of Canterbury","Postgraduate Certificate","Postgraduate Certificate in Antarctic Studies","College of Science, University of Canterbury","ucresearchrepository@canterbury.ac.nz",,

"16918","10092/13758",,"Dobson, Wills",,,"2014","Despite the extreme conditions of inland terrestrial Antarctica, life still manages to
survive in microbial form.
Exploring and understanding how it exists has important implications in understanding
evolutionary processes, modelling early earth life and astrobiology.
The most extreme environments that harbour microbial life in continental Antarctica
are the Dry Valleys of the Transantarctic Mountains and the protruding Nunataks of the
Ice sheet expanse. Conditions in these environments are harsh, with water in low
supply, extreme temperature variation and either too much or too little sunlight.
Life exists in a variety of shapes and forms. Nematodes and Tardigrades are some of the
hardiest micro fauna known, able to survive total desiccation and freezing. Mosses,
Algae and Lichen make up the photosynthesis capable organisms and can survive in a
wide variety of environments.
These organisms strive against the odds and form habitats not just in soil or on rock
surfaces, but also under or within the rock. This helps to manage their moisture supply,
and protect from harmful exterior forces such as extreme temperature variations and
UV radiation.
The major limiting forces for microbial life in terrestrial continental Antarctica are
varied. Unsurprisingly water availability is the most important as it controls all
organisms ability to live and grow. Temperature is also important due to its effect on the
freezing point of water and controls on photosynthesis. Light plays a major part as it
helps control the growth of the photosynthetic organisms as well as varies the
temperature. Surface type is also important due to the slow growth rates in Antarctica,
coupled with the environments required in which to survive.",,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/13863",,"en","English",,"University of Canterbury",,"All Rights Reserved",,,,,"What are the limiting survival factors of microbial life in continental terrestrial Antarctica?",,"Electronic Thesis or Dissertation","Science","University of Canterbury","Postgraduate Certificate","Postgraduate Certificate in Antarctic Studies","College of Science, University of Canterbury","ucresearchrepository@canterbury.ac.nz",,

Vegetation of terrestrial Antarctica is restricted to regions free of ice, which make up only
0.3 percent of the continent. Antarctic plants live at the physiological limits of survival. Land
plants are mostly confined to the cryptogams: mosses dominate the ice-free land and can
form complex communities in areas that receive adequate summer meltwater. Intrinsically,
Antarctic mosses represent unique diminutive communities at the limits of survival,
ecologically they provide habitat for invertebrates, and globally they can be seen as
sentinels for global environmental change. There is evidence for rapid environmental
change already occurring on the Antarctic continent: the Peninsula is one of the fastest
warming regions on the planet, East Antarctica is undergoing warming and drying, and the
entire continent is subject to high UV-B levels as a result of ozone depletion. Already at the
limits of survival, Antarctic mosses are likely to be particularly sensitive environmental
change. Indirect effects of climate change such as water relations will probably have a
greater impact than rising temperatures alone. Mosses may benefit from the short term
reduction in stress that follows warmer temperatures. However the long term effect is more
complex, particularly combined with competition from invasive species interactions.
Community level shifts in moss distribution and diversity are likely, as well as possible local
extinctions. Understanding the response of moss communities to environmental change
requires a combination of long term field studies, incorporation of new technologies and
continued monitoring programs, including conservation plans in a proactive response.",,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/13864",,"en","English",,"University of Canterbury",,"All Rights Reserved",,,,,"Plants on the edge: How will Antarctic mosses respond to global environmental change?",,"Electronic Thesis or Dissertation","Science","University of Canterbury","Postgraduate Certificate","Postgraduate Certificate in Antarctic Studies","College of Science, University of Canterbury","ucresearchrepository@canterbury.ac.nz",,

 It is hoped
that this review may highlight several aspects: firstly, document the development of

global climate change inside the ATS; and thirdly observe the ATS bodies and members in
researching and managing climate change.
To achieve these goals, the analysis reviews papers submitted to the annual ATCMs
either as working papers or information papers since the year 2000. This method provides a
number of advantages: firstly, selecting papers from this source serves as a filter. It is
expected that information provided to the ATCMs are of significantly scientifically robust
and represent the best thinking on climate change at the time; secondly, there is
significant scope within this forum for adequate criticism of the papers; and thirdly, the
meetings occur annually which provides opportunity to track the progression of scientific
understanding as well as the broader acceptance of climate change in the ATS.
Additionally, to further develop the growth in scientific understanding of climate change,
the paper draws on scientific papers that are referenced in ATCM documents.
The paper opens by briefly introducing the Antarctica Treaty System so as to provide
context for the ATCMs. Having made this introduction, the paper recaps global climate

Mount Erebus was discovered in 1841 and for the moment it is the most active Volcano on the Antarctic continent. It is located on Ross Island in the Ross Sea of Antarctica (Harpel et al. 2004). ROSS Island is the base for both New Zealand's Scott Base and the USAS McMurdo Station and this has resulted in the volcanoes frequent observation since 1956. In 1972 yearly observations of the volcanoe's lava lake were begun (From Kyle 1982 as cited in Harpel et al. 2004). Since then it has been studied extensively, and numerous papers have been Written on its geology.
Mount Erebus is the Worlds southernmost active volcano and is 3794 meters high. It dominates the landscape of Ross Island and its volcanic structure and the processes which have led to the formation of these features are discussed in this review with close reference to Esser, Kyle and McIntosh (2004). Mount Erebus is classed as an alkaline intraplate stratovolcano (Behrendt 1999) and has been produced by distinct volcanic phases (Esser, Kyle & McIntosh 2004). Within the last 95,000 years eruptive activity in the summit region of Mount Erebus has included lava flows, Small strombolian eruptions and at least one, possibly two caldera forming events. At least one plinian eruption has occurred from Mt Erebus within this time frame (Harpelet al. 2004).
The mountain produces frequent strombolian style eruptions from a convecting phonolitic lava lake which is located at the bottom of the main Crater (Panter & Winter 2008). The volcano is directly associated with the Terror Rift (Behrendt 1999). This is in turn associated with the West Antarctic Rift System making Mount Erebus one of many volcanoes associated with this larger continental scale rift system (Kyle 1990). A thermal anomaly has been observed underneath Ross Island and this is thought to represent a mantle plume feature which is responsible for the volcanism of Ross Island (Gupta, Zhao & Rai 2009).",,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/13888",,"en","English",,"University of Canterbury",,"All Rights Reserved",,,,,"The geology of Mount Erebus and its tectonic setting in Antarctica",,"Electronic Thesis or Dissertation","Science","University of Canterbury","Postgraduate Certificate","Postgraduate Certificate in Antarctic Studies","College of Science, University of Canterbury","ucresearchrepository@canterbury.ac.nz",,

conduct of scientific research, in particular research essential to understanding the global

The appearance of the term 'wilderness' in 1991 rather than 1959 reflects the

The reviewer will then explore literature outlining the proponents and opponents of mining for oil in Antarctica, and then examine the effectiveness of The Madrid Protocol with regards to mineral exploitation by looking at the pros and cons of The Protocol.",,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/13891",,"en","English",,"University of Canterbury",,"All Rights Reserved",,,,,"Mining Oil: The Antarctic Treaty System, CRAMRA, and the Effectiveness of The Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty.",,"Electronic Thesis or Dissertation","Science","University of Canterbury","Postgraduate Certificate","Postgraduate Certificate in Antarctic Studies","College of Science, University of Canterbury","ucresearchrepository@canterbury.ac.nz",,
"16955","10092/13758",,"Maxwell, Bob",,,"2012","The South Pole Traverse is a 1650 Km overland (ice) route from the US McMurdo
station on Ross Island to the Amundsen–Scott South Pole station. The route was
formed to enable supplies and fuel to be transported overland by means of tractor
trains and specialised sleds, which previously was completed by multiple flights using
Hercules LC-130 aircraft (Anandakrishnan, 2001).
This paper aims to briefly outline the controversy around the proposal and formation
of the South Pole Traverse. First a short overview of the construction and reasons
behind the construction of the route will be presented. A search of the literature is
next presented, with further analysis of the three key themes identified: environmental
impact, wilderness impact and tourism. Discussion of the various themes is
undertaken, concluding with suggestions for future research.
The primary reason the South Pole overland traverse was considered necessary was
because of the efficiency savings sought, due to the high cost of flying fuel and
materials to the South Pole Station. The main savings would be realised with respect
to savings of fuel, as it is up to 40% more fuel efficient to transport overland than by
air freight (National Science Foundation, 2004). Other advantages include the
opportunity to conduct more science by freeing up planes that other wise would be
used to re-supply the South Pole Station. Environmental impact would be also
reduced by lowering the amount of fuel consumed, and larger load sizes are able to be
hauled compared to flown.
Construction of the route started in the 2002-2003 summer season, and the route was
operational four seasons later in the 2005-2006 summer season (The Antarctic Sun,
2006). The first operational traverse was completed during the 2008 – 09 season (The
Antarctic Sun, 2009). The route traverses two crevasse fields, the McMurdo shear
zone and the lower Leverett glacier. Crevasses in these areas were filled in using
explosives and heavy snow moving machinery, allowing the safe passage of the
tractor trains. As the areas of crevasse fields are constantly moving every season
requires newly opened crevasses to be identified and filled. The remaining route is
relatively flat with little attention needed. The entire route is marked by flags at
regular intervals to indicate the way (The Antarctic Sun, 2009).
The route selected (figure 1) was not the most direct path to the South Pole. Rather it
goes along the Ross Ice Shelf almost parallel to the Transantarctic Mountains, then 
rises up the Leverett glacier to an altitude of 2400m gaining the polar plateau, turning
south for the last 440Km to the Pole. The Leverett glacier was chosen as it has a low
gradient, low katabatic wind component (Schwerdtfeger, 1984) and a relatively low
number of crevasses compared to more direct routes. Early suggestions that the route
would also supply an on ice cable for internet traffic (IT World, 2002), was never
realised due to the movement of glacial ice flows.
It takes approximately 40 days to deliver a cargo load to the South Pole Station, and
each load consists of 110 tonnes of cargo, equivalent of 11 re-supply flights of the LC
130 aircraft previously used (National Science Foundation, 2006). The return trip
carrying waste and obsolete materials is significantly shorter (The Antarctic Sun,
2009). Limitations of load size are also negated by the use of tractor trains; large loads
previously were constrained to the 3m by 3m door opening on the LC 130 aircraft.
Severe weather conditions on the continent hinder many re-supply flights, were as the
tractor trains are able to continue in all but the worst weather (Niiler, 2011). The
South Pole Traverse does not intend to stop all flights to the South Pole Station,
personnel, equipment and supplies are still being transported by aircraft, while large
cargo and bulk fuel is going overland (Anandakrishnan, 2001).
There are many names given to the overland route from McMurdo to the South Pole
such as South Pole Traverse, South Pole Route, Ice Road, South Pole Highway and 
Surface Traverse. In this paper different terms will be used with respect to different
themes as discussed next",,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/13896",,"en","English",,"University of Canterbury",,"All Rights Reserved",,,,,"The controversy around the proposal and formation of the South Pole Traverse",,"Electronic Thesis or Dissertation","Science","University of Canterbury","Postgraduate Certificate","Postgraduate Certificate in Antarctic Studies","College of Science, University of Canterbury","ucresearchrepository@canterbury.ac.nz",,

particularly nematodes. Nematodes are a dominant soil invertebrate in Antarctic ecosystems
and have developed a suite of cold tolerance mechanisms to cope with freezing events and
desiccation. Panagrolaimus davidi is one of these nematode species, believed to have
exceptional cold tolerance abilities, above and beyond that of its counterparts. Several years
of research has produced an impressive literature base on cold tolerance mechanisms. Upon
reading this literature it is immediately clear that investigators agree to the classes of cold
tolerance mechanisms and the species which employ each strategy. However, there are areas
requiring further research; switching between strategies is apparent in some species, which is
suggestive of plasticity among mechanisms, yet a solid conclusion has not been reached. In
the case of P. davidi there is little information as to how members of Panagrolaimus vary in
their cold tolerance mechanisms. It is also obvious that studying cold tolerance abilities can
be problematic as nematodes have to be removed from their natural habitat.",,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/13899",,"en","English",,"University of Canterbury",,"All Rights Reserved",,,,,"Surviving the Ice: A critical review of cold tolerance strategies in Antarctic nematodes",,"Electronic Thesis or Dissertation","Science","University of Canterbury","Postgraduate Certificate","Postgraduate Certificate in Antarctic Studies","College of Science, University of Canterbury","ucresearchrepository@canterbury.ac.nz",,

Best illustrates that Maori have a history of exploring and travelling. This review attempts to investigate Maori connections within Antarctica's history to establish where Maori youth pursuing Antarctic interests can connect and identify with. Due to knowledge being passed down by oral tradition within the Maori culture this review tries to consolidate what little literature may be available for future reference.
It highlights common themes such as oppression, discrimination, biculturalism and whaling and as such a lot of the literature is a reflection of the times in which they were written and could have been an impediment on Maori involvement on relationships with the Antarctic. It also shows that when papers and books were written reference to New Zealand is always assumed to include Maori with no need to differentiate between ethnicities until it becomes
a criminal issue in which case the dissociation is made certain. (Dodds & Yusoff, 2005., Dannette, 2010).

"16959","10092/13758",,"Christensen, Aurora",,,"2011","The issue of Antarctic Cruise Ship Tourism has gained much attention over the last
twenty years as cruise ship and passenger numbers steadily increase. Cruise ship
tourism accounts for 96% of tourism to the Antarctic and is growing at twice the rate
of tourism worldwide. Currently the cruise ship industry is managed through The
Antarctic Treaty System (ATS), Non Governmental Organisations (NGO) (self
regulation), guidelines, various treaties and a series of international laws (Bauer &
Dowling 2006).
Antarctica remains a land mass without a governing organisation with the requisite
sovereignty and international legal personality, to enable complete enforcement of any
rules, regulations and laws that may be developed to cover the region and its
current/future needs. Sea borne tourism raises a number of concerns, as numbers grow
the likelihood of maritime disasters and environmental impacts increases; and needs
to be carefully planned for.
Cruise tourism in the Antarctic is cold climate tourism that takes place without a local
population, the usual tourism infrastructure and without the normal governmental
involvement that comes hand in hand with the exploitation of a resource. Since the
beginning of the modern Antarctic tourism industry in 1969, the number of tourists in
Antarctica has grown from a few hundred to more than 30,000 each year (Bauer &

that are of significant interest to planetary science. They can hold clues to the early formation of the solar
system, the formation of the moon and the earth, and even evidence of life on Mars. Meteorites found in
Antarctica are extremely well preserved because they have been buried in the ice for up to several hundred
thousand years.
Following impact, the meteorites are thought to move with the ice and are typically released into the sea
and become unrecoverable. However some ice movement does not end in the sea, instead the ice raises
against a mountain barrier and is removed by ablation (sublimation, melting and abrasion). The meteorites
held within such ablating ice can remain on the surface for extended periods of time, where they have been
found in large numbers.

diseases of Antarctic birds are split into sections according to organism. Each group is tackled in turn and the
prevalent illnesses discussed. The findings are that there is no one prevalent disease of the Antarctic Bird
population. There is also not one specific ailment that affects particular birds. Penguins and Skua are equally
as likely to obtain a tick infestation. Endo/Ectoparasites are the main problems facing birds but have been
prevalent for many years. Viruses and bacterium are a newer threat but just as deadly, and in some cases
more so due to the changing climate. But it is without the conjunction of both parasite and organism that
makes establishment difficult.
The health of the Antarctic bird population is a primary concern for almost all people. The charismatic
presentation that penguins and other such birds of the isolated continent, is often however overlooked.
Overall there is a large lack in accurate and current research on the diseases of Antarctic birds. Most of the
information available has been done prior to the 1980s and is only just showing another boom now.
The major affects that the human population is having on this ecosystem is still unknown. There have been

"16967","10092/13758",,"Roberts, James",,,"2011","As an expert in neither Antarctic politics nor international law, I concede to being somewhat
impressionable in my uptake of information on these subjects. It was recently conveyed to me that the
success of the Antarctic Treaty System (ATS) was due in a large part to its flexibility. This assertion seemed
plausible, the Treaty has endured and accommodated significant international changes over last 50 years,
and through its instruments and measures has successfully maintained the Antarctic as a place for peace
and science, the respective objects of Article I and II of the Antarctic Treaty. If flexibility is a quality which
has afforded such success then in relation to the Treaty it is considered here a topic worthy of further
exploration.
The first part of this review provides a scan of the Antarctic literature in an effort to understand the
origins of ATSs reputation for the flexibility of the system as a whole. In doing so, this review identifies a
shift over time in the identification of flexibility as a positive attribute of the system, to one having
increasingly problematic consequences. Within the Annexes and Articles of Treaty instruments
themselves a second use of flexibility as a concept is also detected, particular attention is paid to Article IV
of the Treaty which is central to the issue of flexibility for the system as a whole. Article IV has also been
subject to diverse and evolving opinion regarding its effect on the overall ability of the system to
accommodate change. Some see it as a universally accommodating mechanism which will take the Treaty
forward (Beck, 2009; Heap, 1983; Joyner, 1999; Watts, 1986), whilst others see it as limiting and cause for
the ATS to have stalled in recent years (Grob, 2007; Hemmings, 2007; Marcoux, 1970). The second and
third parts of the paper review briefly explore an observe shift from the use of flexibility to ambiguity in
the language used to describe the ATS. At this point, reference material is extended outside the literature
of Antarctica to broader sources which consider the use of ambiguity as a constructive mechanism. As a
conclusion some questions are proposed regarding the idiosyncrasies of ambiguity in the context of the
ATS.",,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/13908",,"en","English",,"University of Canterbury",,"All Rights Reserved",,,,,"Flexibility, Ambiguity and the Construction of the Antarctic Treaty System",,"Electronic Thesis or Dissertation","Science","University of Canterbury","Postgraduate Certificate","Postgraduate Certificate in Antarctic Studies","College of Science, University of Canterbury","ucresearchrepository@canterbury.ac.nz",,

come (IPCC, 2007). How will WAIS respond to this warming? To answer this question we
need to know how it responded to climate changes in the geological past. One of the best
places to find this is in the Ross Sea, which is a depositional basin that has a record of all the
sediments coming off Antarctica over millions of years (Chapman, et al. 2006).
Many coring programs have drilled in the Ross Sea, with the ANDRILL (ANtarctica DRILLing)
project being the most recent. It has unveiled much of Antarctica’s climate for the last
approximate 40 million years (Naish, 2008). These Ross Sea coring projects have given us an

following:
The observations for variation have proved very good, and the results
of these alone are sufficient reward for all the monotonous labour
connected with the magnetic observations, if, as I believe they will do,
they enable those who go down to the sea in ships to navigate with a
greater measure of confidence and safety those waters that wash the
shores of our southern possessions and South America. (Armitage
1905)
Armitage was one of many navigators, scientists and expeditioners to
investigate the nature of terrestrial magnetism up to the famous sledge
journey by Mawson, McKay and David to the vicinity of the south magnetic
pole in January 1909. I believe that geomagnetic research flourished between
1830 and the Heroic era of Antarctic exploration. Although much research had
been undertaken during that period, and many questions answered, Louis
Bauer (Director of the Department of Terrestrial Magnetism of the Carnegie
Institution of Washington) indicated there were still gaps in fundamental
knowledge when he wrote in 1914:
The accumulation of data must at present be the chief aim of the
student of the earth’s magnetism.(Bauer 1914)

The context of time is lineal and ephemeral. An event takes place only once and is then the subject of oral, visual or written history. Its existence and immediacy is transitory in the context of time.
Perhaps as a response to the transitory nature of human existence mankind seeks to maintain tangible links with the past. 
New Zealand holds closely to a written treaty that we see as a touchstone with our recent past. The Treaty of Waitangi is not only the cornerstone of race relations it has major ramifications in our country in all areas of economic and social reality. It defines who we are as a nation. It is a tangible connection with history.

Whether mankind reveres a treaty or the building in which that treaty was signed, it is universal that we hold as central and important such objects that take us closer to our transitory and ephemeral past. 

Antarctica stands unique in that the first human dwellings built on the continent are still intact. In fact, all human endeavours in Antarctica have taken place within the space of just over two centuries and much of it is still in existence.
Time has passed since the ‘Heroic Age’ of exploration, but, the actual dwellings connected with the Heroic Age of exploration are still with us.
Those basic huts erected by Scott, Shackleton and Borchgrevink are tangible links with our past and as such take on an importance far beyond their physical entity. They are as powerful in our country’s collective consciousness as the Liberty Bell is for the United States or the Stone of Scone is for Scotland.

They have the power to fire the collective imagination and they remain potent symbols of our nation’s identity.
As such they have an importance to New Zealand’s sense of national identity far in excess of their physical entity.



Our closest neighbour, Australia, has an Antarctic history equally as important to them and the preservation and restoration of their Antarctic heritage is similarly seen as vitally important to their sense of national identity. The importance of Australia’s greatest Antarctic explorer, Douglas Mawson, is esteemed so highly in their national consciousness that he features on their $100 dollar bill. Ed Hillary only features on our $5 dollar bill! Could this be indicative of the relative importance the Australians attach to their Antarctic history?

In Australia the preservation and restoration of Antarctic heritage is charged to the Mawson’s Huts Foundation.
New Zealand’s Antarctic Heritage Trust (AHT) was formed in 1987, nine years earlier than the Mawson’s Huts Foundation (MHF). 

The AHT is an independent charitable trust based in Christchurch.
The AHT is charged with the preservation and restoration of our Antarctic heritage. More specifically, it was created to care for sites important to the history of the Heroic Age of exploration located in the Ross Sea region of Antarctica

"17009","10092/13758",,"Winton, Victoria",,,"2008","Technological advances in the twentieth century have enabled scientists to undertake
research on virtually every location on the Earth. Parallel advances in space
technology have provided a rapidly increasing number of satellite platforms that can
be used to study complex physical processes in the Earth-atmosphere system. Remote
sensing is the small or large-scale acquisition of information of an object or
phenomenon in a given area by the use of recording devices that are not in physical
contact with the object or area of interest, such as aircraft or satellite. The basis of
remote sensing is the electromagnetic spectrum. Satellite remote sensing often permits
real time, year round and long-term study. Remote sensing has greatly improved mass
balance estimates of ice sheets and glaciers in Antarctica. Mass balance is the
difference between accumulation and ablation of mass on an ice sheet or glacier over
a time period.
There are three ways to measure the mass balance of an ice sheet: the mass-budget
method, the volume method, and the geodetic method. The significant development of
Synthetic Radar Altimetry (SAR) has allowed the measurement of surface height in
the mass-budget method. The volume method uses satellite radar altimetry to measure
changes in surface elevation of ice sheets. The geodetic method is an emerging
approach that exploits gravity and holds huge potential for the future. This review will
focus on these three methods. Although these methods have made dramatic
improvements on mass balance estimates over the last decade, each method still has
limitations. Mass balance products of remote sensing are important because they
assist in interpretation and analysis of global change (Konig et al., 2001).
In the field of glaciology, remote sensing has proven to be a particularly useful tool
because areas of interest are often inaccessible, such as those at high latitudes in
Antarctica. Other physical characteristics of Antarctica that have limitations on
ground based point measurements include: climatic extremes, the large spatial
coverage, environmental sensitivity, the polar ‘night’ and the continent’s natural
resources.",,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/13946",,"en","English",,"University of Canterbury",,"All Rights Reserved",,,,,"Remote Sensing of Ice Sheet Mass Balance in Antarctica",,"Electronic Thesis or Dissertation","Science","University of Canterbury","Postgraduate Certificate","Postgraduate Certificate in Antarctic Studies","College of Science, University of Canterbury","ucresearchrepository@canterbury.ac.nz",,

gas emissions is becoming clear; lawmakers, businesses, the public and investors are
being presented with a number of new ideas for how to achieve these goals. Recently
one such approach, ‘iron fertilization’ of the oceans - the process of ‘seeding’ some
parts of the ocean with the essential micronutrient iron in order to promote plankton
growth and thus remove atmospheric carbon (in the form of CO2) and store it in the
oceans - has been promoted in the hope that iron fertilization could go some way to
sequester carbon emissions1
. However, this process raises a number of questions,
including its effectiveness as a market-based sequestration system as well as the
possible negative effects on the ocean and other environmental systems.
Fertilizers of various forms have become a common means toward improving plant
growth. Imagine a fertilizer so powerful it could increase a yield by over 2500%. This
is what scientists observed when they ‘fertilized’ a patch of ocean in 1995 with Iron
Sulfate as part of the IronEX II experiment. But why would this chemical have had
such a profound effect on phytoplankton growth?
Over 20% of the world’s oceans are nutrient rich but iron poor
2
, which is the limiting
nutrient for phytoplankton growth. By adding sufficient levels of iron to the surface
ocean water, a phytoplankton bloom can be induced, and the effect can be quite
dramatic. During the 1995 experiment, 450 Kg of iron was spread over a 100 km2
patch of the ocean, producing a phytoplankton bloom which consumed over 2500 tons
of carbon dioxide from the surface ocean waters3
. Whether iron fertilization has been
a viable mechanism controlling climate in the past, and whether it could be useful in
the future is a topic of current debate. What is clear from fertilization experiments to
date is that they have been effective tools allowing us to question the role of iron in
controlling phytoplankton growth, nutrient cycling and the flux of carbon from the
atmosphere to the deep sea.",,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/13939",,"en","English",,"University of Canterbury",,"All Rights Reserved",,,,,"“To Fe or not to Fe?” Iron fertilisation in the Southern Ocean",,"Electronic Thesis or Dissertation","Science","University of Canterbury","Postgraduate Certificate","Postgraduate Certificate in Antarctic Studies","College of Science, University of Canterbury","ucresearchrepository@canterbury.ac.nz",,

was established in 1957 during the International Geophysical Year. The existence of the
subglacial lakes was unknown at that time for they were not discovered until the late 1960s.
[19,21]
After coming to a depth of 52m in 1958, drilling was stopped for almost a decade until 1969.
From then on, various holes were drilled and as a result thousands of meters of ice cores were
recovered at Vostok Station. The drilling at borehole number 5G started on 20 February 1990
and it reached its record depth of 3650m in the summer season 2005/06. The data obtained by
these ice cores revealed much information about the last 420,000 years. [21]
In the late 1960s due to seismic soundings water was assumed to be beneath the ice sheet. In
the 1970s, an airborne radar mapping project driven by the US, UK and Denmark revealed
flat reflections at the bottom of the ice sheet which also suggested water beneath it. The
existence of Lake Vostok was first noted in 1973 by scientists of the Scott Polar Research
Institute [15]. The full size of Lake Vostok, the biggest lake under the Antarctic ice sheet, was
revealed by the European satellite ERS-1 in 1996 (Fig.1). Its surface covers an area of

animals are considered globally as one of the most significant threats to biodiversity (McKinney & Lockwood
1999 cited in Frenot et al. 2005). Almost every continent and ecosystem type on earth has been affected by
NNS often resulting in irreversible changes to the structure and functioning of ecosystems.
Antarctica, with no indigenous population, remained free of human visitation until approximately two
centuries ago. Isolated from the rest of the world through its climate and geography, the Continent, which
contains less than 2% ice free areas (Potter 2006), has developed a series of simple (some of which have been
described as the simplest on the planet [Convey, 2007]), yet interdependent eco-systems and is one of the last
continents where biogeographic boundaries still exist (De Poorter & Gilbert et al. 2006).
Research to date indicates the vast majority of the Continent has escaped biological invasions. However,
increasing human visitation and activity both to, from and within, the Continent (predominantly by national
Antarctic programmes and tourists) combined with current climatic trends means there is an increasing
awareness by Treaty Parties of the risk of NNS unintentionally being introduced and becoming established on
the Continent. Another significant risk recently identified by Treaty Parties is the impacts of intra-continental
contamination whereby native species have the potential to be unintentionally transferred across natural
biogeography boundaries within the Continent into ecosystems where they do not naturally exist (De Poorter
& Gilbert et al. 2006)

extremely interesting variety of vegetation. Antarctic flora has been studied
extensively, with the most intense focus over the last forty years (Green et al.

extreme growing conditions of the area (Brabyn et al. 2005). The ability to
survive in the terrestrial habitats of Antarctica requires organisms to possess
a wide variety of unique adaptations.
This report is an introduction to the terrestrial vegetation found in Antarctica,
with a more in-depth focus on the adaptations of lichens. Extensive literature
exists in the areas of Antarctic botany and ecology and these topics are
becoming even more relevant with the threat of global environmental

untouched by human activity. During the early years of southern exploration Antarctica’s
worth to science and humanity was dismissed as a waste of time, but as our
understanding of the earths various environmental systems increased it showed
Antarctica influences much of the way the earth works. With increasing amounts of
research taking place it is becoming clear that Antarctica not only profoundly influences
us, but that we are globally linked and are having an influence on it too through pollution
produced locally and from all over the globe.
Most human activity and its associated pollution in Antarctica is highly localized, and
waste disposal in the early years was in the form of snow pits, waste dumps, open pit
burning, and release of untreated sewage into the oceans. This was the mindset in those
times, but has now changed to a more environmentally aware regime. Antarctica is now
facing a more serious threat from pollution which began at the time of the industrial
revolution. Heavy metals such as Pb, Cd, As, and Hg, and volatile organic compounds
(VOCs) such as chlorofluorocarbons, pesticides, and industrial compounds can now be
found in places humans have never been before. These pollutants are transported to the
poles via the atmosphere in the form of aerosols and global distillation of volatile
compounds, and are accumulating in snow and wildlife.",,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/13923",,"en","English",,"University of Canterbury",,"All Rights Reserved",,,,,"Heavy metals: A heavy burden on the icy continent.",,"Electronic Thesis or Dissertation","Science","University of Canterbury","Postgraduate Certificate","Postgraduate Certificate in Antarctic Studies","College of Science, University of Canterbury","ucresearchrepository@canterbury.ac.nz",,

of Antarctica. There are 17 species of penguin, of which eight breed in the Antarctic region
(the Antarctic continent and other areas within and around the Antarctic convergence)
(Woehler 1993). These eight species comprise the Adelie (Pygoscelis adelie), the Emperor
(Aptenodytes forsteri), the Chinstrap (Pygoscelis antarctica) the Gentoo (Pygoscelis
papua), the King (Aptenodytes patagonica), the Macaroni (Eudyptes chrysolophus), the
Rockhopper (Eudyptes crestatus) and the Royal Penguin (Eudyptes schlegeli), although
some regard the Royal Penguin as a sub-species of the Macaroni (Woehler 1993). Of
these eight species, only the Adelie and the Emperor breed on the Antarctic continent, with
all others breeding either on the Antarctic Peninsula or on sub-Antarctic islands (see Figure
1 for distribution information).
Penguins are highly adapted for living in the cold environment of the Antarctic region. They
have very dense plumage, made up of overlapping individual feathers, as well as a layer of
down (Allen et al. 1985). Underneath the feathers and down is a thick layer of fat providing
excellent insulation from the cold conditions they experience. Penguins are flightless, with
their wings modified into flippers for swimming. They also possess a short stubby tail and a
torpedo shaped body, all of which assist them in the water (Allen et al. 1985). Penguins
feed on zooplankton, squid and fish, and feed their chicks by regurgitation (Young 1994).",,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/13924",,"en","English",,"University of Canterbury",,"All Rights Reserved",,,,,"Population dynamics of Antarctic and sub-Antarctic Penguin species",,"Electronic Thesis or Dissertation","Science","University of Canterbury","Postgraduate Certificate","Postgraduate Certificate in Antarctic Studies","College of Science, University of Canterbury","ucresearchrepository@canterbury.ac.nz",,

mainly in response to concerns that an increase in fishing of commercial species in the
Southern Ocean could have a serious effect on population of other marine life. CCAMLR is
now responsible for safeguarding the environment and protecting the integrity of the
ecosystem of the ocean surrounding Antarctica.  
The Antarctic marine ecosystem is unique both for its geographic and climatic characteristics.
Much of the Antarctic marine ecosystem is considered to be of low productivity and the
associated food chain is very short, based almost entirely on krill. Krill are the key species
crucial to the sustainability and production of all other fisheries.
Krill fisheries in the Southern Ocean may have immense long‐term impacts on the marine
ecosystem, disrupting the food web and blocking energy flows through the system.
Currently two major finfish species are also exploited from Antarctic waters, the Patagonian
toothfish and the Mackerel icefish.  
  
The convention is primarily focused on the conservation of living resources within the stated
conservation area. Where insufficient data are available to assess sustainable harvesting
levels or other conservation measures, a precautionary approach has been developed to
account for the potential risks associated with incomplete knowledge about the dynamics of
a particular resource. Fisheries in Antarctic water may only continue by maintaining the
ecosystem in a relatively stable state. The challenge is to understand the processes through
which the marine ecosystem functions to achieve a sustainable fishery in the Southern Ocean

live in the extreme environment. These adaptations are specialised strategies that species
have evolved to aid survival by increasing reproductive success and lifespan of the
individual and have occurred over geological time frame. These survival strategies fall into
three main categories, which are biochemical changes, physiological changes and
behavioural changes. Biochemical changes are those that occur at a cellular or protein level,
or chemical processes. An example of this is the polypeptides of antifreeze glycoproteins
and antifreeze peptides of notothenioid fish such as Pagothenia borchgrevinki.
Physiological changes are changes to the structure of a species to help the species function
more efficiently. These are generally larger in scale and can be measured or observed, such
as the Antarctic krill Euphausia superba retaining the ability to moult into adulthood in
response to food supply. Behavioural changes such as the migration of Adélie penguins
Pygoscelis adeliae in the winter months show conscious movement to a northern location
where the chances of survival are increased. There are many survival strategies in
Antarctica and most species have a combination of the different types. The aim of this

the range of survival strategies, using one species as an example of each. Scientific journal

"17015","10092/13758",,"Kruetzmann, Nikolai",,,"2007","Since its prediction and discovery, ozone depletion in the stratosphere
over Polar Regions has been a topic of widespread interest and debate.
Starting in the late 1970s, when the Antarctic ozone observations began,
there has been a dramatic decrease in ozone during the polar spring each
year (WMO, 2003). The total amount of column ozone regularly goes below
220 DU1
 in the atmosphere above Antarctica, at which point it is defined as an
ozone hole (Newman et al., 2004). Whilst the influences on the mechanisms
that cause this dramatic ozone loss each year are many, the essential
prerequisites for ozone destruction are stratospheric chlorine and bromine
(WMO, 2003).
In the few years after 1979, the depletion of ozone rapidly increased
from year to year due to the increased emission of chlorofluorocarbons
(CFCs) through anthropogenic industrial activities. The tropospherestratosphere2
 exchange at low latitudes allows compounds such as CFCs to
enter the stratosphere. Once there, these compounds are transported to the
poles via Brewer-Dobson3
 circulation (Reid, 2000). Here they have very long
lifetimes and they can continuously destroy ozone for several decades.
This one part of the reason, why the effective ban on the emission of
CFCs agreed to in “The Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the
Ozone Layer” in 1989 (Solomon, 1999) has not yet resulted in a significant
reduction of the size of the Antarctic ozone hole. Furthermore, the actual
extent of ozone destruction is also influenced by other factors such as the
polar vortex, polar stratospheric clouds, temperature, water vapour, aerosols
and planetary wave activity, which are highly interdependent. How they
contribute to severe ozone depletion over Antarctica and why the recovery of
stratospheric ozone is believed to be in progress, although still undetected,
will be discussed in this paper.",,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/13951",,"en","English",,"University of Canterbury",,"All Rights Reserved",,,,,"The Development and possible recovery of the Antarctic Ozone Hole.",,"Electronic Thesis or Dissertation","Science","University of Canterbury","Postgraduate Certificate","Postgraduate Certificate in Antarctic Studies","College of Science, University of Canterbury","ucresearchrepository@canterbury.ac.nz",,

The effect of the scenery, wildlife, isolation and wilderness can change people's lives.
The first people to visit the Antarctic were explorers enticed by the notion of discovering and exploring new land. Hot on their trails were commercial fisheries, following the reports of rich marine life in the Antarctic waters. The quest for knowledge and science brought the next wave of visitors to the Antarctic in the 1950's, and now with easier access to the continent we are seeing increasingly
larger number of tourists.
Antarctic tourism started in the late 1950's when 500 fare-paying passengers went to the South Shetland Islands aboard a naval transportationship (IAATO 1). From the 1960's the number of tourists to the Antarctic has been increasing each year, reaching 1500 in the 1980's. The numbers of tourists has continued to increase to just under 23,000 for the 2004-2005 season (Landau, 2001;
IAATO web site 2).
As the number of tourists to the Antarctic has increased so too have concerns over the impact they may be causing to the fragile Antarctic environment. This concern escalated when tourism began to diversify from the traditional cruise only trips to include more land based activities and independent
adventure tourism.
The risks associated with tourism, in particular adventure or independent tourism, are significant. These expeditions are often dangerous and have the potential to disrupt the national science programs
and commercial tour operations (XXVII ATCM/WP 02).
As the risks posed by tourism have become more apparent, the Antarctic community has been seeking effective ways to regulate the tourism industry. This has proved to be difficult given the unique treaty

Ocean regulation is difficult because of the vastness of the ocean and the number of

There are large difficulties in the logistics of High Seas regulation that creates
loopholes in the current IUU Southern Ocean system. Using FOCs of states that are
not signatories to International agreements such as CCAMLR intensifies the problem,
as they are not legally bound to abide by any measures implemented by international
agreement. The use of FOCs by a number of CCAMLR nationals is evident yet
current trends in international economy and business make these ‘front companies’

separate entities by the Transantarctic Mountains. These are regarded as the West and East Antarctic
Ice Sheets (Figure 1). The West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS) contains 3.8 million km3
 of ice and,
unlike the East Antarctic Ice Sheet (EAIS), is a marine ice sheet which implies that the groundingline
is below sea-level (Figure 2). Weertman (1974) originally proposed that a marine ice sheet, such
as the WAIS, is inherently unstable. However, this analysis was based on a simple model of a marine
ice sheet that did not include fast-flowing, wet-based ice streams, which are now known to dominate
the grounded ice sheet (Bentley, 1998). It has been estimated that the ice streams on the WAIS move
~10-100 times faster than the adjacent non-streaming ice sheet (Bindschaler and Scambos, 1991;
Whillans and van der Veen, 1993). Swithinbank (1954) defines an ice stream as part of an inland ice
sheet in which the ice flows more rapidly than, and not necessarily in the same direction as, the
surrounding ice. This definition indicates two main points: (1) ice streams are surrounded by ice as,
if it were surrounded by rock, it would be considered an outlet glacier, and (2) it is part of the inland
ice sheet, therefore it is not floating.",,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/13920",,"en","English",,"University of Canterbury",,"All Rights Reserved",,,,,"West Antarctica Ice Streams – A Review of the Proposed Mechanisms of Ice Streaming.",,"Electronic Thesis or Dissertation","Science","University of Canterbury","Postgraduate Certificate","Postgraduate Certificate in Antarctic Studies","College of Science, University of Canterbury","ucresearchrepository@canterbury.ac.nz",,
"16997","10092/13758",,"Balham, David",,,"2008","By the accounts of most who visit them the Dry Valleys of southern Victoria Land, on
the shores of the Ross Sea, exert a strange fascination. Left literally high and dry by
receding glaciers, these “oases in the ice” (Clarke) are starkly beautiful. They are of
unusual scientific interest too: stripped of the ice mantle up to 4km deep which covers
most of Antarctica, they provide a rare opportunity to study the continent’s geology, flora
and fauna.
But not all of the secrets of the Dry Valleys are readily revealed. From the first years of
Antarctic exploration observers were puzzled to find the contorted and mummified
carcases of seals many kilometres up the valleys and in surrounding areas, often at
considerable heights above sea level. What drove the seals to trek doggedly away from
their colonies and food sources until they apparently starved to death remained a mystery:
theories from tidal waves to climate change, glacial retreat or suicide were put forward,
but none seemed satisfactlory.
Also mysterious was the age of the carcases. Early efforts at carbon dating suggested
some of the seal remains were up to 2600 years old, but the inaccuracy of carbon-dating
marine creatures in Antarctica makes these results unreliable. A more recent theory is that
the harsh conditions prevailing in the Dry Valleys obliterate bone and tissue quickly, and
that even the most weathered of the carcases are only a few decades old (Dort 1981).
Other questions abound. Most of the seal carcases are Crabeater seals (Lobodon
carcinophaguis), yet the dominant seal in McMurdo Sound, where they appear to have
come from, is the Weddell (Leptonychotes weddellii). The seals demonstrate a puzzling
determination to march to their deaths: faint tracks from one seal found dead on the
surface of Lake Bonney (Dort 1981) ran for several kilometres in an almost straight line,
and a live animal heading inland across the McMurdo Ice Shelf resisted all attempts to
point it back towards the sea (Stirling and Kooyman). This has led to speculation that
these unfortunate animals are following some sort of internal guidance system which has
gone wrong (Dort 1981).
After a flurry of activity studying the seals in the sixties and seventies, little work appears
to have been done since. Some study is currently focused on the microbial colonies
beneath the dead seals, which apparently differ greatly from one carcase to another. Dr
Craig Cary of Waikato University is shortly to publish on this topic.
This paper will attempt to follow the trail of the seals, as it were, from the earliest
observations by Scott and Shackleton’s parties to the most recent – and still inconclusive
- theories about how and why they met their strange deaths.",,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/13934",,"en","English",,"University of Canterbury",,"All Rights Reserved",,,,,"The Mummified Seals of the Dry Valleys : A literature review",,"Electronic Thesis or Dissertation","Science","University of Canterbury","Postgraduate Certificate","Postgraduate Certificate in Antarctic Studies","College of Science, University of Canterbury","ucresearchrepository@canterbury.ac.nz",,

congregate in swarms or schools, with thousands of krill packed into a cubic metre of

"17022","10092/13758",,"Taylor, Sam",,,"2007","The Southern Ocean is a highly productive ecosystem that supports large populations
of whales, seals, birds and fish and plankton. It is also one of the largest marine
ecosystems on earth, covering approximately 36 million km², bounded by the
Antarctic Convergence to the north (Bathmann et al 2000).
Supporting the 30 million year old Antarctic marine ecosystem is the small but
abundant Antarctic krill, or Euphausia superba as it is known scientifically (Major
1985). Krill are a key component of the diet of baleen whales, seals, penguins, petrels,
terns, albatrosses, squid and many fish species (Major 1985). Antarctic krill are
commonly found between the Antarctic coast and the edge of the pack ice but are also
found north as far as the 59°S (Everson 1977).
Since the early 1920s, increasing efforts have been made to learn more about this
cryptic species and its significance in the Antarctic ecosystem (Siegel 2005). Research
initiatives such as the First and Second International BIOMASS Experiments (FIBEX
and SIBEX) have focussed on biology, ecology and population dynamics of krill
(Miller and Hampton 1989). Studies such as these have provided information on krill
and the functioning of the Southern Ocean food web, yet there are still many gaps in
our knowledge of krill life histories and trophic interactions due to the difficult
logistics of conducting research in the Southern Ocean. In order to gain critical life
history information on Antarctic krill it is necessary for scientists to compete with
extreme weather and cover large areas of the Southern Ocean surrounding Antarctica
which makes research difficult. Quantitative data on the biomass of krill, larval
recruitment into the population and information on the trophic relationships of krill in
the southern ocean food web are required before a proper understanding of population
dynamics can be achieved. Anthropogenic impacts on the krill population also need to
be examined in order to identify interactions within the ecosystem and manage the
krill resource appropriately. The purpose of this review is to provide an overview of
the biology and physiology of Antarctic krill, while presenting a synthesis of current
knowledge on krill populations and their trophic significance in the Southern Ocean
ecosystem.

tourism. Conservationists that see the increasing tourist numbers released each season by the
International Association of Antarctic Tourist Operators (IAATO) become increasingly concerned
about the impact of the industry on the Antarctic environment. Governments are concerned about
the potential interference tourism could pose for their scientific programmes, or are eager to
develop the economic benefits that tourism represents for their ports. Recent events have ensured
that Antarctic tourism stays on the top of the agenda for the Antarctic community: the first voyage
of the 4,1601 capacity MS Golden Princess into Antarctic waters (Bertram, Gunn and Stonehouse,
2007), the largest tourist vessel to date, the sinking of the emblematic M/V Explorer in 2007 (Austen,
2007) and the grounding of the M/V Ushuaia in 2008 (Revkin and Robbins, 2008).
Previous reviews of the literature on Antarctic tourism have found that the majority of research falls
into three broad themes: tourism patterns; tourism impacts; and tourism policy and management2
(Stewart, Draper and Johnston 2005). Stewart, Draper and Johnston suggest two further research
clusters which require development to further our understanding of Antarctic tourism: Tourist
experience; and Global changes and Large‐scale influences, with the former starting to receive
attention (Powell, Kellert and Ham, 2008).  
This review will not attempt to replicate the existing reviews of Antarctic tourism. Instead it will try
and supplement existing reviews by looking at the most recent debates that have developed in the
last few years. These debates include: ongoing discussion by the Antarctic Treaty Consultative
Parties (ATCPs) at their annual Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting (ATCM), the latest being ATCM
XXXI held in Kyiv, Ukraine, on ways to improve regulation of Antarctic tourism; debates around
monitoring the impact of tourism, including the efficacy of the existing Environmental Impact
Assessment (EIA) regime and inclusion of benefits, such as the ‘ambassadorial’ effect; and debates
around new tourism activities, such as extreme adventure activities and new ‘mega‐yachts’ acting
outside the IAATO system. The review will survey these debates along the three themes outlined,
with tourist patterns and tourism impacts examined in turn, with the responses of the ATCPs

relevant in Antarctica where difficulties in implementing ecological monitoring are
exacerbated by cost, ambiguity of language within the Protocol, limited habitat, lack of

"17048","10092/13758",,"Tisch, Catherine",,,"2005","For over a century scientists in Antarctica have primarily been concerned with the
natural sciences in the disciplines of meteorology, glaciology, geology, oceanography
and biology (Suedfeld and Weiss, 2000). It is only relatively recently that the social
and behavioural sciences have been explored in Antarctica. There are no indigenous
or permanent inhabitants of Antarctica, it is the only one whose inhabitants are
primarily concerned with scientific research and it is an environment in which
communities of different nationalities work and live together in (more or less) perfect
harmony. As such, it is an extremely interesting place to study psychology and
adaptations to new and unique environments.
Despite harsh environmental conditions, humans have inhabited Antarctica for over
100 years, since it was discovered and ‘conquered’ during the heroic era. Since the
International Geophysical Year of 1957-58 and the signing of the Antarctic Treaty
System, there has been continuous human presence on the ice in the form of
isolated research stations, many of which are occupied throughout the entire year.
Working and living in Antarctica introduces some unusual and interesting
experiences and opportunities. The unique situation requires personnel living in
Antarctica to undergo a degree of psychological adaptation to the isolated, confined
and environmental (referred to as ICE) circumstances experienced. Psychological
research gathered on personnel living in Antarctica and other unusual ICE
environments (for example; remote military posts, submarines and outer space
stations) have been clustered on the negative rather than the positive effects
(Mocellin, 1995). It is important that an accurate and balanced viewpoint on polar
psychological experiences is understood, not only for its appropriate application in
the Antarctic and Arctic, but also in analogous extreme and unusual environments
such as extended space flights and space habitation.
The objective of this paper is to review the growing body of literature that suggests in
addition to traditional psychological reporting of negative experiences for personnel
living in Antarctica there are positive ones as well.",,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/13985",,"en","English",,"University of Canterbury",,"All Rights Reserved",,,,,"Is it really so bad?

range in length from 8-70 mm, weigh up to two grams and can live for up to six years.
The krill species in the Euphausiidae family are bioluminescent which means that
they can produce a strong blue-green light that is probably used for communication to
help them congregate the spawn.
Like other crustaceans, krill have a hard calcified exoskeleton which is divided into
three segments (see fig.1): the cephalon, thorax and abdomen. The head and thorax
are fused into a cephalothorax. Generally the head has five segments, the thorax has
eight and the tail has six. Usually each segment has a pair of appendages, but

"17030","10092/13758",,"Lamers, Machiel",,,"2006","Tourism in Antarctica has increased steadily over the last two decades and established itself
as a legitimate Antarctic activity. Since 1991 the Antarctic tourism industry has self-organized
in the International Association of Antarctic Tour Operators (IAATO), imposing a wide range
of operational and environmental procedures on its members. The Environmental Protocol,
adopted, ratified and implemented domestically by the Antarctic Treaty Parties in the 1990s
set out the environmental protection of Antarctica from all human activities, including tourism.
Some Treaty Parties expressed concern but tourism was not considered a priority issue
between 1994 and 2000. Since 2001 the question of additional measures has received
closer attention at the Antarctic Treaty Consultancy Meetings. Recently, additional measures
have been taken with regard to a number of tourism issues, among them site-specific
guidelines for a number of frequently visited tourist landing sites (Bastmeijer & Roura 2004,
Crosbie 2005).
Alongside the political debate, from 1990 until recently an impressive body of academic
literature has developed about the desirability, implications and manageability of tourism in
the fragile, pristine and extreme Antarctic environment. A limited number of empirical
scientific studies into the impacts of tourism on Antarctic biota and ecosystems have also
been carried out (Stonehouse & Crosbie 1995, Naveen 2000). Within this lively academic
debate, environmental impacts and risks of tourism have played a central role.
This paper is a review of a number of academic papers that were published in the period
from 1990 until recently. In this paper, I will assess the environmental risks and impacts
presented in these papers and discuss some of its limitations and complications for
academic research. Implications for management and regulation will be largely left out of this
discussion. I would like to note that this review is based on a limited number of research
papers and is by no means complete. Before moving towards the main discussion of this

exploitable mineral reserves has become more and more important. This increasing
demand has put pressure on non-renewable resources, which was first recognised in the
1970’s and early 80’s.
Increasing demand and lack of secure supply from mineral rich countries such as South
Africa and Russia, led the Antarctic Treaty Consultative Parties (ATCP) to agree to
negotiate a minerals convention. This convention was merely to regulate mineral
resources and hence prevent Antarctica from being exploited by an unregulated
scramble. The negotiations for such a mineral convention, known as the Convention on
the Regulation of Antarctic Mineral Resources Activities (CRAMRA), took six years as it
was difficult to find a common nominator. The final document was open for signature in
1988, however soon after, Australia and France refused to sign the convention they
helped to negotiate. Instead they proposed that the ATCP should agree on
environmental standards and regulations, which would prohibit mining. After a further
three years, the Madrid Protocol was adopted, which banned mineral activities in
Antarctica for 50 years.
This review will investigate what the controversies between the different parties were
during the six years of discussion and investigate what were the underlying motives for
France and Australia rejection of CRAMRA. It further comments on the fact, if

quantities of ice from the interior into an ocean basin or withhold ice supply to the
major ice shelves has major implications for the stability of the West Antarctic Ice
Sheet (WAIS) and oceanic thermal and saline circulation. Accurate prediction of the
future stability of the WAIS depends on an understanding of mechanics of their flow
and the intrinsic and extrinsic environmental controls that turn it on and off.
This review presents some of the main issues arising from the intensive investigation
of the Ross Ice Streams, the most dynamic element within WAIS and discharging
40% of its ice into the Ross Ice Shelf. It discusses ice stream significance;
distinguishes between the Ross Ice Streams and other Antarctic ice streams; presents
contemporary knowledge of ice stream morphology and dynamics, factors controlling
ice streaming and ice stream velocities, spatial and temporal variations in ice stream
behaviour and mechanisms of ice stream flow. Finally, it looks at the implications of
recent mass balance measurements and recent work indicating a flow regime between
those of the ice streams and the interior ice sheet.
The impression gained is of a continually evolving body of research characterised by
an accumulation of knowledge but lack of consensus. The literature is riddled with
contention, contradictory results, areas where knowledge remains sketchy, and
conjecture. Undoubtedly advances in remote sensing technology will advance
understanding, but more information is required on the variability in sedimentary
properties over the bed of an ice stream: investigation of Palaeo-ice streams could
provide a complementary and more accessible source of such information. Which

"17050","10092/13758",,"Evans, Sherrie-Lee",,,"2004","The term “cultural resource management” includes prehistoric and historic sites, any
material recovered from these sites, and places or areas of historic or religious
significance. Cultural resource management involves the preservation and recovery of
cultural resources that might otherwise be threatened by vandalism or construction
(Fagan 1996 p.156). In this review, cultural resources are taken to include the
archaeological record, which is the result of site formation processes - the processes
of people and nature that create – in the landscape- evidence of the cultural past. This
evidence, consisting of isolated artefacts, artefact scatters, monuments, sites and other
vestiges of human behaviour including rubbish dumps, is called the archaeological
record (Fagan 1996 p.650).
An examination of cultural resource management in the Antarctic is limited to the
recent past, the domain of historical archaeology, since there is no record of
prehistoric or indigenous occupation in Antarctica.
The review has focussed on the status of the management of the non-built
environment – essentially archaeological deposit, isolated artefacts and artefact
scatters. There is an existing, comprehensive literature on the management of the huts
of the “Historic Era” which is easy to access. The heritage significance of these huts
has been identified and accepted by the Antarctic Treaty members, as evidenced by
their designation as Historic sites under Annex V of the Madrid Protocol (1991).
While, there is continuing debate over how best to conserve individual huts,
professionally qualified archaeologists and conservation architects are involved in the
development of conservation or management plans for their continued management
by identified agencies (for example Godden Mackay Logan 2001, Downie & Smellie
2001, TAE/IGY Hut Project Team 2001, AHT 2003 and Liddle 2001).
The situation with regard to management of archaeological deposit in Antarctica, in
particular where it has not been associated with one of the historic hut precincts, is a
different matter. An area of potential conflict has developed, over the recognition of
archaeological deposit as cultural resource rather than rubbish, with the adoption of
Annex III of the Madrid Protocol. Annex III contains provisions for waste
management and removal, which are a potential threat to the conservation of
archaeological deposits in-situ.
The International Polar Heritage Committee (IPHC) has expressed concern recently
that “there is no recognised way of defining what an “historic site” is and much
significant historic material is under threat because its historic value is not
accepted.” (IPHC 2001)
The IPHC has adopted as a guiding principle for its own work that:
1
“all evidence of previous/finished human activity in the polar areas has a
potential significance for the documentation and understanding of the history
of these areas and should be expertly assessed with an eye to possible
designation as a cultural heritage site before being altered or removed.”",,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/13987",,"en","English",,"University of Canterbury",,"All Rights Reserved",,,,,"The current status of cultural resource management in the Antarctic",,"Electronic Thesis or Dissertation","Science","University of Canterbury","Postgraduate Certificate","Postgraduate Certificate in Antarctic Studies","College of Science, University of Canterbury","ucresearchrepository@canterbury.ac.nz",,

 The United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) has frequently debated the involvement 
 of the United Nations (UN) in the Antarctic over the last twenty years. In the 1980s and 
 early 1990s, UN members were openly divided on the future of the Antarctic Treaty 
 System (ATS).12 Non-Antarctic Treaty Parties (non-ATPs) continuously challenged the 
 authority of Antarctic Treaty Parties (ATPs) to manage the Antarctic and argued that the 
 ATS should be replaced by a new structure under the auspices of the LIN. During this 
 period, ATPs refused to participate in UNGA debates on the 'Question of Antarctica' and 
 resolutely countered the arguments put forward by non-ATPs.3 Despite ATPs efforts to 
 ensure that the UN's role in the Antarctic remains limited and marginal, the UN has 
 acquired a role in Antarctic affairs. UNGA debates on the 'Question of Antarctica' have 
 increased awareness in the international community about the Antarctic and arguably 
 increased the transparency ofthe ATS. 
 This paper reviews the relationship between the ATS and the UN since the early 1980s 
 and considers what the relationship between the two parties will be like in the future. To 
 analyse the relationship between the ATS and the UN this paper is divided into three 
 parts. Part one details non-ATPs' criticisms of the ATS during UNGA debates and the 
 arguments put forward by ATPs to counter non-ATPs' condemnation of the ATS. In 
 particular, this part focuses on whether non-ATPs' criticisms are still valid. Part two 
 briefly outlines the challenges the ATS is facing and needs to address in the next ten 
 years. Part three examines whether the ATS or the UN is in a better position to deal with 
 these challenges. In essence it is argued that the ATS is the appropriate body to manage 
 the Antarctic in the future.",,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/14032",,"en","English",,"University of Canterbury",,"All Rights Reserved",,,,,"United Nations and the Antarctic Treaty System",,"Electronic Thesis or Dissertation","Science","University of Canterbury","Postgraduate Certificate","Postgraduate Certificate in Antarctic Studies","College of Science, University of Canterbury","ucresearchrepository@canterbury.ac.nz",,

These lakes have captured the attention and curiosity of both the scientific community and the public (SCAR, 1999 (A)). Major interest lies in the biota, geology, age and formation of the lakes and other secrets that the lakes may contain within their icy waters and within their sedimen layers. The largest of these lakes, Lake Vostok, is a remarkably large lake which lies far beneath the East Antarctic ice sheet. In September 1999, a workshop was held in Cambridge to develop a science plan for the exploration of the lake. The workshop considered the possibilities for scientific research and concluded that the lake systems would hold valuable scientific information. In the workshops supporting materials, The Antarctic and Southern Ocean Coalition (ASOC) considered the question ' 'To drill or not to drill"". The focus of this literature review will be on this question. This issue is important to the future of Antarctica's environment as it relates not only to Lake Vostok, but also to other subglacial and surface Antarctic lakes. Firstly, this report outlines the background of the Lake Vostok discovery and some of the special features of the lake. The report is then divided into two sections. One section deals with reasons for drilling Lake Vostok. This part will examine the benefits of drilling Lake Vostok for interested parties, for other Antarctic lakes systems and international drilling in general. The next section discusses why drilling should not take place. It will deal with the environmental and ethical reasons for not drilling Lake Vostok. This section will also look at the possible impacts of drilling Lake Vostok for other drilling programs in the Antarctic. Through this literature review, an assessment will be made of whether drilling impacts can be minimised adequately for it to proceed and whether drilling should take place on ethical grounds.

 millions of years. These lakes have captured the attention and curiosity of both the 
 scientific community and the public (SCAR, 1999 (A)). Major interest lies in the 
 biota, geology, age and formation of the lakes and other secrets that the lakes may 
 contain within their icy waters and within their sedimen layers. The largest of these 
 lakes, Lake Vostok, is a remarkably large lake which lies far beneath the East 
 Antarctic ice sheet. In September 1999, a workshop was held in Cambridge to 
 develop a science plan for the exploration of the lake. The workshop considered the 
 possibilities for scientific research and concluded that the lake systems would hold 
 valuable scientific information. In the workshops supporting materials, The 
 Antarctic and Southern Ocean Coalition (ASOC) considered the question ' 'To drill 
 or not to drill"". The focus of this literature review will be on this question. This issue 
 is important to the future of Antarctica's environment as it relates not only to Lake 
 Vostok, but also to other subglacial and surface Antarctic lakes. Firstly, this report 
 outlines the background of the Lake Vostok discovery and some of the special 
 features of the lake. The report is then divided into two sections. One section deals 
 with reasons for drilling Lake Vostok. This part will examine the benefits of drilling 
 Lake Vostok for interested parties, for other Antarctic lakes systems and 
 international drilling in general. The next section discusses why drilling should not 
 take place. It will deal with the environmental and ethical reasons for not drilling 
 Lake Vostok. This section will also look at the possible impacts of drilling Lake 
 Vostok for other drilling programs in the Antarctic. Through this literature review, 
 an assessment will be made of whether drilling impacts can be minimised 
 adequately for it to proceed and whether drilling should take place on ethical 
 grounds.",,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/14055",,"en","English",,"University of Canterbury",,"All Rights Reserved",,,,,"The Subglacial Lake Vostok: To drill or not to drill?",,"Electronic Thesis or Dissertation","Science","University of Canterbury","Postgraduate Certificate","Postgraduate Certificate in Antarctic Studies","College of Science, University of Canterbury","ucresearchrepository@canterbury.ac.nz",,

century, or from around 1895 until the First World War. During this period the economic
focus of exploration shifted to one of 'geographic and scientific discovery'�, typically by
'national land based exploring expeditions'� (Ferguson 1995: 5).
For women, however, it could be argued that their 'Heroic Era' did not begin until the end of
the 1940s, and continued into the 1970s. This is the era of female 'firsts': the first women to
work in Antartica, to visit the South Pole, to traverse the continent on foot, and to travel as
tourists. Unlike the first 'Heroic Era', this one is characterised less by the physical challenges
posed by the natural environment than by the man-made barriers of masculine and

low-chlorophyll (HNLC) environment where there is an excess of
macronutrients but little primary productivity (Wadley, Jickells, & Heywood, 2014). This
is due to the deficit of iron in this region as iron is a limiting micronutrient in
phytoplankton growth (Nicol et al., 2010). There have been many studies that have
examined this area and experimented by injecting iron into the waters. These identified
that artificial fertilisation significantly increases biological productivity (Joos, Sarmlento,

Williamson et al., 2012; Martin et al., 2013). This leads to an increase in the
sequestration of atmospheric CO2 as the phytoplankton utilise the dissolved carbon in
the ocean water during their enhanced photosynthetic rates. These artificial fertilisation
experiments have been considered as a long-term method to reduce the anthropogenic
atmospheric carbon, however, based on the current literature, the risks of damaging the
surrounding environment (ocean acidification, anoxic waters, nutrient deficit, and
greenhouse gas emission) exceed the potential benefits. To be able to consider artificial
ocean iron fertilisation as a method for carbon sequestration there must be much more

Japanese territory. And the Article II section (e) clearly mentioned that the Japan's
renunciation of all claims related to Antarctica. Next, the historical record of first Japanese

Lieutenant Shirase Nobu and it was privately supported. There are several books and

with Christchurch as the gateway city. Fuel and other supplies arrive in the late summer by
ship. People and supplies are delivered throughout the year by air, mainly in spring, when
large wheeled aircraft can land. Liquid transport fuel, heating needs and electricity
generation are mainly supplied by AN8 aircraft diesel fuel. This is expensive, produces
carbon dioxide when burned and has environmental consequences if spilled.
Considerable progress has been made at Scott Base in terms of fuel efficiency, heat
conservation and renewable electricity generation from wind. However, more can be done.
This review considers possibilities described in the literature and on the web with respect to:
1. Liquid transport fuel savings, especially for flying to and from Christchurch. Replacing
New Zealand's fifty year old Hercules C-130H turboprops with modern technology
offers the greatest step forward. An extended aircraft range could wholly or partially
avoid the need to refuel in Antarctica, with significant safety benefits as a bonus.
2. More wind-powered electricity generation. This would benefit McMurdo more than
Scott Base. It would be a valuable contribution overall to the joint logistical pool.
3. The use of small-scale geothermal energy for heat pumps, if this is cost-effective.
4. Further passive energy saving measures at Scott Base, together with improvements
in the efficiency with which diesel fuel is converted into useful heat and power there.
5. The use of solar energy at the base and in the field. This is relatively minor, as solar
energy cannot be used for base-load needs, but the technology is advancing quickly.
Small 'demonstration' investments, as a test-bed for new technologies, may also have merit.
Although there are zero carbon dioxide emission summer-only stations elsewhere in
Antarctica, this is not feasible for the year-round Scott Base and McMurdo stations. The best
that can realistically be achieved is to improve fuel and other efficiencies, and to use
renewable energy substitutes which are cost-effective, environmentally acceptable, robust

images to wiggle and warp, such as the observable twinkling of a star in the night sky. Antarctic
astronomy, including the operation of the South Pole Telescope, located at Amundsen Station, can
largely overcome these problems. In taking advantage of the cold dark skies, these telescopes are
able to probe the deep reaches of space, in order to answer some of the fundamental questions
related to the universe, including the search for theoretical dark matter and dark energy. Other less
conventional astronomy related projects in Antarctica include the 'Ice Cube array'. This uses ultrasensitive
light detectors, buried over a mile deep in the Antarctic ice sheet, to detect high-energy
neutrinos that were created by the most violent events in the universe, which allow astronomers to
visualize distant cosmic events by detecting the neutrinos they create. Other scoping studies have

climate change since the late 1970s, the sheer complexity of attempting to quantify and
model potential rises mean that it remains unclear by how much sea levels will rise, at
what rate, and where it will impact most. This uncertainty has meant that many policy
makers have been unwilling to expend the political capital and resources to take action to
counter potentially disastrous -but uncertain -affects. Uncertainty fuels inaction. The role
of the Antarctic contribution to sea level rise is critically important because, out of all the
contributions to sea-level rise, Antarctic melting has the capacity to greatly affect sea
levels. It is already happening in a number of areas, and some models project that melting
in Antarctica could accelerate over this century. Should this come to pass, many poorer
countries may not have the funds or information to respond in time, as making decisions
and finding resources can take decades. To some extent, further research, better data and
sharing of knowledge about the contribution of Antarctic melting to sea level rise will
help address uncertainties. But policy makers also need to appreciate that, owing to the
nature of the system studied and the available sources of data, complete certainty or
consensus within the scientific community may not be possible, and hard decisions will
need to be made. This review considers the science of and the ongoing debates about

off the glaciers in the Amundsen Sea in the West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS)'�and how
this information is conveyed to policy makers. It finds that even though much progress

in increasing investments in Antarctic ice sheet research to feed into the next IPCC
Assessment Report 6 in five years time. This research should aim to reduce the variance
within the scientific community on the issue of WAIS melting, but also help policy
makers determine a level of uncertainty at which they would be willing to act, given the
risks involved of a possible dynamic response in the WAIS rapidly increasing sea-level
rise beyond our capacity to respond. The alternative for the world's scientists, policy

great adventure'�? Was this a tragedy in which
'Courage, determination, and the highest sense of duty were defeated in
the worst weather of the most savage climate in the world. No men could
have endured more: none ever set a nobler example of heroism and
devotion.'� (Du Garde Peach 1963:50)
Or was the real tragedy 'that neither Scott or his men needed to die!!'�:
'Unfortunately he lacked originality and lost his common sense so early in
the expedition that he repeated mistake after mistake. Finally he would
listen to no one and became blind to reality and in doing so killed his men.
There is no doubt the blame for the disaster rests squarely on Scott's
shoulders.'� (Reaney 2010:127)
The way Scott and his expedition have been portrayed over the past hundred
years has changed dramatically. This critical review traces the portrayals of Scott
from 'hero to fool'�, and reasons for the changes through to the current
rehabilitation of Scott's reputation and recognition of his long term legacy.
Debates have emerged over the years resulting from these changing perceptions
and different accounts taken of the cultural, political and economic contexts of
Scott's time. The rise, fall and more recent restoration of Scott's heroic image is
charted.
The period of the review spans the heroic era of exploration to the present day. It
draws from selected books, diaries, reviews, journal articles, press, film and

goes back several centuries, with sightings of a Terra Australis Incognita,1
 however most of
the discovery and exploration of the continent has been done in the last century.
Expeditions were sent down not just to conduct scientific work and explore, but also to claim
land. The territorial claims where performed by sticking a flag in the ground and claiming it
for your king and country, but were these continuances of the colonial hunt the only reason?
The naming of mountains and areas shows affiliation, but were personal acts the driving
force? Many of the early sightings are not reliable because they were made by chance when
drifting off course. So is a sighting or 'first'� discovery enough to make a claim?
Before the Antarctic Treaty was negotiated in 1959 there were 7 countries claiming a piece of
the continent. Acknowledgements of the different claims were not set, bringing forward the
reasons and causes behind the claims. Was there political influence and focus on international
cooperation? Was it a strategic game of resources or a matter of honour and glory?

countries by the Madrid Protocol. This report addresses threats to the native biota that alien species
present, particularly those with invasive characteristics. Historically, protection against alien species’
invasion has been achieved through increasingly rigorous and effective quarantine inspection
procedures of people and cargo leaving for the territory. In recent years, monitoring has been
recognised as important for identifying those species which slip through inspections, and there is
increasing recognition of the need to formulate effective and unified response plans.
This essay discusses these issues generally in the context of continental Antarctica, and goes on to
relate them to specific needs identified as relating to New Zealand’s Scott Base. Invasive species
from viruses, bacteria and algae to plants and small animals are considered. Recommendations are
made for improvements in prevention, monitoring and response to preserve the Ross Island region
in particular. These include suggestions for improving the Base’s reporting system for insect
incursions, for effective monitoring of plants in the base vicinity and beyond, and the need for a fulltime
biosecurity post. Key issues are identified that may form the basis of a comprehensive response
plan, including the methods by which alien species can be reliably identified, how they should be

dealt with, and whether herbicides and pesticides might be acceptable solutions to curb their
spread.

software (ArcGIS and Tephra2) these hazards were mapped and have been
shown to pose little direct threat to Scott Base due to its location on the
Peninsula and distance away from the volcano. In a strong eruption scenario
with high winds, the simulated tephra fall showed it reaching Scott Base with a
maximum thickness of 0.05-1 cm. Despite this negligible impact on Scott Base,

intrinsically interlinked. Whales are considered a taonga species, and represent abundance, richness
and were regarded as chiefly animals. The relationship to whales has changed over time, early Māori
welcomed stranded whales as a gift from Tangaroa utilising the meat, oil and bones for a range of
uses.
Whaling influenced this relationship in that with the arrival of the European whaling, whale
carcasses became more readily available which iwi around the shore stations made use of, Māori were
also employed on whaling ships and interactions increased with Pakeha as the whale populations
decreased. For the last 50 years one of the key drivers in the changing relationship is legislation. The
Marine Mammals Protection Act 1978 regulates the cultural access and use of the stranded whales.
As a consequence of these factors and multiple other influences, the significance of ‘Ko ahau te
tohorā, te tohorā ko ahau’ (I am the whale, and the whale is me) has evolved into a more disconnected
relationship and this saying can (in most cases) no longer be used in the way it was intended. Many
Māori do not have the connection to the environment that once was vital to survive in New Zealand.
Currently there is the risk that this matauranga will be lost with the older generations. But there is
hope that the important relationship with the whales is not lost, that with the increased awareness

activities are subject to Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) prior to project approval. Consideration of
cumulative (past, present and future) impacts is mandated under the Protocol for projects assessed at the
higher levels of Initial and Comprehensive Environmental Evaluation only. The Antarctic Treaty System is
challenged with developing a strategic approach for ensuring cumulative impacts are addressed at all levels

been minimal to date, attributed largely to inconsistent practices, inadequate exchange of information, the
absence of structured assessment methodologies or just uncertainty amongst proponents and regulatory
authorities regarding what to address. Nineteen Comprehensive Environmental Evaluations were reviewed
and results generally indicated minimal consideration of cumulative impacts over and above a definition of

Funding decision processes have progressed from a bottom-up curiosity-driven approach to a more

International collaborations have been important throughout. Collaborative organisational interactions
dominated decision-making during the early period. Bureaucratic politics is most evident in post-1991
organisational changes.
Since 1991, the focus has been on coherent strategies and the outcomes sought. Funding criteria are
well defined, and contests are widely accepted as fair and transparent. Reviews and evaluations have
been positive. The quality of the research strategies has improved in terms of defining outcomes
sought and appropriate measures of progress towards them.

The transportation, use, storage and disposal of these energy sources has however, in some cases,

more readily recognizable than anywhere else on the planet. This is due to the absence of any native

It is now widely accepted amongst the scientific community that the main cause of
climate change is from human activity – primarily the burning of fossil fuels. Our current
lifestyle patterns, which we seem intent on increasing as a mark of success will have a
dramatic, undesirable effect on the environment in which our great grandchildren will
be expected to live.
Reflecting the its obligations under the Antarctic Treaty and the Madrid Protocol,
Antarctica NZ (ANZ) statement of intent shows its commitment to “…the highest
standards of international environmental stewardship through our efforts to minimise
environmental footprints...”. Due to the remote and extreme characteristics of the
Antarctic environment, human activity in Antarctica is highly dependant on fossil fuel
for both transport and generation of essential utilities such as water, heat and
electricity.
The volume of fuel consumed is dependant on the activities we do (how we do it and
how much we do of it), and the mechanical efficiency in which we do them. Largely, the
efficiency aspect is based in technology, which is financially, logistically and
environmentally expensive to improve and often yields relatively small incremental
improvement. Improvements from the activities we do and how we do them is much
more flexible, can yield fast results, may be surprising cheap to obtain and yield a
relatively large return.

extent are not yet well understood, though several potential drivers have
been identified, such as the increased input of freshwater into the
Southern Ocean due to basal melting of ice shelves around Antarctica.
Previous studies have found seasonal links between the growth and decay
of sea ice and the minimum and maximum input of freshwater from basal
melting of ice shelves. A variety of observation and measurement
techniques have been used to quantify freshwater input from basal
melting, and remote sensing techniques have been recognised as an
important opportunity for large-scale monitoring of the surface freshwater
balance both in the Southern Ocean and globally. In this study, data
products from the European Space Agency’s Soil Moisture Ocean Salinity
(SMOS) mission are investigated to highlight the strengths and
weaknesses of ocean salinity data in detecting salinity and freshwater
trends around the Antarctic continent and adjacent to the ice shelves.
Several limitations were noted for both data products, including the
rejection of data during pre-processing stages due to sea ice presence,
land contamination, and too few data measurements. The reliability of
data adjacent to the continent and sea ice is therefore substantially
reduced, and would benefit from additional investigation into lower-level,
unfiltered data that retains the rejected gridpoints, whether this is
available through SMOS or a similar mission such as the National
Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)’s Aquarius mission.
However, initial analyses of Level 3 data demonstrated seasonal patterns
that correspond with modelled projections of minimum and maximum
freshwater input from basal melting of ice shelves, and indicating that
there could be a role for remote sensing in monitoring these patterns and,
in conjunction with direct measurements, exploring more closely whether
freshwater flux from basal melting of ice shelves is a significant driver of
increasing seasonal Antarctic sea ice extent. It is vital that biases in SMOS
data be addressed, or alternative data sought, to determine the extent to
which remote sensing can contribute to this research goal.",,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/14115",,"en","English",,,,"All Rights Reserved",,,,,"Can SMOS Ocean Salinity Data Detect a Link Between Increasing Antarctic Sea Ice Extent and Freshwater Flux from Basal Melting of Antarctic ice shelves?",,"Electronic Thesis or Dissertation","Science","University of Canterbury","Postgraduate Certificate","Postgraduate Certificate in Antarctic Studies","College of Science, University of Canterbury","ucresearchrepository@canterbury.ac.nz",,

2014). There are no terrestrial vertebrates in Antarctica, and faunal communities consist of
invertebrates: Diptera (two species of midges), Acari (mites), Collembola (springtails), Nematoda,
Rotifera, Tardigrada and Protista (Convey, 2007; Hughes, 2010). Antarctica is the only continent in
the world to have a flora that is dominated by lower plant groups, predominantly Cryptogams (Peat
et al., 2007). There are no trees or shrubs in Antarctica and the diversity of terrestrial vegetation is
restricted to five major plant groups: phanerogams (seed-producing flowering plants); and the spore
producing Cryptogams bryophytes (mosses and liverworts), lichens, algae and blue-green algae or
cyanobacteria (Coenraads and Koivula, 2007; Lewis-Smith, 20071
). Cryptogams play a vital role in
the energy flow and nutrient cycling of the Antarctic terrestrial ecosystem. They also provide viable
habitat for invertebrates, and can influence soil moisture and temperature regimes, e.g. moss
communities create their own microclimates (Bednarek-Ochyra et al., 2000). Fungi, algae and
cyanobacteria also play a central role in the stabilisation of mineral soils, which are a key
prerequisite for the secondary stages of plant colonisation and community development (Wierzchos,
2007).",,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/14117",,"en","English",,,,"All Rights Reserved",,,,,"An Introductory Guide to the Flora of Antarctica",,"Electronic Thesis or Dissertation","Science","University of Canterbury","Postgraduate Certificate","Postgraduate Certificate in Antarctic Studies","College of Science, University of Canterbury","ucresearchrepository@canterbury.ac.nz",,

community. In this report, ICP-MS was used to analyse a sample of feathers from both Adélie
Penguins and South-polar Skuas from Cape Royds, Ross Island. These two Antarctic bird species are
important parts of the southern ocean ecosystem and food web, and understanding the heavy metal
accumulation in these predators gives insight into the whole system of the Ross Sea. The results from
this paper show that there was a significant difference in the concentrations of Al, Hg, As and Mn
between the Adélie feathers and the Skua feathers (P<0.05). The higher trophic feeding level of the
Skua explains the bioaccumulation of the Hg and As, but these two metals are also highly toxic to
organisms in high levels. Aluminium levels were significantly higher in the Adélies and this is
attributed to unsuccessful washing of the feathers and the fact that the Adélies spend more time on
the ground were the Aluminium is able to stick to their feathers. Manganese is not as toxic as the
other metals and is of less worry, but again, this was seen in higher levels in the Adélies and again
could be attributed to possible higher levels in the soil of Cape Royds. Other metal results are

"17184","10092/13759",,"Curie, Marcus",,,"2015","With the Antarctic Treaty implemented in 1959 human impact to Antarctica is partly regulated.
Antarctica is our Earth last almost pristine continent. In the first years the main focus was laying
on the fields of science and freedom, but environmental protection aspects came to an equal
level of interest over time. Not least this fact is shown by the implementation of the additional
conventions to the Treaty and the Madrid Protocol, which came into force in 1998 (Anon,
1998b). With Annex III to the Madrid Protocol of ‘Waste Disposal and Waste Management’ a
major field of human impact is covered. Every human activity which includes use of resources in
one way or the other creates waste, especially long-term activities. Science and presence of
humans in Antarctica are therefore responsible for waste creation in the pristine ecosystem.
Annex III of the Madrid Protocol provides in general that waste must be removed from Antarctica
and carried back to the home countries of the responsible parties to the Antarctic Treaty (Anon,
1998a). Further it is mentioned that waste disposal on land (landfill) or sea ice (when broke up
waste is drifting away) is prohibited, as well as open fires to burn waste (Anon, 1998a). All those
points are contributed to the protection of the ecosystem and to avoid harmful impacts of emissions.

The Protocol does not regulate the point what will happen with the waste when it is back in the
home countries. Therefore waste can be treated in a way of best state of the arts from a waste
management point of view (e.g. recycling, secured dumping…) or in one where there is a risk
that the waste influences the ecosystems of the home countries. Best state of the art techniques
in waste treatment and management are not applied in every country. The monetary factor is
crucial in this case, because new techniques are often expensive in implementation and application.
That is so although it reduces the possibilities of harmful impacts of the waste and hence
that safes costs of negative results in the future.
At Scott Base the current waste management applies waste collection, separation and partly
pre-treatment (e.g. glass, cardboard). The whole amount of waste (excluding waste water) is
carried back to New Zealand by ship at one time per year. There, in Christchurch, the waste will
partly further treated and leaded to recycling and landfill. Because of that waste management
there are two risks to nature. Every weight what is carried to NZ needs fuel and creates emissions
(e.g. CO2), and because a certain amount of waste goes to landfill there are risks of pollution
of ecosystems in NZ. Therefore it is advisable to assess the possibility of alternative waste
treatments, directly at Scott Base. In the case of this assessment it will be investigated how an
incinerator at Scott Base would change the situation. What are the advantages and disadvantages
with a focus on the three sectors of economy, ecology and social aspects? It must be
considered that there was a small time frame of just a couple of weeks. That limited the chance
to get final information from industry, because it needs time to design the best adjusted facility.",,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/14120",,"en","English",,,,"All Rights Reserved",,,,,"Assessment of Possible Incinerator Application at Scott Base - Can Thermal Waste Treatment an Alternative Option Compare to the Current Waste Management",,"Electronic Thesis or Dissertation","Science","University of Canterbury","Postgraduate Certificate","Postgraduate Certificate in Antarctic Studies","College of Science, University of Canterbury","ucresearchrepository@canterbury.ac.nz",,

on our planet, and elsewhere? Astrobiology encompasses and embraces multiple disciplines, and is
interdisciplinary in practice. The exploration of extraterrestial worlds begins at home. Antarctica is a

technology for robotic space missions. Europa, Jupiter’s icy moon, is a prime target for astrobiology.
Lake Vostok in East Antarctica is a powerful analogue for the liquid water oceans, and the possible
life that may exist beneath Europa’s icy shell. Studying extreme life in Antarctica reveals life as
fascinating and resilient, diverse, unique. Antarctica can also be used as a field site for designing,
testing and validating robotic technology to explore Europa, like the Europa Lander. Antarctica as
an astrobiology analogue is inspiring, and embodies curiosity, discovery, exploration and possibility;

respond very differently to ideas, policies or even identical data when it is framed in different ways.
To date most research on framing has focused on language.
The primary objectives of this research were to explore whether visual imagery presented in
combination with powerful written stimulus had any impact on: a) the degree to which people
believed Antarctica and the Southern Ocean were regions that should be preserved and protected
from irreversible damage (salience), and b) their propensity to financially support well-known, notfor-profit
(NFP) organisations that aim to protect and preserve Antarctica and the Southern Ocean.
Secondary objectives included whether visual framing influenced perceptions of: 1) specific threats
to these regions, 2) mitigation priorities, and 3) the effectiveness of taking various actions to protect
and preserve Antarctica and the Southern Ocean.
To examine these questions, we constructed five self-complete, on-line surveys that were emailed
to 15,929 currently inactive World Wide Fund for Nature (Australia) financial supporters.
Approximately 2% (n=307) were completed and returned.
Results from this study showed no statistically significant differences on the primary or secondary
measures. Whether this was due to the sample size being too small, the lack of variation across the
sample in key measures, bias or moderating factors being at play, or whether the visual frames
devised for this research were not potent enough, is unclear. Further research using different visual

"17197","10092/13759",,"Miles, Russell",,,"2014","On 25 January 2012, United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon
addressed the General Assembly on his Five-Year Action Agenda 2012-2017: ""The
Future We Want"". In his address, Ki-moon outlined a goal to forge consensus around a
post-2015 sustainable development framework and implement it. One of the action points
of this goal was to “work with UN Member States to make Antarctica a world nature
preserve”. Ki-moon’s statement is a recent addition to long-standing debates about the
proper use and/or protection of Antarctica. This paper reviews the history of these
discussions and the legal instruments and organisations that have been put into place to
govern Antarctica. In particular, the paper traces the evolution of the idea that Antarctica
should be protected and the varieties of protective frameworks and degrees of protection
that have been proposed. The paper uses the term “world park” to mean a legal
framework under which Antarctica would be completely protected from mineral and
other resource exploitation. The paper argues that establishing Antarctica as a “world
park” is needed for the comprehensive and long term conservation of Antarctica and its
wildlife, and reducing the direct and indirect human impacts on the continent and
surrounding oceans. At the same time, this measure would conclusively address the
ongoing question about resource use in Antarctica and remove the possibility of future
insecurity and conflict arising from this uncertainty—hence ensuring the Antarctic Treaty
continues to achieve its primary goal of maintaining peace and security. Although a UNmandated
“world park” would be desirable in this regard, an analysis of the context of
Ban Ki-moon’s statement suggests that his proposed “world nature preserve” would, in
practice, not be a “world park” but rather a mechanism to regulate the use of Antarctica’s
resources among UN member states. An alternative and more pragmatic pathway towards
greater protection of Antarctica, is to therefore build upon the opportunities that exist
within the Antarctic Treaty System (ATS). This paper argues that the ATS could build
upon the 1991 Environmental Protocol to strengthen environmental protection and
environmental security in Antarctica that moves it towards achieving the “idea” of a
world park. It could do this by bolstering the Committee for Environmental Protection,
reinforcing the ATS secretariat, and pursuing a concerted effort in international forums to
protect Antarctica from influences outside the direct control of Antarctic Treaty Parties.",,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/14132",,"en","English",,,,"All Rights Reserved",,,,,"Fortunes and Future of an Idea: The Designation of Antarctica as a World Park",,"Electronic Thesis or Dissertation","Science","University of Canterbury","Postgraduate Certificate","Postgraduate Certificate in Antarctic Studies","College of Science, University of Canterbury","ucresearchrepository@canterbury.ac.nz",,

“strains and sprains” are the major musculoskeletal injury. The trend from the data
demonstrated that “strains and sprains” were the dominant injury. This has resulted in
the professional development of the QSG= Quick Stretching Guide.
The project also answers the three overarching questions of comparisons between
BAS and ANZ and their Health and Safety. The questions being how are Health and
Safety and Risk managed by two different National Antarctic Programs (BAS and

It is therefore timely to engage students in Science concepts in the context of Antarctica.

Antarctica. This can be of concern in regards to the environmental and other impacts it may
have. This paper looks at adventure tourism, a branch of Antarctic tourism which has also
been growing. The definition of adventure tourism is discussed and this paper focuses on
land-based organised tourism and land-based independent expeditions. The unique impacts
of these activities to the physical, social and political environment are analysed as well as
the potential benefits. Although all forms of tourism will have some negative impact on the
physical environment, it is concluded that impact caused by adventure tourism is quite
minimal. In regards to social/political impacts, adventure tourism, particularly independent
expeditions can have a significant impact, both with the disruption to National Antarctic
Programs and commercial tour companies, financial burden, and the risk to human lives. It
is concluded however, that the benefits outweigh the negative impacts in this case, yet
focus still needs to be put on Antarctic tourism to ensure it stays this way.",,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/14140",,"en","English",,,,"All Rights Reserved",,,,,"Using Informal Online Resources to Investigate the Impacts and Benefits of Adventure Tourism on Antarctica",,"Electronic Thesis or Dissertation","Science","University of Canterbury","Postgraduate Certificate","Postgraduate Certificate in Antarctic Studies","College of Science, University of Canterbury","ucresearchrepository@canterbury.ac.nz",,

was found that, in a global context, Antarctica could be said to have a weaker sense of place than
long-inhabited countries, or it could just be said to be different. In assessing New Zealand’s place in
Antarctica, the decision to use interviews to collect data was revised to conducting an online survey
due to time constraints and in the interest of collecting as many responses as possible. Despite best
efforts very few responses were collected, meaning that the results of this research cannot be said
to representative and conclusions drawn from it not considered entirely accurate in this context. It

by students participating in the Postgraduate Certificate of Antarctic Studies (PCAS). This
is performed on behalf of Antarctica New Zealand (AntNZ) and, as a part of a wider
environmental impact assessment scheme, fulfils monitoring obligations under national
and international regulations. PCAS students have gathered a range of information for five
projects; a fixed point photo survey, a waste audit, visual assessment of ground
disturbances, vegetation monitoring, and litter surveys. A selection of these projects is
performed annually and the results and recommendations supplied to AntNZ. To date
there has been no compilation of data collected each year and therefore a lack of
meaningful results showing temporal trends. There has also been no administrative review
of the projects since the pilot in 2004/05 and the reports and recommendations provided
to AntNZ annually range in quality and utility.
This report compiles the data from the fixed point photo survey and visual assessment of
ground disturbance projects. A critique of each project is also included including
suggesting changes to project design in the future. The compiled fixed point photos show
little change in the Scott Base environment since 2006. The majority of the changes track
the movement of temporary storage around the base. This information is superficial and of
little use to AntNZ. It is recommended that the project include more photo points looking
away from Scott Base to track growth in the Scott Base footprint. To allow better
comparison of photos a database of original photos should also be established. Data from
visual assessment of ground disturbances has limited usefulness in its raw form. Location
of monitoring has differed each year and so analysis of temporal changes is not yet
possible. There has also been variation in the quality of observations in past years so the
assessment form has been changed to provide clear criteria for future observers.
Geographic Information System (GIS) software was used to analyse compiled data and the
maps created suggest that, as would be expected, disturbance decreases with distance from
Scott Base facilities and infrastructure. If this data is used as a baseline to monitor changes
over time, this project has the potential to effectively track cumulative impacts in the Scott
Base environment.",,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/14143",,"en","English",,,,"All Rights Reserved",,,,,"Compilation and critique of PCAS environmental monitoring fixed point photo survey and visual assessment of ground disturbance",,"Electronic Thesis or Dissertation","Science","University of Canterbury","Postgraduate Certificate","Postgraduate Certificate in Antarctic Studies","College of Science, University of Canterbury","ucresearchrepository@canterbury.ac.nz",,

"17231","10092/13759",,"Beer, Kate",,,"2011","The Southern Ocean or sub-Antarctic islands are broadly defined as the island
archipelagos falling between 30o and 60o south. These islands are greatly
influenced by their proximity to the Antarctic continent, but form a unique
bioregion. The islands are characterised by low species diversity, but with high
levels of endemism. They are also key breeding locations for Southern
Hemisphere seabirds.
Historically the sub-Antarctic islands have been isolated from human
populations so were late to be discovered and rarely visited since then. However
the islands were not immune to outside influence as first sealing industries
exhausted the fur and elephant seal populations, and second the early settlers
introduced non-native species that preyed upon island fauna and/or destroyed
vegetation and habitats.
In the present day, a number of these non-native species continue to
wreck havoc on the islands, and they are widely recognised as the single largest
threat to the biological integrity of the Southern Ocean islands. Other notable
threats are human visitation, wildlife disease, and climate change. Of course, all
these factors are inextricably linked, and impossible to consider in isolation. The
potential for pest and disease incursion increases in a warming world, and
increased tourism pressures in the Antarctic region mean there is also an
increased interest in visiting the sub-Antarctic islands.
Intensity of management efforts in the past thirty years has varied across
the island groups, with different governing bodies taking different approaches to
making and initiating management decisions. The global significance of many of
the islands has been recognised through designation as World Heritage sites.
Statutory management plans have increasingly been seen as crucial to guiding
island management outcomes, and now nearly every island group has a guiding
document of some sort. The most tangible management efforts have focussed on
ecosystem restoration through the eradication of non-native species, mostly
mammals. New Zealand has been a world leader in this area, particularly
regarding the removal of rodents from relatively large islands using aerial poison
drops.
In the past five years there have been calls to reconcile management of
Southern Ocean islands at an international level. Currently all the islands are
managed independently by the respective territorial governing body. For the
long term success of conservation management it is integral that island
managers are encouraged to work together and openly communicate about
management successes (and failures). Recent collaborations where New Zealand
staff have assisted on eradication projects elsewhere provide hope for this, and
since 2006 there have been two International Forums on the sub-Antarctic held
in Hobart, Tasmania, with a third to be held this year. The Southern Ocean region
is gaining recognition both in its own right and as an important place to study
and manage as an indicator of climate change and global systems health.
While examples are drawn from a number of island groups, the case
studies focus on the Australian islands of Macquarie and Heard/ McDonald; the
United Kingdom administered South Georgia, and the five New Zealand island
groups: Antipodes, Auckland, Bounty, Campbell, and Snares.",,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/14167",,"en","English",,,,"All Rights Reserved",,,,,"Conserving the forgotten latitudes: approaches to wildlife management on Southern Ocean islands",,"Electronic Thesis or Dissertation","Science","University of Canterbury","Postgraduate Certificate","Postgraduate Certificate in Antarctic Studies","College of Science, University of Canterbury","ucresearchrepository@canterbury.ac.nz",,

"17294","10092/13759",,"Fortune, David",,,"2006","In February 2001 David Given completed a Scoping Report for the Christchurch Botanic Gardens,
which gave details of a Gondwana Project [Appendix Three].
This outlined the proposals for an area of the Christchurch Botanic Gardens for a Gondwana
Section linking, particularly, the plants of the former southern continent.
Money has been set aside for the development of this area [shown in Appendix 1]. The final project
will involve many completely new plantings and the moving of several other plants, some
earthworks, a long time frame and new information displays. After an initial discussion with Jeremy
Hawker, Operations Manager, Christchurch Botanic Gardens and with Angus Allen, Plant Curator,
we decided on some practical, achievable goals to continue with the work of the late David Given.
The aim of this project is to set up some educational aspects for this Gondwana Project which can
be incorporated in the final display, taking into account that this will be a major project for the
Botanic Gardens. In particular it was decided to try and link different aspects of Gondwana and to
try and make the information available at different levels to the whole public as it is also near the
Children’s Playground. It is desired that children and adults gain knowledge and information as
they go through the Gondwana area display, as well as it being an interesting area with a wide
variety of different plants and displays.
Gondwana (“Land of the Gons” – a tribe in India 3
) was first named by Eduard Suess, an Austrian
geologist, describing some of the formations in central India which show typical developments of
shared geological features. This concept was further developed by a German scientist, Alfred
Wegener 1
. He envisioned a single great land mass Pangaea, consisting of a Southern land mass
Gondwana to the South and Laurasia to the north1 2 . His work was partly based on the physical
shape of the different continents “fitting” together, with western Africa fitting against eastern South
America.
The more recent evidence linking the different parts of the former Gondwana has come from
geological features, flora fossils and fauna fossils.
I have initially described some of these in the next three different chapters.
As the Botanic Gardens Gondwana plan is not yet designed or laid out, I cannot describe the
illustration methods and links for the different part of the project. These must be done with a
common system for all plants, materials and links when the project is more advanced.
The whole project should have a brochure with a map for people to follow and gain further
knowledge, if they wish. The material set out here is available to be inserted in the brochure when
further details of plantings, pathways and features are decided upon.
I have set out background knowledge, some of which will be transferred to the project brochure, in
sections 1, 2 and 3, followed by my suggestions for specific parts of the project.
In each case I have set these up electronically so they can be transferred to information boards, or
smaller information posts like the fossil connections and the botanic origins connections.
The aim was to create a series of such ideas, in consultation with Jeremy Hawker, that could be
used directly in the Gondwana project.",,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/14227",,"en","English",,,,"All Rights Reserved",,,,,"Gondwana Project for Christchurch Botanic Gardens",,"Electronic Thesis or Dissertation","Science","University of Canterbury","Postgraduate Certificate","Postgraduate Certificate in Antarctic Studies","College of Science, University of Canterbury","ucresearchrepository@canterbury.ac.nz",,

There can be no doubt though, that the metaphor of the city evoked by Shackelton, from the
crows nest of the Nimrod, as she steamed between the tabular ice bergs of the Ross Sea,
was vastly different from the cities we’ve come to identify with today. Over the last century
the notion of what constitutes an ‘urban’ condition has diversified and been vigorously
debated, and with this the meaning of ‘urban’ has changed. In spite of the transformation, it
would appear, at least to some extent, that Shackleton’s imagery captures the contemporary
condition no less appropriately than it did in 1908.
Over the course of the last century there has been progressive shift in the focus of urban
design theory, from buildings representing the primary form to an understanding and
appreciation of landscape as an exchange media and vessel for the various cultural,
ecological and economic processes that operate in and on the cities of today. Shackleton’s

Although reasonably productive, the bipolar nature of the organisation and the

regulation is required elsewhere to be truly effective. The need for regulation is clear,
studies have shown approach behaviour, sounds made, duration of stay, and position
in relation to other vessels, habituation responses, and many other factors can lead to
negative consequences for cetaceans. The Southern Ocean is deemed particularly
vulnerable, due to its central role in a large percentage of whale lifecycles and it has
been made a sanctuary under the International Convention for the Regulation of
Whaling (ICRW). However, there is no regulation applicable to the area other than
the industry guidelines. Although more stringent than the ideal guidelines set down by
the IWC and New Zealand’s Marine Mammal Protection Regulations 1992, the
significant expansion of the industry will not be conducive to keeping with its broad
environmental goals. Under the Antarctic Treaty System, the Environmental Impact
Analysis under the Environmental Protocol could be invoked. However, it is not an
effective tool to use for the nature of whaling operations. Instead, a new instrument is

I have spent quite some time at the
Scott Polar Research Institute in
Cambridge (SPRI) familiarizing
myself with material on Captain
Scott’s National Antarctic
Expedition (NAE) of 1901-4. I
started with documents directly to
do with my grandfather, Hartley
Travers Ferrar (HT), the expedition
Geologist, and moved on to other
material as I felt drawn to it. My
aim was to wander through the
archive, as it were, and let my
impressions settle before making
decisions about what, if anything, I
wanted to do with it all. Of course
the idea of a biography was always
there but I didn’t know if familiarity
would turn me away or bring me
closer. I wanted to do the PCAS
course to help with clarification.
This essay is the culmination of the
process so far.
Hartley Ferrar was the
youngest of the ‘Officers’ and as
such came in for a fair amount of
‘joshing’. His cabin was a small
one amid-ships, a placing which
underlined his position as a nonnaval
scientist, yet not part of the ‘men’ either; neither fish nor fowl. The cartoon of him as
Our Junior Scientist shows an awkward, unhappy youth. He had perpetual headaches on
Discovery which stayed with him the rest of his life.1
This was Ferrar’s first job after graduating and I shall return later to the
circumstances of the appointment (see page 7). He had been a champion sportsman at
school, winning cups galore and becoming Head Boy. At Cambridge he had been an
oarsman; the top of the tree. He was rowing at Henley when the news came through that
he would be going to Antarctica. Within a month of this peak experience he found himself
the unfledged new boy, an Irishman on what was effectively a Royal Navy ship, an unproven,
un-published, newly-graduated scientist packed off to the ends of the earth with
nearly fifty chaps who, even though one or two of the ‘men’ were younger than him, had
vastly more experience of the rough-and-tumble world of working life on a ship.",,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/14159",,"en","English",,,,"All Rights Reserved",,,,,"Paths are made by walking - the beginnings of a plan for a biography of Hartley Travers Ferrar",,"Electronic Thesis or Dissertation","Science","University of Canterbury","Postgraduate Certificate","Postgraduate Certificate in Antarctic Studies","College of Science, University of Canterbury","ucresearchrepository@canterbury.ac.nz",,
"17297","10092/13759",,"Mason, Anna",,,"2006","Fossil fuels are the predominant source of energy in Antarctica. Most Antarctic stations,
including Scott Base, are powered by conventional generator units and diesel boilers.
In addition to the atmospheric pollution produced by the burning of fossil fuels, there are
a number of environmental risks associated with transporting, distributing and storing
fuels in the Antarctic. Fuel usage is also becoming increasingly expensive as fuel prices
and transportation costs continue to increase.
Energy efficiency practices can help reduce fuel usage but serious reductions can only
really be achieved through the use of renewable energy. The potential for renewable
energy use in Antarctica is high, but further technological advancements are needed to
make large-scale renewable energy generation more practical for the Antarctic
environment.
Renewable sources such as wind and solar radiation, when used in combination with
conventional energy generation, can significantly reduce a station’s energy
requirements. For small-scale applications out in the field, renewable energy can
sometimes provide almost all of the energy needs.
Successful application of renewable energy on a large scale has been achieved by the
wind farm at Australia’s Mawson station, following a long investigation process. The
success of this application will hopefully encourage other Antarctic Treaty Nations to

supporting the proposal of secondary ingestion, and similar theories have been applied to the

"17221","10092/13759",,"Domaas, Christel",,,"2012","When thinking about Antarctica I imagine the image is of a vast, white continent at the
bottom of the world. It has breathtaking scenery that makes your mind wander, but it is also a
continent that—after being there—leads a person to reflect on themselves, on life and death,
past and present, and the future. Its stories are all over the landscape and follow a person
around like a shadow in the 24-hour daylight. It is a long time ago that the first men sat foot
on this continent. But the marks are still there, not only in the stories, but also in the
landscape; the first hut erected is still standing, and buried in the ice are many remains of
human impact.
It is interesting to ponder on how humans have behaved on the continent and to examine
whether and how their behaviour has changed over time. What has brought about these
changes and what does this mean for the future protection of Antarctica? This paper will chart
the evolution of changing behaviour towards the Antarctic environment from the early
position of its use value to today’s more environmental protection focus.
Today we have a framework of laws and regulations for the Antarctic continent and its
surrounding oceans, but it is only 20 years since the Protocol on Environmental Protection to
the Antarctic Treaty was adopted, and big changes have been made during the recent years.
Our understanding of this land and continent is completely different today than 100 years ago.
From being a white unknown, uncharted area, terra nullius/incognito, on the map at the turn
of the last century humans have explored, charted, claimed the continent and exploited it’s
marine resources. Our knowledge has increased, and is continuing to do so, not only about
Antarctic matters, but also about the Earth in general. Focus on the environment and our
behaviour has become a world issue. The environment is a fundamental element in human
pleasure and satisfaction even though human behaviour has environmental impacts that are
sometimes negative and destructive.
Legal requirements, emanating from the signing of the Antarctic Treaty in 1959, and added
regulations and measures to control human activity and change conduct in the Antarctic, are
elements that have shaped behaviour. But general public opinion and peer pressure have also
been significant parts of the process.",,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/14157",,"en","English",,,,"All Rights Reserved",,,,,"Antarctica and the importance of the environment - a rude awakening",,"Electronic Thesis or Dissertation","Science","University of Canterbury","Postgraduate Certificate","Postgraduate Certificate in Antarctic Studies","College of Science, University of Canterbury","ucresearchrepository@canterbury.ac.nz",,

is also the only continent with no known economically exploitable deposits and where no resources
have been explored by drilling (Rowley, Ford, Williams, & Pride, 1983). Its isolation and extreme
conditions have protected it to a large degree from the exploits of humans. In addition the
exploration and mining for minerals on the continent is illegal under the Antarctic Treaty System.
However, with the world’s growing human population and the growth of wealth within nations with
historically low levels of consumerism coupled with the possibility of future exhaustion of mineral
resources on the other continents it is possible that Antarctic may not always be so far from the
grasps of mineral prospectors in the future. This paper will have a look at what documented and
speculated mineral occurrences are in Antarctica and what their economic potential could possibly
be, so that we can make an educated guess about what the future could be for Antarctic minerals. It
will give a brief review of some of the more economically interesting mineral occurrences which are
known to occur on the continent and will try to give some idea of what the potential for
undiscovered resources could be. Concentrating mainly on copper, platinum and iron ore, as these
appear to have the best potential on the continent, this paper examines the world markets for these
minerals to try and get a feel for what the future may hold for metal supply and demand from these
markets. It will look at some of the difficulties and extreme costs which would be associated with a
minerals industry in Antarctica as these difficulties could possibly make the exploration for, or
extraction of minerals from the continent impossible. The idea is to look at the continents geological
potential versus its associated difficulties and by examining the expected future state of the world’s
resource markets to come to some conclusion about the future economic potential of Antarctica’s
minerals. This paper has not taken into account the legal framework surrounding Antarctic minerals

"17286","10092/13759",,"Mason, James",,,"2007","The provision of energy is one of the most important issues currently confronting the
global community as conventional fuel reserves are depleted; together with increased
demand from developing countries and the environmental impact of burning fossil fuels.
Consequently finding alternative energy sources and using conventional sources more
efficiently are a clear priority for the worldwide community.
 In Antarctica, the scientific bases are dependant upon imported fuel oil to maintain
operations and to provide a safe working environment. The primary uses of the fuel oil is
electricity generation, heating and transport ( both ground and air operations ). The cost
of importing this fuel into Antarctica is high and so are the risks involved in its supply
and distribution. Perhaps the greatest environmental threat to Antarctica from the
operation of these bases is from oil pollution. The inaccessibility of Antarctica makes the
cost of delivering fuel oil high, especially where bases are not accessible by sea.
Consequently it would be highly desirable to reduce the dependence of Antarctic bases
on fuel oil.
 Sustainable energy sources, such as wind and solar power, provide an opportunity to
provide alternative energy sources for Antarctica. Although the environment offers
significant engineering challenges for the implementation of such systems, the high cost
of present generation methods could make the implementation of renewable energy
schemes attractive from an economic, as well as environmental, perspective.
 Although solar energy is obviously limited in its application in Antarctica due to the
months of darkness, it does offer advantages as a supplementary power source at
permanent bases. Clearly base activity increases during the summer months and this leads
to an increased demand for power. If solar energy could fulfill some of this demand then
significant improvements in efficiency could be achieved. Although solar energy can be
harnessed in various ways, for example in heating, water production and electrical
generation, this report covers the application of photovoltaic1
 systems to generate
electrical power in Antarctica.
 South Pole Station provides a promising opportunity for the implementation of solar
energy since it is at the end of a complicated and expensive logistics chain for the supply
of fuel oil. The demands on the current system of logistical supply for fuel and generation
capacity are creating pressures on the existing infrastructure which favour the provision
of a supplementary power source.",,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/14220",,"en","English",,,,"All Rights Reserved",,,,,"Photovoltaic Energy at South Pole Station",,"Electronic Thesis or Dissertation","Science","University of Canterbury","Postgraduate Certificate","Postgraduate Certificate in Antarctic Studies","College of Science, University of Canterbury","ucresearchrepository@canterbury.ac.nz",,

is to create a framework that Gateway Antarctica can use in the future in order to have their

The study used content analysis methodology. It coded one hundred and five articles

that the most common Antarctic science and research reported were ‘climatological’,
‘glaciological’ and ‘geological’. The most common themes of the headlines and articles were
‘scientific research’ and ‘climate change/rising sea levels’ and this was done by applying the
news values of ‘dramatisation/sensationalism’ and ‘timeliness’ to the articles. The science was
most commonly framed by an event or an issue that was deemed important for public
knowledge.

fascinating topic for biologists. In the 19th century, first documentations of the
abundant marine life were revealed through the eyes of the first sealers. Those
expeditions further contributed significant information on the diversity and
distribution of Antarctic marine life (McClintock, Amsler et al. 2001). But despite
several expeditions, Antarctica was regarded as a 'terra incognita' at the end of the
19th century. The beginning of the 20th century, however, brought a change with
the departure of several scientific expeditions into Antarctic regions. While
geographical exploration and magnetic studies were of major importance,
biologists were eager to discover and study the marine life and its adaptations to
the Antarctic climate (McClintock, Amsler et al. 2001; Lüdecke 2003). Until today,
Antarctic marine biology has undergone major changes, but is still of major
interests for marine biologists, due to its extreme environments and importance in
the world's ocean cycles (Hempel 2007).
Six expeditions (Table 1), leaving into Antarctic regions at the turn of the 19th
century, were selected for this report and will be investigated for methods and
research areas of marine biology. These methods will further be compared to and
reviewed for their influence on modern studies in marine biology. A further aspect

opportunity to study marine ecosystem processes. The Weddell Seal Leptonychotes weddelli
resides in the Ross Sea, with breeding colonies in Erebus Bay, McMurdo Sound. The
Weddell Seal‟s life-history is well documented in the literature; females congregate in
„pupping colonies‟ along cracks in the sea ice and give birth to their pups in October. Since
the austral summer of 1968/69 every pup born into the Erebus Bay population has been
tagged and the tag number, sex, year of tagging, location, and age at tagging recorded,
creating a database containing datum for over 20,000 individual seals.
Weddell Seals produce one pup per year. The age at which first reproduction occurs is an
important life-history decision, mediated by several trade-offs. Age at first reproduction also
has potential impacts for fitness and reproductive output/pup production – a fact also well
documented in the literature. The Ross Sea has a history of exploitation; when permanent
research stations were established in McMurdo Sound, adult Weddell Seals in Erebus Bay
were harvested to feed resident dog teams. Additionally, in the year 2000 a large tabular
(~10,000km2
) iceberg named B-15, calved off the Ross Sea Ice Shelf, blocking the usual
advection of sea ice from McMurdo Sound until the winter of 2006.
Several earlier studies have documented the large scale effects that both harvesting and
iceberg calving had on the size of the Erebus Bay population of Weddell Seals, and the
effects on age at first reproduction, however, no studies have focused on pup production. This
study investigated pup production in the Erebus Bay population of Weddell Seals to
determine if harvesting pressure and iceberg calving affected the number of pups produced in
Erebus Bay from 1969 to 2009. The results of the current study illustrate that both harvesting
pressure and environmental disturbances (iceberg calving) affected pup production in Erebus
Bay. Pup production reached very low levels in the years that harvesting occurred but
increased following the cessation of harvesting in 1985. A similar trend was witnessed from
2000 to 2006 when the B-15 iceberg was blocking McMurdo Sound. Pup production
decreased between 2000 and 2006 inclusive, but rapidly increased once the effects of B-15
were removed. While harvesting of Weddell Seals no longer occurs in the Ross Sea, iceberg
calving still does. If this was to continue in the future, it is likely that Weddell Seal pup
production in Erebus Bay will be somewhat negatively impacted. Other Antarctic seal species
such as the Crabeater seal may be negatively affected also",,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/14169",,"en","English",,,,"All Rights Reserved",,,,,"Weddell Seal Pup Production in relation to harvesting pressure and the B-15 iceberg",,"Electronic Thesis or Dissertation","Science","University of Canterbury","Postgraduate Certificate","Postgraduate Certificate in Antarctic Studies","College of Science, University of Canterbury","ucresearchrepository@canterbury.ac.nz",,

might be the incidental effect of activities, such as maintaining a base and conducting scientific
research, or it could be the result of some form of accident. While Antarctica is considered among
the most beautiful places on earth, it is also unpredictable and dangerous. The terrain and weather
are particularly unpredictable, increasing the likelihood that accidents will occur. There have been
several well publicised accidents involving ships in Antarctica. These include the grounding of the
Bahia Paraiso in 1989 and more recently, the sinking of the M/S Explorer in 2007, spilling 600,000
litres of oil and 185,000 litres of diesel into the environment respectively.12 Paradoxically,
Antarctica is as vulnerable as it is powerful. The Antarctic environmental is well known to be slow
in recovering from disruption and as tourist levels swell, the number and extent of these disruptions
will increase, along with the general risk to the environment.
Continued activity there can only result in harm to this unique place, so it is crucial that
responsibility is distributed to pre-empt it by reducing the likelihood of its occurrence and take
measures to protect the environment when it does happen. It is this sobering thought that inspired
the creation of a liability Annex to the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic
Treaty. The main obligation established by the Annex is for Parties to ensure their operators take
responsibility for harm they cause to the Antarctic Treaty area (south of 60° South Latitude). The
Annex was adopted as a legally binding measure at the 28th Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting
at Stockholm on June 17, 2005 after 13 years of negotiation. It will not come into force until it has
been ratified by all 29 Antarctic Treaty consultative Parties3
, at which point it will bind all Parties.4
This paper sets out to examine how the Annex has evolved through the negotiation process and
what it will achieve when it comes into force. It begins by outlining the Annex in its current form
and history and context in which it was developed. It then looks specifically at the substantive
issues that needed to be resolved as well as the procedural challenges that slowed the process down,
requiring more than a decade of negotiation. It will also discuss the future, in terms of how further
guidelines might help in the Annex’s practical implementation, as well as the development of
additional Annexes.",,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/14208",,"en","English",,,,"All Rights Reserved",,,,,"The Longest Journey in the World: An investigation into the liability annex and its evolution",,"Electronic Thesis or Dissertation","Science","University of Canterbury","Postgraduate Certificate","Postgraduate Certificate in Antarctic Studies","College of Science, University of Canterbury","ucresearchrepository@canterbury.ac.nz",,

leading Antarctic gateway city. It will define what combination of qualities and
offerings are expected of the world’s best gateway to the ice and compare
these to what Christchurch is currently offering.
Initially the paper will explore the concept of a gateway city, and examine the
function and offerings of various gateway cities around the world, however, for
the purposes of this project the focus for the main comparison will be between
Christchurch and Hobart due to the close physical location and access to the
Ross Sea region. The final section will explore how “leading” can be qualified
and measured.
According to the Oxford dictionary a gateway is defined as “a settlement,
usually occupying a favourable commanding site, which acts as a link
between two areas”. However, it is now recognised that this gateway role has
grown as intermediate destinations for those people with an interest in
Antarctica.
This has been facilitated by the local and national governments who
recognise an opportunity for regional and economic development. Recent
economic impact studies recognise the financial gains with respect to the
supply function of the gateway cities and ports. For example, a recent
economic impact study in Canterbury estimates that Antarctic related activity
benefits the region to around $155.1 million per annum and creates
employment opportunities for 1256 people. (Saunders et al. 2007) According
to Hall and Johnston (1995) the economic and commercial exploitation of the
Antarctic has in the past tended to concentrate on issues such as fisheries, oil
and mineral exploitation but more recently tourism has been the focus.",,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/14209",,"en","English",,,,"All Rights Reserved",,,,,"Christchurch: the leading Antarctic gateway city?",,"Electronic Thesis or Dissertation","Science","University of Canterbury","Postgraduate Certificate","Postgraduate Certificate in Antarctic Studies","College of Science, University of Canterbury","ucresearchrepository@canterbury.ac.nz",,

expeditions set out to explore and open Antarctica to the world. Given New Zealand’s
proximity to the Ross Sea region of Antarctica, three of the heroic era expeditions
departed and returned to/from Antarctica from the port of Lyttelton, Canterbury, New
Zealand. As a result of the longstanding relationship with the people of Canterbury, the
province’s organisations such as the Canterbury Museum, Lyttelton Museum and
Antarctic Heritage Trust collectively house one of the world’s leading publicly accessible
artefact collections from this period of Antarctic exploration. A century on the public
fascination with the expeditions remains. The upcoming centenary of one of the most
famous of the expeditions, the British Antarctic (Terra Nova) Expedition 1910-1913, led by
Captain Robert Falcon Scott, provides unique opportunities to celebrate and profile the
expedition and its leader, a man who has gone on to become legendary in the world of
exploration. This paper identifies key artefacts associated with the expedition currently
held by Canterbury institutions which have been identified as potentially suitable for
public exhibition. Criteria was based on factors such as historical significance, visual
impact and their ability to be exhibited. The research undertaken reconfirms Canterbury’s
status as holding a collection of world leading artefacts relating to this period of history.

as a legitimate Antarctic activity. Tour operations in the Antarctic are predominantly ship
based but other market segments have developed as well, including land-based tourism
using aircraft. The development of permanent land-based infrastructures and facilities for the
accommodation of tourists in Antarctica has concerned academics for decades. Permanent
tourist facilities are believed to start a completely new chapter in Antarctic tourism, especially
in combination with an air link (Lovering & Prescott 1979: 99). Hotels, casinos, theme parks
and other forms of permanent land based tourism facilities often portray in the media as a
nightmare glooming at the horizon of near future in Antarctica (Mercopress 2004, Guardian
2006). However, apart from tourist accommodation at selected scientific stations and a
number of tented camps, no permanent, purpose built tourist facilities have been established
over the past half-century.
Recently the issue of permanent land based tourism has caught the attention of policy
makers within the Antarctic Treaty System. At the Antarctic Treaty Meeting of Experts
(ATME) on tourism and non-governmental activities in Tromso in 2004 New Zealand
proposed a prohibition of permanent land based tourism facilities, because it launches
questions on user rights, property rights and legal jurisdiction (Bastmeijer & Roura 2004:
780). During the last Antarctic Treaty Consultancy Meeting in Stockholm, June 2005, land
based tourism was on top of the list of issues to be discussed during the tourism-working
group. Countries such as New Zealand, Australia and Germany tabled working papers and
argued for a precautionary approach and the adoption of a prohibiting measure against the
establishment of land-based tourism in Antarctica. Other Consultative Parties did not share
their views and no consensus could be reached at this point (ASOC 2005b).",,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/14229",,"en","English",,,,"All Rights Reserved",,,,,"Permanent land based tourism in Antarctica: Nightmare on the horizon or unfeasible?",,"Electronic Thesis or Dissertation","Science","University of Canterbury","Postgraduate Certificate","Postgraduate Certificate in Antarctic Studies","College of Science, University of Canterbury","ucresearchrepository@canterbury.ac.nz",,

they spend a substantial part of their lives foraging in the marine environment. Foraging
is generally done alone and they feed on krill, squid and fish.
Seabirds make up 3% of the worlds bird species. There are 328 species of seabirds in four
orders. Spenisciformes is the penguins and there is 17 species in one family.
Procellariiformes is the albatrosses, shearwaters, petrels, diving petrels, and storm petrels

frigatebirds, gannets and cormorants and there are 61 species in five families.
Charadriiformes is the gulls, terns, skuas, skimmers and auks, and there are 128 species
in four families.
Seabirds live longer and breed later than the other bird types. Some albatross and petrel
species live for more than 60 years. Mortality rates are low in adults and offspring.
Many seabird species are threatened by human activities. This is mostly as seabird bycatch
through commercial and private fishing. Many of these species are at risk of
extinction, particularly the albatross, petrels and shearwaters. They are attracted to the
bait used by boats and get caught in the fishing hooks and lines. They are then dragged
down into the ocean where they drown. Seabird breeding sites are all threatened by
human activities. They are lost through increased human settlement and through human
degradation such as oil spills. Humans have introduced invasive animals such as rats to

Charged particles (e.g. from the Sun), such as protons, interact with the magnetic field of
the Earth and can be deflected by it. This effect is reduced at the magnetic poles. Still,
particles that enter the Earth’s atmosphere commonly do not reach its surface, as they are
slowed down by scattering and collisions. Therefore, most of their energy reaches the
Earth’s surface in the form secondary particles and photons (e.g. X-rays). As charged
particles are less deflected at the magnetic poles, an increase of ionising radiation dose
similar to what has been reported in aircrew, is expected at high (magnetic) latitudes.
Similarly, it is well known that UV radiation levels are raised in Antarctica, where the
atmosphere has been compromised. Measurements of UV and X-ray radiation levels were
conducted in Antarctica in December and January 2006/2007, in order to investigate the
relative intensities of both ionising and non-ionising radiation in the South Polar Region

radiation were measured, the TLD dosimeters used for X-ray measurements were found to

Early expeditions led by Scott, Shackleton and Mawson drew attention to the harsh
realities of living in Antarctica for extended periods and many of these men suffered
from diet-related problems, compounded by stresses already being experienced in
conditions of extreme cold and physical exhaustion (Taylor 1992).
Dietary shortfalls in energy intake and vitamins were common in many early field
parties, which affected the health of expedition members such as Lieutenant Evans
who died of scurvy on Scott’s 1910 Expedition (Cherry-Garrard 1951).
A sledging expedition led by Sir Douglas Mawson at the same time as Captain Scott’s
fateful return from the pole experienced dietary problems of a different nature, when
Mawson and his companion Mertz were forced to eat their dogs. They were afflicted

 involved in Antarctic activities is perhaps one of the main barriers for successfully 
 developing environmental cooperation in Antarctica. 
 Since the XXIII Antarctic Treaty Meeting (XXIII ATCM) held in Lima in 1999, some 
 steps have been taken to evaluate such cooperation undertaken by Consultative 
 Parties, especially since 1998 when the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the 
 Antarctic Treaty (known as the Madrid Protocol) entered into force. Official 
 documents concerning this issue have subsequently been presented and debated in 
 the Antarctic Consultative Meetings. In 2002, during the Warsaw Meeting, the ATC 
 Parties decided that this subject would be discussed more thoroughly in the 
 Committee on Environmental Protection (CEP) annual meetings.

Permanent removal of HNO3 can occur if the ice crystals become heavy enough for

ozone destruction commences. As the sun’s activity increases the PSC ice crystals begin
to melt and release HNO3, which is converted into NO2 via photolysis which converts the

investigation has been made of the feasibility of locating Antarctica meteorites by use of
magnetic and/or electromagnetic means, as commonly used in other areas of geophysics.
It is found that Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) is a promising candidate for detection of
solid bodies buried within the ice to at depths around 1m, and would thus be an effective
approach to locating meteorites at the bottom of cryoconites. The expected detection
limits of a GPR system has been calculated for the conditions expected in Antarctic
meteorite stranding sites with cryoconites, and a study of the optimum instrument
configuration was performed.
For meteorites very near to the surface, such as under a thin cover of snow, GPR is
limited by surface clutter. Magnetometers are proposed as a more effective detection
method, and an initial look at the important parameters of a magnetometer-bases system
was undertaken to determine if further study is warranted in that area.
The advantages and disadvantages of GPR is discussed, and compared to the
effectiveness of the current visual detection method. While it is concluded that the GPR
systems (and potentially magnetometer) will allow the detection of large numbers of
meteorites that are currently going unnoticed, it is also noted that the search efficiency

As Hillary Clinton observed at the opening of the Antarctic Consultative Meeting in

“The Antarctic Treaty stands as an example of how agreements for one age can serve the
world in another, and how when nations can work together at their best the benefits are
felt not only by their own people but by all people and by succeeding generations… the
treaty is a blueprint for the kind of international cooperation that will be needed more
and more to address the challenges of the 21st century, and it is an example of smart
power at its best”.(1)
However, at 50 years of age the Antarctic Treaty System (ATS) is showing signs of stress
and its days as a viable system appear fraught with challenges from new players on the
international scene and imperilled by increasing demands on ever-decreasing global
resources.
At 50 the ATS is operating in a global climate that is vastly removed from the context in
which it was born as a pragmatic answer to the problems of that time.
That the ATS failed to address the issues of the time, rather shelving them in the
expectation of buying time and the hope that they would work themselves out, is at the
heart of its dilemma.
The problems then, as now, are the question of ownership of land (sovereignty) and the
question of exploitation of the land (resources).",,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/14183",,"en","English",,,,"All Rights Reserved",,,,,"The Future History of the Antarctic Treaty",,"Electronic Thesis or Dissertation","Science","University of Canterbury","Postgraduate Certificate","Postgraduate Certificate in Antarctic Studies","College of Science, University of Canterbury","ucresearchrepository@canterbury.ac.nz",,

specifically informed by materials available in the Canterbury district of New
Zealand. It draws on fresh resources now accessible in the public domain in
the antipodes, and from a private collection held by the family of physicist,
Louis Bernacchi.
A central source for this work is the original journal of Louis Bernacchi, (for
most of 1902) that resides in the manuscripts collection of the Canterbury
Museum, Christchurch. (Bernacchi 1902)
Letters and documents in the possession of Bernacchi’s granddaughter, a
resident of Lincoln, also in the Canterbury district, further inform this research.
This collection has only recently been acquired and my preliminary analysis
(over two days in early 2008) is the first made by a polar historian. The
collection may have gone unread for almost a century. It is extensive and has
yet to be fully catalogued and annotated. Section 1 of this paper provides a
brief history of Bernacchi in order to set the context and to rectify some oftenrepeated
biographical errors.
There are some letters written from the ice by Louis to his close brother
Roderick that support my reasoning. Bernacchi’s correspondence with
messmates upon the return of the Discovery inform my opinions about the
measure of success of the expedition and provide clues regarding expedition
management. There is also a significant body of (mostly brief)
correspondence with central figures in British polar circles of the early
twentieth century. These sources expand our knowledge of character and
personality of expedition members of the Discovery.

Captain Robert Falcon Scott’s last expedition set off to gather penguin eggs from Cape
Crozier, at the eastern end of Ross Island in Antarctica. Fresh embryos were needed to
prove the then current theory that the primitive emperor penguin was a link between birds
and dinosaurs, and specifically that feathers had evolved from scales. The Emperor
penguin is the only Antarctic creature to breed in midwinter: hence the need to travel in
the worst conditions the continent has to offer.
The men very nearly died. They travelled the 70-odd miles from Cape Evans to Cape
Crozier in almost complete darkness, and in temperatures so cold that their teeth cracked.
They lost their tent, essential to keep them alive, in a blizzard, and by a miracle found it
again. The voyage is recorded dramatically in “The Worst Journey in the World”, written
some years later by Cherry-Garrard and regarded as one of the best adventure books of
all time

. A somewhat more sober account is presented by the diaries of Dr Edward
Wilson, the leader of the expedition.2
 Conditions were so bad, and supplies so low, that
the men were able to visit the penguin colony only once, and returned with three eggs.
Sadly these eggs, for which “three human lives had been risked three hundred times a day,
and three human frames strained to the utmost extremity of human endurance”,3
 were to
do little to advance scientific knowledge.
Wilson and the expedition’s third member, Henry “Birdie” Bowers, died the following
summer on the way back from the South Pole.

be found in the most arid of deserts: the frozen, inhospitable lands of
Antarctica. Here species manage to carve out niches and survive, even
flourish in their own unique way. The persistence of life on Earth is part of
what drives us to search beyond our planet. Just how constant is this
phenomenon we call life?
Investigations into the possibility of life on other worlds have no choice but to
start on Earth. In order to model extra-terrestrial biological systems scientists
must look to Earth-based systems for inspiration. Antarctica provides the
exobiologist with a wealth of information. Here can be found some of the
hardiest species living under the most extreme physical conditions on Earth.
The cold, dry desert regions of Antarctica’s Dry Valleys have been likened to
the harsh Martian surface. Ice covered lakes are havens of biological activity.
Could the same have been true on Mars as an atmospheric crisis led to
increasingly hostile surface conditions? Investigations into the ecological
niches occupied by Antarctic micro-organisms provide scientists with ideas of
where to begin looking for evidence of life on Mars.",,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/14226",,"en","English",,,,"All Rights Reserved",,,,,"Antarctica and the Martian Analogy",,"Electronic Thesis or Dissertation","Science","University of Canterbury","Postgraduate Certificate","Postgraduate Certificate in Antarctic Studies","College of Science, University of Canterbury","ucresearchrepository@canterbury.ac.nz",,

‘climate change’ is a term which sticks in the minds of people from all walks of life. Scientists have
proven that CO2 levels in the atmosphere are increasing due to anthropogenic activity, although it
remains uncertain just how much of an effect this increase may have in the future, due to the lag
time associated with the increase and the consequent response.  
Countless mitigation schemes have been put forward that could be used either to cut down the
amounts of CO2 entering the atmosphere, or alternatively remove significant amounts of CO2 using
the worlds natural carbon sinks. Terrestrial ecosystems are thought to be the largest sink, fixing 1 – 2
tonnes of carbon per km2 annually through photosynthesis (Myers and Kent 2005). In the past, it has
been assumed that oceans have a minor role to play in the carbon cycle, contributing only to small
carbon fluxes. It has since been proven that the ocean has the potential to hold up to sixty times
more inorganic carbon than the atmosphere (Bathmann et al. 2000). The ocean’s role in the carbon

last till a big mineral discovery is made – then it will be every man for himself.’

The right to mine in Antarctica is intricately tied to international law. As the different
states in Antarctica have differing and disputed status under international law, the legality of
mining becomes complicated. The “frozen” claims, while practicable in terms of running a
harmonious system, leaves a lot to be desired for legal clarity, as the legal status of the maritime
area is subject to a multitude of different interpretations. The over lapping claims of Argentina,
Chile and United Kingdom, and the unclaimed area of Marie Byrd Land Only adds to the
difficulty of applying the typical international rules to the Antarctic.
The seven Antarctic claimant states are party to UNCLOS. The United States helped
draft the Convention, but has not signed it. The US has not made a claim in Antarctica, however,
and in the event of the claims being tried, the US could feasibly attempt claim the entire
continent, as could Russia. The rights of these parties will be discussed in a later section. The
rights and duties surrounding the mining of the deep seabed will also be discussed in later
paragraphs, but the question of whether the law of the sea zoning is applicable in Antarctica must
first be canvassed.",,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/14206",,"en","English",,,,"All Rights Reserved",,,,,"The Legality of Marine Mining in the Antarctic Treaty Area",,"Electronic Thesis or Dissertation","Science","University of Canterbury","Postgraduate Certificate","Postgraduate Certificate in Antarctic Studies","College of Science, University of Canterbury","ucresearchrepository@canterbury.ac.nz",,
"17298","10092/13759",,"Newton, Nadine",,,"2006","The Blue Penguin (Eudyptula minor) belongs to the family Spheniscidae, a distinctive
group of flightless, pelagic seabirds that inhabit the Southern hemisphere. The
smallest of the penguin species, the Blue Penguin weighs approximately one
kilogram, stands around 40 centimetres tall (Stonehouse, 1975), and occurs naturally
in southern areas of cooler waters off Australia and New Zealand. Blue Penguins are
covered in dense waterproof plumage that ranges in colour from pale power-blue to
dark slaty blue-grey on the dorsal side, and white on the ventral side acting as a form
of counteractive camouflage.
There is ongoing debate as to the number of sub-species that occur within the extents
of E. minor. Some experts believe that the White-flippered penguin (E. minor
ablosignata) can be considered as a different species, not just as sub-species. These
penguins are characterised by the presence of a white margin on both the front and
rear sides of the flippers and paler plumage on their backs (Reilly, 1994).
The total population of Blue Penguins in Australia and New Zealand has been
estimated to be somewhere between 350 000 and 600 000 breeding pairs (Dann,
2006). Although numbers are believed to be stable, there are concerns of decreasing
numbers of breeding pairs in certain locations (Dann, 1992). The White-flippered
penguin in New Zealand has recently been listed as ‘endangered’ by the International
Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN), as the breeding population is measured
to be only 2,200 pairs (Davis & Renner, 2003) and is restricted to parts of Banks
Peninsula and Motunau Island off the eastern coast of Canterbury, New Zealand.
Threats to the Blue Penguin include predation by introduced species (predominantly
foxes and dogs but also cats and stoats in New Zealand) and, locally, human
disturbance through residential and farming developments (Reilly, 1994; Williams
1995). Perhaps the most detrimental influences however come from fluctuations in
natural oceanic changes. Reilly (1994), states that if large-scale oceanic changes take
place, there will be corresponding changes to fish populations, something that we can
not deter, especially if the commercial fisheries continue to target the main prey
species of Blue Penguins and exploit areas in which they forage.
In order to gain an accurate understanding of the long-term viability of the Blue
Penguin, it is necessary to look at the breeding biology and foraging behaviours
exhibited by this species. By investigating these aspects of the Blue Penguin, we can
also make detailed choices in regard to the captive management of the species.
This paper aims to detail the breeding biology and foraging behaviours of Eyduptula
minor, in Australia and New Zealand, with a more indepth coverage of the subspecies
E. minor albosignata. The information highlighted will be used to construct
some guidelines that may be considered when housing and breeding the Blue Penguin
in a captive situation.",,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/14231",,"en","English",,,,"All Rights Reserved",,,,,"Natural Foraging and Breeding Behaviours of the Little Blue Penguin Eudyptula minor Including Recommendations for a Captive Population.",,"Electronic Thesis or Dissertation","Science","University of Canterbury","Postgraduate Certificate","Postgraduate Certificate in Antarctic Studies","College of Science, University of Canterbury","ucresearchrepository@canterbury.ac.nz",,

global climate; and changes in shape and extent of the Antarctic Ice Shelf may be
diagnostic indicators of climate change. The recent recession of ice shelves around the
West Antarctic coastline has been subject to major scrutiny by glaciologists and the
media. This project aims to reveal the recent changes in area along the West Antarctic
coastline that have not yet been measured. This change detection was analysed, using
ENVI and ArcGIS software, around the West Antarctic coastline in 1997 and in 2001.
The most recent satellite image of Antarctica, Landsat Image Mosaic of Antarctica
completed in 2007, was compared to the Radarsat Image Mosaic of Antarctica (1997).
Measurements of changes in area revealed that retreat and break up of the larger ice
shelves (37,341.85 km2
) in the region was the most prominent change. The Ronne Ice
Shelf unexpectedly retreated the most, followed by the Ross Ice Shelf, the Northern
Larsen Ice Shelf and the Thwaites Glacier. Sea ice expanded by a total of 35,806.78
km2
. In addition, iceberg and ice shelf advance were investigated. The change
detection results closely correlate with climate change records taken from nearby
Antarctic stations. During the four-year study period the temperature increased by
one-degree Celsius. It can be concluded that ice shelves are an indicator of climate
change in the region.",,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/14211",,"en","English",,,,"All Rights Reserved",,,,,"Change Detection around the West Antarctic Coastline between 1997 and 2001 using Satellite Derived Images",,"Electronic Thesis or Dissertation","Science","University of Canterbury","Postgraduate Certificate","Postgraduate Certificate in Antarctic Studies","College of Science, University of Canterbury","ucresearchrepository@canterbury.ac.nz",,

 ways of further reducing our impact on Antarctica. Getting to Antarctica requires either air flight 
 or ship travel, both Of which involve large amounts of fuel consumption and the associated 
 release of pollutants into the environment. Hopefully with advances in technology more efficient 
 and cleaner engines and energy sources will reduce these. The same goes for base logistics 
 such as heating and local travel both of these again rely on fuel consumption diesel generators

 1.1 The Analysis 
 The Built Environment at Scott Base, Antarctica has evolved over time from a series of fairly rudimentary sheltering enclosures 
 in 1957 to the present day sophisticated yet simple building designs, incorporating technologically advanced structural and 
 mechanical systems. 
 This analysis focusses on the built environment in terms of the following themes: 
 • Contextualising the challenges of building at Scott Base 
 • Evolution of the Construction Techniques 
 • Evolution of the Construction Technologies 
 Evolution of Statutory Compliance for buildings at Scott Base 
 The analysis has involved, researching existing literature and documentary evidence, discussions with design consultants and 
 operational personnel ( in their official capacities) familiar with the Scott Base projects so that an evaluative Summary could be 
 effected.

"17354","10092/13759",,"Mackereth, Graham",,,"2000","A workshop on diseases in Antarctic Wildlife was held in August 1998 at Hobart. A report on the workshop was considered by the Committee for Environmental Protection (CEP II). The committee's response to the report was to agree to the formation of an open-ended contact group to report to CEP Ill on matters arising from the workshop. The terms of reference of the contact group were to diminish the risk of the introduction and spread of disease to Antarctic wildlife and to detect, determine the cause, and minimise the adverse effects of unusual wildlife mortality and morbidity events in Antarctica (Kerry et al, 1999). This document looked at these terms of reference and the recommendations Of the workshop in relation to the Ross Dependency. Part 1 of this document focused on practical steps to prevent the introduction or spread of unwanted organisms in the Ross Dependency. It was found that there were already a number of management practices to this end. Minor adjustments and education were recommended to further minimise the risks. Disinfection techniques were described in detail. Part 2 of this document examined possible disease detection techniques. Existing science and monitoring activities where found to provide some surveillance for high mortality events. It was recommended that this passive surveillance be formally organised to maximise the surveillance value of current activities. This would involve identifying indicators and a reporting structure. Active surveillance (surveys and serum banks) were discussed in detail. The organisation of a passive surveillance system was considered to be a higher priority than active surveillance. Part 3 of this document considered what could be done in response to an incident of mass mortality. It outlined a possible incident management system. It was recommended that a Co-ordinated Incident Management System be established for responding to high mortality events. A simulated response to a disease scenario was recommended as a science event to test the proposed incident response system. An investigation into wildlife mortality involves some risk and should be carried out by competent and trained personnel. Procedures for the safe transport of diagnostic specimens were described. A workshop on diseases in Antarctic Wildlife was held in August 1998 at 
 Hobart. A report on the workshop was considered by the Committee for 
 Environmental Protection (CEP II). The committee's response to the report 
 was to agree to the formation of an open-ended contact group to report to 
 CEP Ill on matters arising from the workshop. The terms of reference of the 
 contact group were to diminish the risk of the introduction and spread of 
 disease to Antarctic wildlife and to detect, determine the cause, and minimise 
 the adverse effects of unusual wildlife mortality and morbidity events in 
 Antarctica (Kerry et al, 1999). 
 This document looked at these terms of reference and the recommendations 
 Of the workshop in relation to the Ross Dependency. Part 1 of this document 
 focused on practical steps to prevent the introduction or spread of unwanted 
 organisms in the Ross Dependency. It was found that there were already a 
 number of management practices to this end. Minor adjustments and 
 education were recommended to further minimise the risks. Disinfection 
 techniques were described in detail. 
 Part 2 of this document examined possible disease detection techniques. 
 Existing science and monitoring activities where found to provide some 
 surveillance for high mortality events. It was recommended that this passive 
 surveillance be formally organised to maximise the surveillance value of 
 current activities. This would involve identifying indicators and a reporting 
 structure. Active surveillance (surveys and serum banks) were discussed in 
 detail. The organisation of a passive surveillance system was considered to 
 be a higher priority than active surveillance. 
 Part 3 of this document considered what could be done in response to an 
 incident of mass mortality. It outlined a possible incident management system. 
 It was recommended that a Co-ordinated Incident Management System be 
 established for responding to high mortality events. A simulated response to a 
 disease scenario was recommended as a science event to test the proposed 
 incident response system. An investigation into wildlife mortality involves 
 some risk and should be carried out by competent and trained personnel.

Statement on Tourism and Other Non-Governmental Activities in Antarctica.
(Appendix 1 ). Commentary by Helen Clark states that this occurred in response to
a review of New Zealand's interests, and that the new policy reflects not only
enduring interests, but accounts for emerging priorities both nationally and
internationally (Clark, cited Conte, 2004, p220).
The Director of Heritage Expeditions, the only New Zealand owned and operated
tourism business to Antarctica, suggested that the policy will significantly alter the
goalposts for New Zealand tourism operators in the Antarctic, and will have a
negative impact on New Zealand tourism in the long term (Russ, 2004).
Public policy analysis focuses on what governments do and why they do it. It is an
important tool in trying to unravel why policies are adopted, how they work, and to
evaluate their merit or worth (Buhrs & Bartlett, p3, 1993).
This review will cursorily trace the development of New Zealand's strategic
objectives in Antarctica over the past 20 years, with a particular focus on Antarctic
tourism. It will seek to understand the drivers behind the development of New
Zealand's policy on tourism in Antarctica.
A previous Graduate Certificate in Antarctic Studies literature review pointed to the
paradox between the ""tension in the values of stakeholders, often economic, and
that of environmental stewardship, which marks the discourse on the future of New
Zealand Antarctic Tourism management"" (Wouters, year unknown, p1 ).
This investigation raises an even more significant issue - it uncovers the risk that
Antarctic tourism may present to the Antarctic Treaty System and consequently, to
regional stability. This threat to New Zealand security appears to have been the

"17435","10092/13759",,"Fortune, Adrienne",,,"2005","Antarctica has an extremely harsh and unforgiving environment that excludes most life
forms. The air temperature is below freezing most of the year and strong winds
emphasise the extreme cold. There is also large variation in the hours of light and
darkness throughout the year. It is not a hospitable environment for the survival of plant
and animal species including humans. There is a limited amount of free running water
and 98% of the continent is covered in ice1
.
The conditions in the ocean are better than on the land. Although the conditions are cold,
the ocean is abundant with life as the water is warmer than the air temperature2
. The
water temperature remains comparatively constant year round. This is due to reduced
wind effect as much of the ocean around Antarctica is covered by ice forming a
protective layer. There are also large volumes of nutrients for species to feed on.
Due to the limited ice-free areas in Antarctica the niches for plants and animals are
limited. This is further hampered by the fact that some areas are more exposed to
extreme weather conditions, further reducing available habitat. There are two plants that
grow in Antarctica, Deschampsia antarctica (Antarctic grass) and Colobanthus quitensis
(pearlwort) (McGonigal & Woodworth, 2002; Rubin, 2000). Due to better conditions on
the Antarctic Peninsula these species are more common here than elsewhere in

question on the GCAS course application form is reproduced below:
2. Indicate !tow, 011 completion oftlte course, you intend to use the experience btfuture
postgraduate research, education, community work or in your career.
Since I work at HIT Lab NZ, perhaps we could see if we could put together some type of
interactive exhibit to help educate people on Antarctica.
With this background information in mind, the author was contacted by Nigel Watson
from the Antarctic Heritage Trust (AHT) at the beginning of the GCAS course. He
suggested a topic idea for the personal project dealing with virtually visualizing the
historic huts. Nigel is interested in providing ""virtual access to showcase the Antarctic
historic huts and the Antarctic 'heroic-era' legacy"" (Personal Communication, Watson,
2004). A GCAS 2001/2002 student conducted a literature review on the subject that did
a nice job of reviewing what was currently available on Antarctica at the time, various
technologies that are available, and suggestions on what could be done in the future to
create a much better virtual hut experience (Hyde, 2002). The author of this report
assumes familiarity with the terminology that was nicely explained in Peter Hyde's
literature review and would suggest reading it prior to this report if unfamiliar with any
terms mentioned. This report focused on what could be done in a museum setting and an
attempt was made to provide some actual Antarctic related samples that could be used to
pursue project funding. There is information about HIT Lab NZ (www.hitlabnz.org)
towards the end of the report but mention is made throughout the report on ways this
University of Canterbury lab could contribute towards a project such as this.
There are 34 historic interest sites in the Ross Sea Region that the AHT recognizes
(www.heritage-antarctica.org/index.cfm/default) under 3 different category
classifications. The AHTs main focus is currently on four of the huts and they are:
1) Cape Adare Huts, Northern Victoria Land
(British Southern Cross Expedition 1898 - 1900, led by Carsten Borchgrevink)
2) Discovery Hut, Ross Island, Hut Point
(National Antarctic Expedition 1901- 04, led by Commander RF Scott)
3) Nimrod Hut, Ross Island, Cape Royds
(British Antarctic (Nimrod) Expedition 1907 - 09, led by Ernest Shackleton)
4) Terra Nova Hut, Ross Island, Cape Evans
(British Antarctic Expedition 1910- 1913, led by Captain RF Scott)
For some more insight into the huts, refer to the GCAS 2003/2004 Syndicate report that
investigated the question whether the huts should be removed, repaired, or restored
(Evans et al, 2004). The authors of this report passed on a personal communication from
J. Heap about comments that were made in a case where an attempt was made to get
grant money. Questions where asked about who would actually get to see the huts
located in Antarctica and a discussion followed dealing with creating a Virtual Reality
experience so the general public would be included (Evans et al, 2004, p. 43).
This author's GCAS 2004/2005 Syndicate project report investigated the question
""Raising the bar for an International Polar Year 2007-2008, how much will this IPY raise
the bar compared to IGY?"" (available from Gateway Antarctica). The official website for
the International Polar Year (IPY) 2007-2008 can be found at: www.ipy.org. An
Education, Outreach, and Communication (EOC) Committee has been established for the
IPY. They have set up five target areas for education and outreach initiatives that include
school children, potential new polar researches, Arctic communities, the general public,
and decision-makers (ICSU IPY 2007-2008 Planning Group, 2004). Creating a Virtual
Antarctic experience for a museum to showcase during IPY would represent a perfect
time to get the message out about the historic huts. The huts could be part of a bigger
virtual world that included 3D-models of certain key buildings from Scott Base,
McMurdo, and the South Pole as well as key land formations such as Mount Erebus. The
IPY offers a perfect catalyst to pursue project funding as there are currently 29 nations
planning to be involved (as of January 2005). There exists the potential to put together a
traveling museum exhibition that would be experienced by several thousand people
during the timeframe that IPY is taking place. Not only would the message get out about
the Antarctic huts to the public but it also provides an opportunity to generate revenue.
A great deal of the project time went into working with software and trying to make small
demos. So in addition to the screen capture pictures in the report, there are also seven
places that refer to a movie clip (provided on a CD, places highlighted by a""*"" at the

for construction in the Antarctic. A case study of a current Antarctic
construction project, the construction of a warm store at Scott Base, is
employed in order to investigate this. The gross energy requirement (GER) for
the construction of the building was found to be 43.9 GJ/m2
. This is comprised
of the embodied energy of the construction materials, energy used in
materials transportation, energy consumed by humans and the direct energy
requirements of on-site construction. The GER for the warm store represents
114 years of operating energy at 690 GJ per annum.
The energy required for the transportation of building materials made up
78.9% of the GER. This is therefore the main area of focus for the
minimisation of the GER for future Antarctic construction. This can be reduced
through careful attention to the specification of light weight materials.
Currently the energy efficiency of buildings is thought to be increased through
the minimisation of operational energy costs. The energy consumed in
processing, manufacture, transport and construction is not considered in this
equation. In both the Antarctic and worldwide there is a necessity for the
adoption of life cycle energy in preference to operational energy as the
measure of building energy efficiency.",,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/14372",,"en","English",,,,"All Rights Reserved",,,,,"The Energy Cost of Antarctic Construction",,"Electronic Thesis or Dissertation","Science","University of Canterbury","Postgraduate Certificate","Postgraduate Certificate in Antarctic Studies","College of Science, University of Canterbury","ucresearchrepository@canterbury.ac.nz",,

"17436","10092/13759",,"Cameron, Anna",,,"2005","The mechanisms for the protection of the Antarctic environment have evolved and
progressed throughout the past century. Typically, the evolutionary path of these
conservation measures have developed and reflected the change in the mentality of
the Antarctic Treaty Consultative Parties. It is possible to identify three distinct eras
of protected area management within Antarctica. Firstly, the exploration era and the
associated seal harvesting. This era formulated, and can be acknowledged for the
protection of specific species. The Agreed Measures identified the adverse effects that
humans were having on the Antarctic environment and consequently established the
concept of habitat protection and the notion of Antarctic Specially Protected Areas.
The Protocol advanced the notion of protected areas and produced a regime that
rationalised this concept. The Protocol enforces the usage of Management Plans and
consequently has produced a system that is regionally focused.
Annex V of the Protocol deals with Specially Protected Areas. Article 4 of this
Annex is specific to Antarctic Specially Managed Areas. Currently there are four
ASMAs within the Antarctic environment. These consist of the McMurdo Dry
Valleys, Cape Denison, Admiralty Bay and Deception Island. These ASMAs are and

emphasis on the leadership development through a personal interaction with the challenging
conditions in this remote continent.
This study consists of two parts:
First part is a brief overview of the programme with clear explanation on the format of the
programme and the key elements and activities that will be carried out during the trip. A
suggestion on the schedule and the learning activities of the programme before, during and
after the programme will also be listed.
Second part of this paper is a feasibility assessment of the programme using the Strengths,
Weaknesses, Opportunities and Threats (SWOT) analysis approach. This assessment will be
based on the situation of HKU and the current education reform proposed by the Hong Kong
Education Department. The current situation of the Hong Kong economy will also be
considered as a crucial component of our discussion.
It is hope that this assessment will be use as a reference for the future development of the
Adventure Education Programme (AEP) of the Institute of Human Performance (IHP) of HKU.
It may also be considered as a preliminary investigation on the possibility of putting our
leadership education programmes on a higher profile in conjunction to the Education Reform
of the Tertiary Education in Hong Kong.",,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/14371",,"en","English",,,,"All Rights Reserved",,,,,"Feasibility Study: Adventure Semester in Antarctica, The University of Hong Kong",,"Electronic Thesis or Dissertation","Science","University of Canterbury","Postgraduate Certificate","Postgraduate Certificate in Antarctic Studies","College of Science, University of Canterbury","ucresearchrepository@canterbury.ac.nz",,

collated into a dataset. This data includes site observations (location, topographical position,
estimated glacial history and soil age), morphological observations (full pit profile
description), soil taxonomic classification, surface observations (weathering characteristics of
boulders), chemical measurements of the major anions (Cl, S04, N04) and cations (Ma, Mg,
Ca, K), electrical conductivity and pH.
An exploratory statistical analysis was performed on this dataset to determine which analyses
were appropriate given the format of the dataset, and its quality and quantity. Box plots were
used to study the variability of variables according to different groupings. Multivariate
analyses including a factor analysis, discriminant analysis, cluster analysis and machine
learning algorithms were all applied. Geostatistical analyses investigated the spatial
dependence of some of the observations.
Most of the variability analyses indicated little differences in the ranges of soil properties
between groups (weather stage, eco-climatic zone, taxonomic class, geological age). Where
there were differences some trends were obvious and others were unexpected. The
multivariate analyses did separate the pits and observations into groups that seem reasonably
sensible. Little spatial dependence was found. It is concluded that the Bockheim dataset is
sufficiently comprehensive for statistical analyses. The next stage in this work requires
pedological input to refine those analyses that either have results of interest or have the

grounding line position and ice properties. Although the rheology of ice is viscoelastic at tidal loading
frequencies, most modelling studies have assumed some form of linear elastic beam approximation to
match observed flexure profiles. Here we use density, radar and DInSAR measurements in combination
with full-Stokes viscoelastic modelling to investigate a range of additional controls on the flexure of the
Southern McMurdo Ice Shelf. We find that inclusion of observed basal crevasses and density dependent
ice stiffness can greatly alter the flexure profile and yet fitting a simple elastic beam model to that profile
will still produce an excellent fit. Estimates of the effective Young’s modulus derived by fitting flexure
profiles are shown to vary by over 200% depending on whether these factors are included, even
when the local thickness is well constrained. Conversely, estimates of the grounding line position are
relatively insensitive to these considerations for the case of a steep bed slope in our study region. By
fitting tidal amplitudes only, and ignoring phase information, elastic beam theory can provide a good
fit to observations in a wide variety of situations. This should, however, not be taken as an indication
that the underlying rheological assumptions are correct.",,"ROSIER SEBASTIAN H R, MARSH OLIVER J, RACK WOLFGANG, GUDMUNDSSON G HILMAR, WILD CHRISTIAN T, RYAN MICHELLE On the interpretation of ice-shelf flexure measurements.

Sometimes referred to as the ‘Forgotten Islands’, these island groups are among the most remote and hostile within New Zealand waters. Yet, as they harbour some of the country’s most unique biodiversity and contain some of the world’s least modified landforms, they were recognized in 1998 with the designation of World Heritage Area status. It is not surprising therefore that the Islands have long appealed to visitors wishing to explore and understand the Islands’ rich natural and cultural environments. Typically, fare-paying tourists arrive by sea in small- to medium-sized expedition-style cruise vessels, although in recent years, the number of small vessels, such as yachts and sail boats, has increased. The most recent Conservation Management Strategy (2016) proposes developing and implementing a visitor monitoring programme to determine the effects of visitors on the natural and cultural environment, as well as on the visitor experience itself. However, there is only piecemeal data published on visitor numbers (especially since the mid-1990s) upon which to base visitor monitoring, and there is only limited evidence regarding the range of possible impacts visitors may have, including direct and indirect impact on wildlife, soils, and vegetation. In order to address this gap in knowledge, this case study draws on stakeholder interviews (n = 4), and a range of secondary sources (including visitor statistics from the Department of Conservation, tour operators and other published works) to provide an overview and update on visitation to the Islands, including site-specific data, an assessment of tourist impacts, and how impacts are currently monitored and managed.",,"Stewart E, Espiner S, Liggett D, Taylor Z (2017).

as a systematic means of verifying that activities were conducted to minimise potential
environmental impacts. Among the rights given to Treaty members is that of mutual inspection,
whereby all sites and facilities including stations, vessels, protected areas and refuges are subject to

complex array of bodies that aim to ensure the sustainability of Antarctica. The
Antarctic Treaty’s primary aims are peace and science and it has a proud history
of achievement, but it must remain fit for purpose. The difficulty of operating
within its system is demonstrated through the case studies of extended
continental shelf claims in Antarctica and bioprospecting. This paper argues that
it is time for the Consultative Parties to address the core complexities of the
Antarctic Treaty: the issue of sovereignty claims, the paradigm for governance,
consensus decision making and to acknowledge the political nature of the
governance regime. It is proposed that, in order to overcome these issues, a new
deal is needed. This could be achieved through an assessment of the governance
structure of the Antarctic Treaty System by Consultative Parties in order to make
improvements and increase its effectiveness and efficiency. Regular “Meetings of
Parties” at a Ministerial level, facilitated by the Scientific Committee on Antarctic
Research, would see an increase of the effectiveness of the regime, underpinned
by scientific research. The collapse of the Antarctic Treaty System, without a
suitable alternative, would likely see a “free for all” to its resources by selfinterested

of those working in Antarctica are considered, as is the value of Antarctica itself. Antarctica is seen
to be one of the last wilderness areas of the world. This alone gives Antarctica intrinsic value. The
importance that this ecosystem has to the rest of the planet, as a driver of sea currents and
atmosphere, gives Antarctica a high value to all peoples of the world, especially to the scientists who
conduct research there. The values of all the stakeholders involved in Antarctic research are
important to consider, as they motivate the actions of the future.
A further perspective of the value of Antarctic research can be given by assessing the research
achieved. Although existing metrics have known flaws to consider, assessment of Antarctic research
has provided valuable information on trends in research, the productivity of different researchers,
organizations, and countries, and influence within the Antarctic Treaty System, (ATS). New
measures of assessing research can help broaden the scope of impact, and lead to greater
recognition of the value of the overall intellectual contribution of Antarctic research.
As there are a large range of stakeholders who have an influence on Antarctic research, it is
important to examine how each different set of values plays out in an Antarctic context. The values
which stakeholders hold influence governance decisions as well as defining the focus of Antarctic
research. They are therefore important to consider. Because of the large number of stakeholders
and the values at play, the whole system is dynamic.
This report also looks at the political worth and economic value of Antarctic research. Science and
collaboration are the currency of diplomacy in Antarctica. They serve New Zealand’s and many other
governments’ aims well. Especially for small nations, working within an effective rules-based system
such as the ATS is the best way of influencing others.
The main economic value added of Antarctic science generally is likely to be through helping to
minimise the impacts of climate and other human-induced global environmental changes. Marine
resources and tourism are also significant but mining land-based minerals is unlikely while the ATS
and its Protocols remain in force.",,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/14303",,"en","English",,,,"All Rights Reserved",,,,,"The value of Antarctic research",,"Electronic Thesis or Dissertation","Science","University of Canterbury","Postgraduate Certificate","Postgraduate Certificate in Antarctic Studies","College of Science, University of Canterbury","ucresearchrepository@canterbury.ac.nz",,

650,000km2 – an area equal to two percent of the Southern Ocean.
Approximately two-thirds of this area is covered by the Ross Ice Shelf. The region
is widely recognised as being the last ecosystem on Earth that is little affected by
human interference. The Ross Sea is home to a plethora of unusual, unique and
globally rare species; the area has high levels of biological diversity, productivity
and endemism, all of which suggest the area is worth protecting.
Historically, there has been some exploitation of the seal and whale populations
of the Ross Sea. More recently, the area has been subject to tourism, scientific
whaling, and commercial fishing for the Antarctic toothfish. Of particular concern
is the growing presence of fishing vessels taking part in illegal, unregulated and
unreported (IUU) fishing activities. The Antarctic toothfish has life-history traits
that make the species vulnerable to exploitation, and little is understood about
its breeding biology. IUU fishing is worrisome because it represents an unknown
level of extraction for a species that appears to hold a crucial position in the Ross
Sea food web.
Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) have been gaining popularity worldwide as a
management tool for protecting areas of special biological importance. Currently
it is difficult to create and manage MPAs in areas beyond national jurisdiction –
that is, the high seas – but for some areas, regional fisheries management
organisations exists. The Southern Ocean is one such place, where the
management falls under the auspices of CCAMLR, the Convention on the
Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources, and the associated
Commission. CCAMLR successfully created the first ever high seas MPA in the
Southern Ocean near the South Orkney Islands in 2010. We believe this sets an
important precedent for what could be achieved in the Ross Sea.
This paper presents three possible plans for creating an MPA in the Ross Sea.
Plan A would see the entire Ross Sea become a no-take area indefinitely. Plan B
would create a network of MPA sub-areas within the Ross Sea. Plan C would
create a management intervention in the form of a moratorium on all extractive
resource use (fishing, whaling, bioprospecting) in the Ross Sea for 30 years. The
role of CCAMLR and the relative merits of the three options are discussed.
Finally, some options are presented for how an MPA in the Ross Sea could be
enforced. The Royal New Zealand Navy has boats suitable for enforcement work
in the Southern Ocean; the Air Force already conducts surveillance activities, and
the future acquisition of an unmanned drone is another possibility. However the
most successful outcomes would be achieved via cooperative enforcement taken
by a number of nations with interests in the Southern Ocean.

warranted.

for regulation under the Antarctic treaty. It was found that the treaty is an apolitical document with no
exclusive title or duress under national or international regulation. That is, an area owned by no one
but managed by everyone. The Japanese Whaling Research Program states that sustainable use and
management of all marine resources should be based on proper scientific findings however, Japan’s
research can be difficult to access and to translate. Japan states they need to kill whales to find out
their age, diets and sex. But Australian and New Zealand scientists are using non-lethal methods to
do similar research without having to kill the whales. Their methods include obtaining faeces and skin
samples for diet and age respectively. The Australian branch of the Humane Society International
took the Japanese whalers to court due to a breach in the Australia’s Environmental Protection Act.
Following four years of deliberation the Federal Court awarded the Australians victory and issued an
injunction against Japanese whalers who were hunting in Australia’s claimed area. This injunction
however, has been largely ignored by Japan. The court case and its results placed strain on the
tenuous relationships under the Antarctic Treaty System. Adding further strain is Greenpeace who
consider themselves to be ‘leading’ the struggle against whaling. Greenpeace and other anti-whaling
organisations believe that the Japanese Scientific whaling program was invented to disguise the fact
that whales are being hunted for their meat. Prolonged deaths of whales are considered deeply
unethical by anti-whaling nations. According to the Japanese culture, whaling is considered a vital
part of national identity with historical importance dating back until at least the 12th Century.
Furthermore there are factions between different environmental groups, with organisations such as
Sea Shepherd believing more extreme action against whaling is necessary. Due to the issues of
protests over sovereignty, it would prove more beneficial to keep the Antarctic Treaty System intact.
The Treaty has protected Antarctica for the past 50 years, by managing national rivalry and territorial
disputes. An environmental stance would be more appropriate to protect resources from excessive
exploitation. International Whaling Commission Meetings goals are to maintain peaceful purposes in
Antarctica, protecting the Antarctic environment, ensure scientific freedom for research and
exchanges of information, and to finally create economic benefits for all. These goals could be
achieved by reaching out to the youth of Japan to take an anti-whaling stance to potentially unite
opposing beliefs of whale conservation and sovereignty.",,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/14321",,"en","English",,,,"All Rights Reserved",,,,,"Cessation of Whaling in Antarctic Waters - A Case for Regulation under the Antarctic Treaty",,"Electronic Thesis or Dissertation","Science","University of Canterbury","Postgraduate Certificate","Postgraduate Certificate in Antarctic Studies","College of Science, University of Canterbury","ucresearchrepository@canterbury.ac.nz",,

dependent on fossil fuel and diesel generators to satisfy power and heat, until the summer of
2010. To cover this demand, the fuel was bought from the bigger American station,
McMurdo, which is next to Scott Base. McMurdo receives fuel deliveries every two years by
a big tanker arriving at the station’s little port.
Having carried out investigations about wind energy from early 2005 onwards, the decision
for three wind turbines on Ross Island was made by Antarctica NZ in April 2008. This joint
project with the United States Antarctic Program (USAP) and Antarctica New Zealand is
predicted to save almost half a million litres of diesel, reducing the two bases’ fuel
consumption by 11%. (Vance and Shaw, 2008; IEE, 2008)
Following an environmental evaluation and the permission by the government three turbines
were installed in the season 2009/2010. An electrical grid was developed and installed to
connect the two bases so that both were connected, resulting in Scott Base and McMurdo
benefiting from the renewable energy source. The little wind farm was opened officially on
16 January 2010 and is now producing energy for powering the bases. Further projects are
predicted to receive up to 50% of the needed energy from wind are already investigated.
(Martaindale, 2006)
But a wind farm in Antarctica? The decreasing dependence on fossil fuels and the new
renewable green generators are strong arguments for these projects, but is Antarctica the right
place to use them? The Protocol on Environmental Protection (Article 3) of the Antarctic
Treaty recognises wilderness and aesthetic values as well as the conduct of scientific
research.. The wind turbines stand out more than the bases and can be seen from far in the
magnificent landscape. They also have to be anchored in the ground, which disturbs the
ground. Should there be a wind farm, or are these three turbines already too much? Can these
turbines be justified as a need for science? Or is it a necessary step-in becoming more
environmentally friendly in Antarctica? (Protocol on Environmental Protection, 1991)
These questions will be discussed in the following. Arguments for and against the wind
turbines will be explained as well as their suitability for Antarctica. The environmental values
and the purposes mentioned within the Antarctic Treaty documents will be regarded and
compared with turbines as a renewable energy source. Alternatives are considered and in the

Since then, CCAMLR has been the main governing body for the Krill harvesting
industry but management practices have changed as scientific research has
uncovered a basic lack of understanding of the effects removal of significant Krill
biomass would have on the ecosystem.
Political influences and technological constraints have been limiting factors for
the expansion of the Krill industry, resulting in season catches having not yet
reached the total allowable catch set by the CCAMLR. In fact Krill harvests have
not yet reached again the peak seen in the 1980s.
Increased market demand for Krill products in recent times has bought about the
re-emergence of the Krill industry and as interest in this fishery has expanded so
too has technology advancements and processing methods. The increase in Krill
Harvests that these technology advancements could bring, coupled with an

this process occur and what impacts this will have on the flora and fauna of the world.
In attempting to answer some of these questions one must look at areas of the planet where climate
change is currently having the most visible and significant impacts. The West Antarctic Peninsula is
currently one of the fastest warming areas on Earth and is experiencing significant and measurable
change to its climate and the species that inhabit this region. How this information is communicated
and portrayed to the world’s populations is therefore crucial to their understanding of climate
change, its implications and effects, as well as preventative actions that can be undertaken both by
the individual and as a country.",,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/14300",,"en","English",,,,"All Rights Reserved",,,,,"Antarctica and climate change",,"Electronic Thesis or Dissertation","Science","University of Canterbury","Postgraduate Certificate","Postgraduate Certificate in Antarctic Studies","College of Science, University of Canterbury","ucresearchrepository@canterbury.ac.nz",,

Ocean. The Southern Ocean contains features of exceptional ecological value and scientific
importance. It is one of the last great wildernesses of the world which has not yet been heavily
impacted by human activity. There is growing international pressure for the Convention for the
Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR) to provide more protection for
Southern Ocean ecosystems than the current Regional Fisheries Management Organisation
(RFMO) framework provides.
This report explores the use of MPAs as a management tool in the Southern Ocean. MPAs are
effective management tools as they promote conservation and recovery of fish stocks at the
ecosystem level. The success of MPAs in both near shore and high seas contexts were explored.
Near shore MPAs have ample scientific evidence of their success but it was concluded that high
seas have not been established for long enough to provide conclusive evidence of success. For
MPAs on the high seas to succeed they must be well planned, include adequate resources to
combat Illegal, Unreported and Unregulated (IUU) fishing and provide flexibility through adaptive
management. While CCAMLR is governed by consensus decision making, the key challenge in the
establishment of MPAs will be to balance the different agendas of conservation and exploitation
of the 25 CCAMLR Members. The solution most likely to gain consensus is a create a network of
MPAs in the Southern Ocean that incorporate a mixture of managed harvest and no-take areas.
We expect that by the end of 2013 if CCCAMLR Members will reach consensus on the Ross Sea
MPA Proposal, the Southern Ocean will then have its first large-scale, high seas MPA. This is an
important step in creating a network of MPAs that will protect and conserve the Antarctic marine

implemented as attempts to protect the Antarctic environment from human induced
disturbances. Historically these disturbances were of a scale that they could be managed via
regulations over fixed spatial areas.
Present methods for delineating boundaries for ecosystem protection, under the ATS do not
account for the natural migration and variation of ecosystems. Areas where changes occur
rapidly, such as ice shelves, clearly illustrate the limitations of the fixed aerial projection
approach.
Ecosystem management in Antarctica cannot be undertaken as a uniform approach. It
needs to be informed by the spatial and temporal scales, and physical attributes of the
ecosystems concerned. Strategies should be derived from both the natural and cultural
context of Antarctica.
We propose that ecosystem management principles could be derived from any number of
cartographic principles including longitude, latitude, network and elevational projections.
In addition, acceptance and recognition of dynamic natural edges is also key to effective
management. Managing human activity as part of the ecosystem is not separate to strategies
such as the temporal sequencing of visitation, minimising introduction of competitor
species, localised physical interventions and cultural engagement will all be important.
Integrating management across marine and terrestrial environments is also at the core of
the issue. The division between the administration of management in marine and terrestrial
ecosystems, whilst logistically easier to apply, does not assist in the development of an
integrated and creative approach to ecosystem management.
Currently the issue of consensus decision-making that underpins the ATS limits the
potential for future innovations in this area. Should climate continue to change as predicted,
the present system will need to be modified for the purpose of protected areas to be
realised. This report provides a stepping of point for that creative process when the

beyond areas of national jurisdiction has received increasing attention, there is
growing agreement that Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) should be considered

areas closed to certain fishing activities are proposed as a useful protective
measure within the framework of precautionary and ecosystem based
approaches, to reduce the impact of fishing on vulnerable marine habitats and

species, because of the use of non selective gears that potentially impact fragile

adequate international and regional frameworks for implementing spatial based

paradigms as a framework for discussing wilderness in general, and the Antarctic
wilderness in particular. It looks at the Utilitarian view of wilderness; the view that
wilderness is there to be used by man to ensure the greatest benefit for the greatest
number. In contrast it looks at the Deep Ecology view of wilderness. This view sees
wilderness as of intrinsic valuable, and human beings as just another part of the
ecosystem with no right to damage it for any purpose. According to this view, man
should get out of Antarctica and just allow the continent to be; to remain the last great
wilderness. Finally, it looks at Libertarianism; the view that the Antarctic wilderness only
has value in terms of its usefulness to human beings. This philosophy promotes private
ownership as the way to protect the wilderness.
The Antarctic Treaty System is then analysed in terms of these paradigms. It looks at
which paradigm shaped the Treaty, finding that it was largely informed by the Utilitarian
view. This changed in the 1980s when, with the failure of CRAMRA, there was a move
towards a Deep Ecology paradigm with its emphasis on the intrinsic worth of the
wilderness, and therefore the necessity of putting measures in place to protect it. This
approach has been consistent up until today. However, future commercial pressures on
the Antarctic wilderness may provide a catalyst to change this approach. These pressures
may come from tourism companies wishing to expand tourism in the region, from firms
wanting to carry out bioprospecting and from mining interests. This must result in a shift

how members of society cognitively approach the contentious issue of climate change and how

all factors influencing how an individual responds to the climate change message but rarely have they been

(i) good deep-water facilities for refuelling and re-provisioning ships;
 (i) an international airport close by; and
(i) local infrastructure developed to facilitate exchanges of commodities
and people.
For the purpose of this report, this definition is narrowed to include only those cities that
were signatories to the 2009 Southern Rim Gateway Cities Agreement: Christchurch,
Hobart, Cape Town, Ushuaia, and Punta Arenas (Statement of Intent Between the Southern
Rim Gateway Cities to Antarctica 2009). This agreement underscores a commitment by the
cities to cooperate and collaborate on Antarctic issues, such as science research, education
and outreach initiatives, logistical frameworks, and business and tourism opportunities
(Boekstein 2014). This statement of intent provides an interesting lens to analyse the
Gateway Cities’ cooperation and competition with one another, as it lays down an active
objective to work together.
By confining our analysis to these five signatories, we are excluding other cities that could
be considered Gateways under a looser definition. For example, China’s engagement with
Antarctica has dramatically increased over the last decade, as they built a third base at
Dome A and upgraded their other two stations (Brady 2010). Alongside this Antarctic
development, they built an Antarctic research and logistics base in Shanghai during the
Austral summer of 2008/09, which sees vessels departing for the Antarctic (Brady 2010).
Over the coming years, as the Chinese Government continues to increase Antarctic
spending and step up domestic focus on its Antarctic program (Brady 2010), Shanghai may
feasibly become a recognized Gateway City, but for the purposes of this report will not be

One can point to a number of cases of significant out-migration, as well as environmentally-induced partial and staggered community relocations, which are outside of “normal” migratory patterns. Furthermore, many traditional risk management and response strategies have been lost in the post-colonial era, due in part to today’s pre-eminence of “modern” strategies. This loss also applies to strategies of risk-sharing with traditional trading and kinship partners, who are now found across artificial international borders. It leaves exposed communities and specific vulnerable groups with fewer capacities to respond to extreme weather events and the (gradual but permanent and assured) loss of habitable land (as in the case of low-lying atolls and volcanic eruptions). The result may be the loss of shared social and cultural identities, spaces and meanings; the creation of a bifurcated, altered or hybrid identities.

impacts degrading performance. However, even the most e ective isolation systems are incapable of protecting equipment from building collapse. This study
investigates the use of floor isolation systems (FISs) as multi-functional structural units to mitigate both equipment accelerations and structure responses to
achieve desired building-system performance. These multi-functional FISs not only serve their traditional purpose (equipment isolation), but they are also
engaged to protect the primary structure under extreme earthquake loads by passively adapting to function as nonlinear dynamic vibration absorbers. In so
doing, this concept bridges the gap between equipment isolation and vibration absorption, yielding a novel adaptive passive seismic protective technique.
Simulation results indicate that multi-functional FIS can reduce equipment accelerations for small to moderate earthquakes, as well as deflections (drifts) of
the primary building over a range of disturbance intensities. Overall, multi-functional FISs are shown to enhance building-system resilience over a broad range

using numerical approaches. However, before simulations can be used in engineering practice,
much work is needed to confirm the robustness of models and simulation methods. This
requires a continuous effort on simulation validation through comparisons with data. We evaluate
the accuracy of simulations using quantitative metrics of physical meaning to both seismologists
and engineers. We show that validation results are significantly controlled by the
choice of the models, including crustal velocity models, attenuation models and parameters,
and source models. We focus our attention on the selection of the appropriate velocity model
by performing a large set of simulations for multiple past events in southern California, using
the different community velocity models available for this region. After identifying the model
that consistently yields the best possible approximations, we investigate the influence of different
attenuation viscoelastic models, and that of the definition of attenuation parameters and
quality factors, as well as the relative influence of point versus extended source models. We
concentrate on moderate events in the greater Los Angeles basin area for which there are
significant number of high-quality data. We analyze the results through quantitative goodness-
of-fit measures and shed light on the relative weight of these factors with respect to each
other, and how they influence validation results, and thus simulations as a whole.",,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/12800",,"en",,,"Quake CoRE","https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/legalcode","CC-BY 4.0 International",,,,,"Model Validation in Ground Motion Simulations for Southern California","Conference Contributions - Other",,,,,,,,,

The area has highly variable geology; in terms of dynamic site characterisation, the areas with thick organic soil, alluvium, and where basalt has been deposited over soft soils provide particularly challenging characteristics.
Auckland is assumed to have a low seismic hazard because of its tectonic setting away from plate margins and major known fault systems. Seismic sources with potential to cause significant shaking in Auckland are associated with the Hikurangi Subduction zone and the Taupo Volcanic Zone. Nearby seismic sources (E.g. Wairoa North Fault, 60 km away) have low activity rates, thus pose less of a hazard. There is also potential for a significant earthquake along an unidentified or off-shore fault, as there may also be large faults in close vicinity to the city whose seismic potential are unknown.

A wide range of experience and skills were represented and included people involved in current citizen science projects and scientists with interests in the potential of citizen science to address wider information needs. The energy and enthusiasm of the participants also reflected the high interest in this topic. There were two major workshop topics: preparation of a citizen science projects list for a national estuaries science and management summary, and an exercise to explore gaps and opportunities for citizen science to assist coastal science and management objectives in. Examples from both New Zealand and Australian helped to enrich the conversation and identify priorities for advancing these topics in the short to medium term. Outcomes of the workshop included: a list of citizen science projects currently underway in coastal and marine environments to add to the national picture of citizen science, identification of opportunities for progressing this area of work in New Zealand, a list of priority actions to undertake in the short-term.

"16243","10092/13511",,"Orchard, Shane||Hickford, Mike",,,"2016","The Canterbury earthquakes resulted in numerous changes to the waterways of Ōtautahi Christchurch. These included bank destabilisation, liquefaction effects, changes in bed levels, and associated effects on flow regimes and inundation levels. 

This study set out to determine if these effects had altered the location and pattern of sites utilised by īnanga (Galaxias maculatus) for spawning, which are typically restricted to very specific locations in upper estuarine areas.

Extensive surveys were carried out in the Heathcote/Ōpāwaho and Avon/Ōtākaro catchments over the four peak months of the 2015 spawning season. New spawning sites were found in both rivers and analysis against pre-earthquake records identified that other significant changes have occurred.

Major changes include the finding of many new spawning sites in the Heathcote/Ōpāwaho catchment. Sites now occur up to 1.5km further downstream than the previously reported limit and include the first records of spawning below the Woolston Cut. Spawning sites in the Avon/Ōtākaro catchment also occur in new locations. In the mainstem, sites now occur both upstream and downstream of all previously reported locations. A concentrated area of spawning was identified in Lake Kate Sheppard at a distinctly different location versus pre-quake records, and no spawning was found on the western shores. Spawning was also recorded for the first time in Anzac Creek, a nearby waterway connected to Lake Kate Sheppard via a series of culverts.","WCFM & MERG Research Report 2016-002",,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/13524",,"en",,,,"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/","Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International",,,,,"Spatial effects of the Canterbury earthquakes on inanga spawning habitat and implications for waterways management",,"Reports",,,,,,,,

A large scale ecological restoration project has been underway since 2013 on Cobden Island. The project has made considerable progress towards its objectives. The level of weed control being maintained has been very successful and the lack of gorse, broom, and blackberry is notable considering the size of site and high light levels. In most places a dense grass sward has developed grading into rushes and herbs in many wetter areas creating a mosaic of riparian vegetation types. Within the artificial channel network, a variety of in-stream habitats were also noted as a result of different channel widths, incision depths, shading, exposure to flood tide flows, and sedimentation rates. With regards to īnanga spawning habitat, the project has hugely increased the length of river/channel bank available for spawning by 7 km, with few comparable sites in New Zealand.",,,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/13522","en",,,,"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/","Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International",,,,,"Cobden wetlands īnanga habitat assessment and recommendations for future management",,"Reports",,,,,,,,

In these areas, species, habitats and ecosystems that are adapted to brackish conditions are expected to migrate in response to salinity changes under sea level rise. For the Avon Heathcote Estuary in Christchurch, an existing fine scale hydrodynamic model was available but not calibrated for salinity. A collaborative project was designed between the University of Canterbury and NIWA to calibrate the model and develop a scenario modelling approach for sea level rise at a level of resolution sufficient for understanding potential effects on important habitats. The purpose of this report is to provide a description of the model development process and an illustration of model outputs from an initial set of modelled scenarios for sea level rise.","Report prepared for Brian Mason Scientific & Technical Trust.

This includes protection from erosion, inundation, and storm surge events, and may include disaster risk reduction benefits in large magnitude events. However, New Zealand’s coastal dune ecosystems have become heavily modified in recent decades and the space available for dunes has become severely restricted in many areas. The restoration and protective management of indigenous dune ecosystems is now an urgent conservation issue. Since plant communities influence dune form and dynamics, the protection of dune biodiversity is important to their coastal hazard management role. The management of dunes as Protected Areas is now a common approach and can be especially important in locations where development and land use patterns have encroached on the space available for dunes, or where intensive management responses to other threats are required. There are now many examples of dune restoration projects at sites where former dunes had largely disappeared, or where the dune plant community has been impacted by invasive species. These projects provide opportunities to assess the potential for protected area management to deliver benefits for coastal hazard management within an integrated approach to coastal management. Additionally, forward planning for the adaptive management of coastlines is needed in the context of predicted sea level rise, and includes consideration of the values of protected areas and the future roles they may play. This case study presents results from an example of restorative dune management within the Christchurch Coastal Park network with a focus on the potential roles of these parks in disaster risk reduction and adaptation to climate change.",,,,"978-2-8317-1687-9",,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/13526","en",,,"IUCN, Gland, Switzerland",,"All Rights Reserved",,,,,"Potential roles for coastal protected areas in disaster risk reduction and climate change adaptation: a case study of dune management in Christchurch, New Zealand",,"Chapters",,,,,,,,

"18184","10092/13511",,"Orchard, Shane||Hickford, Mike",,,"2017","Īnanga (Galaxias maculatus) is one of five galaxiid species that provide New Zealand’s ‘whitebait’ fishery. Four of the five species are also threatened to various degrees. The management of whitebait species is therefore important for conservation objectives as well as for maintaining the fishery. Aside from regulations on fishing activities (which target the juvenile fish on their migration from the ocean into freshwater systems) the degradation of habitat is a particular focus. Although all life stages are important, the protection of spawning habitat may be particularly important for īnanga. It is found in very specific places on the riparian margins of coastal waterways. These areas have become degraded by historical activities associated with urbanisation and other intensive land uses near waterways. These changes have the potential to dramatically impact on fish populations since the inanga life cycle is relatively short (1 -2 years). Poor spawning success in one season can be expected to reduce the stock of whitebait and adult populations in the next season. Repeat cycles of this may very quickly diminish fish stocks - especially if it occurs at many spawning sites simultaneously. In reality, some rivers have become ‘sinks’ that contribute little to maintaining stocks each year1. The fish population is reliant on other rivers (the ‘sources’) where spawning success is higher.",,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/14586",,"en",,,,"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/","Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International",,,,,"Survey method for locating īnanga spawning sites at a catchment scale",,"Reports",,,,,,,,
"18334","10092/13511",,"Orchard, Shane",,,"2017","A recent NZ Geographic article has stirred up an already vigorous debate (see the full article here goo.gl/TcWWU8). “What we call ‘whitebait’ are the juveniles of five fish species: giant kōkopu, banded kōkopu, shortjaw kōkopu, īnanga and kōaro. The first is predicted to go extinct by 2020, the second by 2023, and the rest by 2034”.
The key point here is extinction. It refers to the death of the last individual. If the above predictions were correct this would occur in 3, 6 and 17 years for these species.
Such extinction might occur through one of these 3 events:
1) all adult fish die before spawning
2) spawning occurs but the eggs die
3) eggs hatch but larvae and juvenile (whitebait) mortality causes extinction (or contributes to #1)
The presence of whitebait shows that adult fish have successfully bred. Whitebait numbers have declined since historical times yet the current trend is impossible to gauge and likely fluctuates between years. The life cycle depends of producing lots of juvenile whitebait, most of which will die. Those making it to adulthood are the breeders for the next generation.",,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/10092/14896",,"en",,,,"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/","Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International",,,,,"Whitebait and the extinction debate: Why the whitebait fishery debate may not alleviate conservation concerns",,,,,,,,,,
